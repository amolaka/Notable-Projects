        "    \"There’s certainly nothing you haven’t seen before in other post-apocalyptic shows. However, the cast makes a strong case for their characters and there’s absolutely potential for something intriguing should the series be granted additional seasons.\",\n",

        "    \"Fallout hits the landing well, and stands amongst some of the best video game adaptations out there. For fans, it’ll be catnip: who would have thought the apocalypse could be so enjoyable?\",\n",

        "    \"Despite never having played the game before, I had a lot of fun with Fallout. I was impressed by the world building and enjoyed the retro futuristic aesthetic and design. Although the wacky tone wasn't always for me, it was still extremely entertaining!\",\n",
        "    \"Fallout is an appropriately named show for many reasons, not the least of which is its effect upon the viewer. It’s a take-no-prisoners explosion right out the gate, but the real effectiveness only sets in once it’s had a chance to linger.\",\n",
        "    \"A freaking blast! Amazing production, bloody violent action and an awesome, wickedly dark sense of humor. Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan nailed the gonzo tone. Another huge victory for video game to live-action adaptations. [Full review in Spanish]\",\n",

        "    \"Opting for a new narrative that simply takes place in the Fallout world, the series is a mix of adventure and puzzle-box mystery, with more than enough action scenes to satisfy the RPG faithful. It's fun, and only occasionally overcomplicated.\",\n",
        "    \"Fallout takes the ideas of the games and crafts its own story in an already interesting world. Nails the satire, the wackiness, and about everything a fan could want.\",\n",
        "    \"This series perfectly captures the feel of this bonkers game. It is filled with Easter eggs and references that will have gamers jumping out of their seats, but there is enough suspenseful story to keep non-players interested and begging for more, too.\",\n",

        "    \"Very Westworld with Nolan & Joy behind the scenes on both. The ending is slightly underwhelming but overall an amazing show. Stellar cast & world-building. 1950s Americana juxtaposed with modern dystopia is fascinating. Also surprisingly funny.\",\n",

        "    \"It’s strong, it’s goddamn hilarious, and it highlights exactly how to swing for the fences while still knowing where Homebase is. It may be a new series, but Fallout is an instant classic of the streaming age.\",\n",

        "    \"FALLOUT is a dream come true for fans of the game (like me) and a MASTERPIECE OF MAYHEM! Walton Goggins steals every damn scene and is the heart of the series. We really are living in the golden age of video game adaptations and Fallout is further proof.\",\n",

        "    \"Fallout expands on the big ideas of the games, making it an adaptation worth watching both for fans and those unfamiliar. It’s an equal parts funny and nightmarish show that, like its protagonist, isn’t content to live inside a projection of the past.\",\n",
        "    \"A slightly sluggish journey across a giddily realized world.\",\n",
        "    \"There's really nothing like Fallout on television right now, and that's ultimately a good thing.\",\n",

        "    \"The tone, the visuals, the meticulous attention to the detail of the game world is a far cry from some other adaptations-which-will-not-be-named that try to completely blaze their own path. This is extraordinarily faithful to the games.\",\n",
        "    \"A monumental achievement of sci-fi world-building, presenting an alternately horrifying and exhilarating vision of a United States held together by little more than duct tape and Wonder Glue, unflagging optimism and ultra-violent mercilessness.\",\n",

        "    \"Season five of this lavish and increasingly ludicrous presentation is a watery, witless and entirely useless endeavour.\",\n",
        "    \"I would say that of all the screen Dianas we have had... Debicki is the best. The trouble is that Diana was so much better than anyone else could ever be at playing herself.\",\n",

        "    \"Few premières have been as fervently anticipated as that of the Netflix series' latest season, the first following the Queen's death. But the ten episodes are a startling letdown -- a decline that parallels the monarchy's own.\",\n",

        "    \"As it charts the royal family's continued expulsion from their pedestal in season five, The Crown remains as superbly written and as addictive as ever.\",\n",
        "    \"The sense of broad historical sweep reaching back into a very different era that made the early seasons so compelling has been supplanted by what feels like a rehashing of familiar stories from TV and the tabloids.\",\n",

        "    \"The show’s fifth installment is both more simplistic and less coherent than past seasons.\",\n",
        "    \"Staunton's Elizabeth feels somewhat softer and more wistful at times than her predecessors' versions of the queen, but perhaps that is simply what comes with age — and with four decades on the throne.\",\n",
        "    \"The Crown has been great... and it’s still pretty good. Yet given the highs that the younger versions of these characters delivered, to borrow from the Queen, watching the current season feels more like a preference than a requirement.\",\n",
        "    \"For four seasons, the show wove plots and emotions together to get to a point where it could thoughtfully dissect the meaning of all of it. Now, we’re here, and it has been well worth the wait.\",\n",
        "    \"Though nothing can rival the Emmy-winning 2020 chapters, Season 5 still proves an ambitious and addictive blast of delicious royal intrigue. The new cast, led by Imelda Staunton as the Queen and dynamite Elizabeth Debicki as Diana, is sheer perfection.\",\n",

        "    \"This was once a superior costume drama, moments of 20th-century history packaged into an upmarket soap opera. But as the storylines catch up with the present, the show is edging towards trashy telenovela.\",\n",

        "    \"Slow Horses continues to be ludicrously implausible, and I wish Lamb and Diana would verbally spar more often (it’s so rare it feels like script rationing), but it’s still got the touch.\",\n",

        "    \"And among car chases worthy of Hollywood blockbusters and several edge-on-your-seat shoot-outs, what makes Slow Horses season 4 essential viewing is that it’s all about relationships.\",\n",

        "    \"Still, such moments of earnestness are never overplayed in a show that, perhaps more than any other right now, celebrates that distinctly British penchant for caustic wit and withering cynicism.\",\n",
        "    \"Slow Horses never rushes and also never feels like a grueling slow burner. Like any good thriller, it doesn’t waste time and pays meticulous attention to how the plot should weave together by the end of the season.\",\n",
        "    \"With this level of output, you’d be forgiven for assuming the quality would vary wildly, and yet Slow Horses has become that most wondrous of things: a truly reliable televisual crowd-pleaser.\",\n",

        "    \"The Morning Show is as daft as Dynasty with twice the hair, but its excess is the secret of its success. Aniston and fellow big noise Reese Witherspoon are in charge and relishing it. The rest of us are along for the wildly enjoyable ride.\",\n",
        "    \"The loopy plotting may be hard to embrace initially, but it straightens out before the last few episodes and gives Aniston one of the best acting showcases in her career.\",\n",
