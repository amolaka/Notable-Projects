"Excellent","I can't recommend Shogun enough! This is one of those rare shows that's a must watch. It takes place in Japan during the 1600' where Lord Yoshii Torango is turned on by Council of Regents and they try to kill him and his people. Then he finds a mysterious European ship marooned with its crew in a nearby village and everything changes from what he finds on it. This series has the look and feel of a blockbuster movie. Its world building, character development and attention to detail is as good as anything you'll see in tv. FX usually does a great job with its shows and Shogun is no different. I'll be shocked if this isn't nominated for several awards.",10
"An amazing television achievement but different from the book","This is stunning television. The costumes, the sets, the historic period acting are all phenomenal. This show simply oozes dedication to detail and money. So with just two episodes in I can say that this will hook you almost immediately and for fans of Japan and its ancient culture it is almost a must-see.Knowing the book the casting is near pitch-perfect or at least close enough to it. Maybe Lady Mariko doesn't look as I imagined her from the book but the actress still delivers a good performance and I am deeply appreciative of this show for making a worthy effort to depict the vast and intricate world of James Clavell's masterful historic novel.However, maybe the book is too big to fit into the confined space of a TV series. For obvious reasons the showrunners had to rush through so much that is explained and described in detail in the book. In order to do the book justice it would have taken almost two seasons of television to show the story of John Blackthorne before he even reaches Osaka. Much of the underlying conflicts and the delicate web of diplomacy and intrigue the main characters have to navigate are cut short in the TV show. There also is a weird shift in perspective which strays from the book. Whereas the involvement of Portuguese foreigners in the politics of early 17th century Japan is treated as just another aspect in a mostly internal Japanese power struggle, the TV show almost sets the Portuguese up as the main antagonists of the show during its first two episodes. I hope the shows swings back to the Japan-centric story it is meant to be.Bottom line: This is great television but I recommend reading the book eventually.",9
"Best thing I've seen for a long time","When I saw the title on the Disney channel I assume it's one of those mock Asian war drama we always see on the screen with fake mock Asian token actors like we always see. I can not be more wrong. The richness in characters is built on real Japanese actors who are world class actors in the film/Tv industry and the depiction of the religious and political tension is something I have not seen on a main stream service for long time. Not to mention how rare we get to hear Japanese spoken with majority of the air time on an English language channel. This authentic Japanese/Englsih drama is exceptionally well made and has the potential to lead the white audience into a new realm of Asian western fusion genre. I expect some awards to be won shortly.",10
"Amazing series","Everything is just spot on with this series!I get that Americans aren't used to reading subtitles, but come on. So what if the series is mostly in Japanese? It's about an English man stuck in Japan in the 17th century. Why wouldn't it be in Japanese?The acting, staging, camera shots, editing, direction - everything is 10 out of 10.I rarely give a 10 after just two episodes, but this is an amazing series. I rarely give anything a ten. This is probably one of the best series I've seen the last ten years.Mark my words - this'll get an Emmy for sure! If you haven't watched it, be sure to do. It's exciting, full of history and just a gem to watch.",9
"Award winning","I was eagerly awaiting the new Shogun series, especially as a fan of the original series featuring Richard Chamberlain. This reboot surpasses its predecessor with a richer focus on Japanese characters, enhancing the drama significantly. While most of the cast delivered outstanding performances, Cosmo Jarvis seemed somewhat stiff and lacked emotional depth in his role as the Englishman who unexpectedly sails to Japan. Anna Sawai stands out exceptionally as the interpreter who falls for the Englishman, showcasing her acting prowess, particularly in the final two episodes. The storyline adeptly portrays Lord Toranaga's cunning strategies to ascend as Japan's leader while avoiding war. Jarvis's role as the Anjin serves as a cultural bridge for the audience. Shogun is a strong contender for numerous awards this year. Impressively executed.",8
"Toranagasama isn't worthy","In this 10-episode series we are led to side with the character of Toranaga, a Japanese lord whose life, and the life of everyone in his corner, is at risk at the hands of the other ruling regents. The way the show depicts Toranaga at first is the classic take on a strongwilled man, who is vilified because he is too much of a risk to the remainder of the ruling parties. The five men were supposed to rule in unison until the king comes of age, however, one man seems to go against the will of the other four and therefore is persecuted. We are led to believe that the four regents are the vile and egoistical ones, giving in to greed and foreign christian influence over the wellbeing of their own people. Lord Toranaga, on the other hand, supposedly goes against this, wishing to survive and bring prosperity with his vision.This carefully crafted image shatters in the last minutes of episode 8 and subsequently in ep 10. The man plays the underdog, pretends he is ready to give up so that his followers are all the more riled up and urge him to fight on. He gaslights his generals into signing an agreement to give up, he has his most trusted advisor and lifelong friend commit seppuku as part of his plan. He sacrifices lady Mariko into giving her life to him as well, so that he can free hostages who are on his side and manipulate the king's mother into assisting him. He then orders for the Anjin's ship to be burned and tortures the whole village, killing innocent people, pretending to be looking for the culprits of the burning, all as a twisted test to see how the Anjin would behave. He claims to be humble, to be ready to sacrifice himself for the good of the realm. He is not. He is ruthless, trecherous, absolutely obsessed with power, holding human life in no regard, killing people at whim. And the worst of it all, he will kill off anyone in his circle, be it his loyalists or regular villagers, just to prove a point. There is nothing noble about this man.This series leaves you wondering whether you have been rooting for the wrong side all along and feeling that all of this 10-hour investment has been wasted. Especially that, after you learn of Toranaga's villainy, there is absolutely no follow up to see how the other characters react to this man having his way and what the fallout of all this is to the general people.",10
"Brilliant !","This was a most waiting tv series for 2024! And it is true! The two first episodes were just perfect! Mr Sanada is perfect to his role as lord toranaga as perfect are the two allies ( blackthorne and mariko)!We have a short story at the beginning to understand the culture of feudal japan at 1590 as the teaser trailer released two weeks ago !Customs , cgi , has many details ( shoes , helmets, armor, etc) as it was at 1600 bc at feudal japan !Story is writen on japan culture as well!So far so perfect! Its truly based to james clavel novel more than 80s series ! Waiting for the next episodes to see !",9
"Finally, something authentic and worth watching","With only 2 episodes out so far, I find this show to be really well done whether or not you have read the book or saw the 1980 mini-series with Richard Chamberlain. Hiroyuki Sanada is one of my favourite actors and his performance, as well as the other cast members is superb. The show is very authentic looking and most of the dialogue is in Japanese, which really adds to the atmosphere and gives you a sense of being in 1600s Japan. Except for one scene (IMHO), the cinematography is really good. Unlike the 1980 series, there is a darker ""feel"" which better portrays what was going on at that time. Looking forward to seeing the rest of the series.",7
"Worth a watch but could've been better","Shogun is everything I hoped it would be and more. I've been looking forward to this ever since I first heard about it. I thought my expectations were going to be too much and it'd be somewhat of a let down but it wasn't. It was everything I'd hoped it would be and more. I love this kind of genre. This premise kind of looked like The Last Samurai movie with Tom Cruise and I loved that movie as well. The story is told from the perspective of a British hero named John Blackthorne as he helps Lord Torango in his war. This series just pulls you into their world and doesn't let go and you don't want it to. It's gotten nothing but great reviews and currently has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. It was also just rightfully nominated for a bunch of Emmy's including Best Drama, Best Actor (Hiroyuki Sanada), Best Actress (Anna Sawai), Best Supporting Actor (Takehiro Hira & Tadanobu Asano) & Outstanding Guest Actor (NÃ©stor Carbonell). I've literally enjoyed every second of this and can't wait for the seasons 2 and 3!",5
"They come to talk, and die, and talk some more","I have fond memories of the series from the 80's.This started very impressively from every perspective. My partner became so fascinated by it that he read the book super quickly.But after around the 3rd episode my patience ran very thin.All the visual aspects of the show are incredibly authentic and impressive. What let the show down for me is the way the story is told.Japan is portrayed as a massive death cult. People die at the drop of a hat to defend someone else's honour / face or whatever. With 10 hours of screen time you thought they might have time to portray some interesting / fun aspects of life at the time. But all you ever see is the ways people are killed or kill themselves, and a bunch of selfish old men wanting the power for it's own sake while being depressed about it. From what I remember GOT is like that too , that's why I stopped watching early in series 2. But remembering the 80's series and knowing this won't run to 7 seasons I persevered.My partner said the book doesn't tell it like that at all. In fact so many storylines have been altered that it makes very little dramatic sense. Towards the end it's just talk and talk. It seems the producers wanted to avoid any big battle scene at all costs, so the characters just talk about how it all ends.The Blackthorn character seems to understand no Japanese one minute, and totally fluent another. This especially when his translator is gone is very baffling.For all it's flaws the old series afforded some satisfaction when it ended. This just left me scratching my head.",8
"Very well made, but never actually goes anywhere. Endless carrot on a stick...","I'm a western guy who's a huge Japanophile, loving the country's history and culture. I used to live in Tokyo. I go on vacations to Japan regularly. Naturally, I love samurai stuff. So, I was super hyped about this series. Probably hadn't been so hyped for anything since Game of Thrones. I always expected someone like me to love this show, and for other people who are less gung hoo about this kind of stuff, to maybe find it average. So to see everyone else love it so much, hailing it as the best series in a long time, glowing 9's everywhere, while I myself of all people, am left feeling dissatisfied, feels kind of surreal...True, this show has impeccable sets, costumes (they said in an interview that they made the costumes from scratch, for each person, to make them as real and authentic as possible. Super awesome), cinematography, and acting, and also interesting characters, and an AWESOME setting. This much I agree with. But see, the story, it never actually reaches a satisfying conclusion, a payoff for all the build up. It just fades out into nothing in the end. The entire series teases war, and huge battles, but there is none of that, even until the end of the very last episode. In fact, there's almost no action at all. We never get to see the bad guys get theirs. We also never get to see the end result of Toranaga's plans and ambition, and all the sacrifices that are made along the way. Which is another thing; so many people die along the way, and I find it increasingly hard to root for Toranaga sacrificing them all for his cause. Mariko's death in particular left a really bitter taste in my mouth. As an insight into the culture, history, customs, and daily life of Edo time period Japan, this is all very interesting, and very well made, but as STORY, this is very unsatisfying, I feel.",8
"Lost me a bit in the end","I was 10/10 on this, got very into the series initially and was thinking of it a lot, always looking forward to that next episode. Very well directed and written, the camera effect was sometimes not to my liking but gave a unique style so that didnt bother me too much. However, I found the ending to be somewhat anti-climatic, the 9th episode was amazing and kinda feels like the last episode was some weird epilogue. Also the first half of the series had a great build up, then it started feeling like nothing was gonna happen. And nothing did happen.. sort off, action and war/battle wise. I dont need battles and sieges but it felt of after having that build up.. even in the intro showing war and sieges.",9
"Renewing the show for two seasons gave the finale much credibility","As someone who watched the show after it was confirmed to have two seasons, I feel that the finale felt much better and not as lackluster as if it were the entire series finale. The problem was that we kept hearing about War throughout the season, and it was inevitable. Even at the beginning of the final episode, it was mentioned more than once. So It was strange to see the show ending with 0 implications of any war. And the thing is, it boggles my mind that this was originally the series finale after spending ten episodes preparing for a war and betrayal/sacrifice. I initially gave the show seven, but since it has been renewed, the finale episode feels more like an excellent introduction for the next season.",8
"To anyone who remembers the 1980's Richard Chamberlain ""Shogun""...","...this is not that.While it was certainly groundbreaking and a huge hit at the time, in retrospect great parts of it was rather cheasy and cheapish, and come on, none of us REALLY bought Richard Chamberlain as a rugged and battle hardened sea officer ;)The 2024 version feels a great deal more modern and budgeted bigger.It's rougher, it's dirtier, the action scenes are crafted much better, the camera work is much better and reminds you of a Hollywood blockbuster, the lighting and visuals are stunning to the point of being art, and they are underlined by sound effects and a score which amplifies the mood of every scene perfectly.The script is much richer and intricate than the original series, with better dialogue allowing the much enlarged gallery of characters more complexity and debth, which is especially important to American and European audiences, when depicting a very ""foreign"" culture... and it is all perfectly executed by a stellar cast, some of whom are getting their international breakthrough on this show.I just love it, it's probably not only the show of the year, but something we will constantly crave more of in years to come, and which competitors will try to copy.I should mention this is based off the first 6 episodes, so we are yet to see large scale battle scenes (but looking at the teaser clips, they look exellent), and we are yet to see the all important ending so I will reserve a possible 10 for then - but I am quite hopeful that is where it lands.It's a show that makes you annoyed it is a limited series, by nature of James Clavell having written only one novel on feudal Japan.. but I actually predict this will be such a big hit, that FX will attempt to have scripts written for either a prequal, continuation - or spin offs - because that period of Japanese history is ripe with potential - and come on, who doesn't like samurais?This is a must see show, even if you don't like samurais, even if you don't like period dramas, even if you don't like foreign language entertainment, even if you don't like subtitles - because if you don't watch it, you will be the person left out of the conversation, when the topic becomes entertainment.Enjoy :)",8
"If I could use words like scattering flowers and falling leaves","Is it historically accurate? No. Neither the source material (novel) is. Is the show fully novel-accurate? No. Some things were changed, in order to tell the story for this show, and it works mostly??There is some ""modern"" injected, although not too much, just it would seem that ""we"" can never separate fully from the time we exist in, thus our time's ""bits and pieces"", follow us on all our ""time travels"".., also as authentic it looks, still it only looks..Have to admit that for quite some time, I haven't liked a TV show character as much as have Mariko, or Fuji, etc, while aware of figures from history, sad and happy at the same time, that the show stayed, more or LESS, true to it overall, ""underwhelming"" finale included..Premise describes events leading to creation of (most powerful) longest lasting Shogunate, where ""Sacrifice of the Few"" was prioritized and made for ""The good of Japan"", thus, no large battles as well as attempting to avoid those same, is also more or less, true to it all..As I'm writing my review, more than couple months after I saw the show, my question, or complaint is: ""seasons two and three""?? This was obviously supposed to be a Limited Series that deals with this part, thus additional seasons will follow the events post creation particular Shogunate? An era of ""Japan's closed borders"" and ""expelling of"" the Catholics""? Is Shogun going to become Anthology Series??? What are we going to watch exactly part of additional seasons??It would seem the show got ""renewed"" for additional seasons only to have an entrance into ""Drama Series"" promptly. Let's just hope that ""business models"" don't leave a bad mark on this well made, and obviously Limited Series, down the line..",10
"Almost great, but...","I like it, the acting is really good, the visuals are awesome, the pacing is good and the overall story is great, so why does it fall short for me? Because it is an increadibly shallow adaptation of Clavell's book.Clavell's book is about a stranger in a strange land, meaning understanding cultural differences, and the major themes are about honor, duty, sacrifice, and power. And that is the problem as I see it because besides the acting and the visuals - which are great - the story actually lacks these elements or gloss over them as if they are not important. But they are! It's what makes the book (and the 80's version great). Here's a couple of examples: We don't really get to know why Blackthorne (Anjin) is important, or the role of christianity in Japan, or pretty much any other social aspect of Japanese culture. There is sub-plot about a petulant and reckless son, which I don't remember from the book, and I have no idea what the point of him is, except for the writers to add to the story themselves. Similarly, Mariko from the book and the 80's version is probably my favorite character after Blackthorne, and I don't really recognize her in this version; by making her tougher, they also make her more distant and it diminishes her inner strength which makes her less sympathetic (to me at least).In a nutshell this is what i see as the problem, when the show sticks to the book's original themes it is awesome, when they they don't you see actions taken where you sit back and say ""that was weird why do that?"" And here's the kicker, the very best dialogs and scenes are taken verbatim out of the book, so it's not like the writers don't understand that the source material is superior.Still, the show is absolutely watchable, but I always measure a show's quality by whether I want to rewatch it, and I doubt it, instead I actually feel like watching the 80's version instead - that's not really a glowing endorsement is it?",10
"Actually spectacular","When I first heard about this show, I figured it would just be another cringeworthy Western depiction of Shogunate Japan. But then I read about the glowing reviews, and decided to determine the accuracy of those reviews myself. And my my, this show is indeed amazing.I've never heard of the book, much less read it, but as a fan of world history, I found the depiction of the political intricacies of feudal Japan to be fascinating.2 episodes in, and I hadn't even realised how fast the time had gone. I just found myself glued to the screen from start to finish. Such fantastic work from a talented cast of actors. What a shame that this is only going to be a limited series!",10
"As of episode 5 this is the best show of 2024","I watched the original Shogun on VHS when I was a teenager (a long time ago) and was hugely impressed.This updated version trumps it.Something remarkable airing on the Disney channel, which apart from the The Bear doesn't happen a lot!Cosmo Jarvis plays a brilliantly flawed British sailor stranded in feudal Japan.His portrayal is gruff, funny and realistic in his fish out of water role.All of the supporting cast are absolutely fantastic as well.Giving the Anjin some funny looks and some angry responses when required.This series doesn't glamorise the outdated and barbaric practice of Sepukku which is great to see. But it also doesn't shy from it. It happened.The colours of the Samurai blue uniforms/armour is very realistic and the battle scenes are brutal and to the point.I'm very excited to see the rest of the series.",3
"Nice","Story follows English sailor John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis) as he lands on the shores of feudal Japan. His appearance sparks an unlikely alliance with Lord Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), who faces challenges from rival lords vying for leadership. Mariko (Anna Sawai), an outcast from a notorious family, serves as Blackthorne's translator, connecting their intertwined fates.What sets this adaptation apart is its interwoven character arcs. The show delves beyond the Western outsider's perspective, allowing Japanese characters to become fully fleshed-out individuals. Confusion and enchantment bind both parties, transcending orientalism.Balances political strife with interpersonal relaonships, creating a fresh take on Clavell's work. It's a sweeping historical epic that proves shows of this caliber can still achieve greatness. From stunning battle sequences to emotional depth, this reinvention delivers on every level.",9
"Uh....Ten Hours of Buildup to What, Exactly?","My least favorite part of any action movie is usually the ""boss fight"". But my god this show demonstrates why you need one. There was about ten minutes left in the last episode when the horrible realization sunk in on me.....this is going to crest on the closing credits shore as the weakest tsunami in history.All that buildup......to nothing.The show has some great acting and wonderful scenes. The scenes would have looked better with a little less Vaseline on the lens, but that's the style these days. Better than ""shaky-cam"" I guess. And insane amounts of detail went into costumes and dialogue, and I do love that. But we end up with.....next to nothing.Also our main European character was just outright annoying. I kept waiting for him to find his footing and stop acting like an overly excited chihuahua, but it never happens. Even after he earns the respect of his Japanese hosts. It makes his rise in stature that much more inexplicable.Can't imagine ever watching it again.",8
"Highly recommended","I've just finished the first two episodes and I cannot wait for more! The atmosphere, plot, acting are superlative. The politicking and scheming are prime Game of Thrones but I hate making that comparison as I want this show to stand on its own. The scheming between the various lords and the Portuguese faction is titillating and suspenseful as we watch various characters play the game. I love it! I cannot wait for next week. I haven't felt this way about a show in a long while. Highly recommended if you enjoy top tier drama.Funny to see most one star review being uneducated people who complain about subtitles.Japanese should never be dubbed. If you can't read, move to something your level like barbie.",8
"An amazing political drama show","This show really made me to binge watch it as it gets interesting with every episode and for me the end of season 1 is sufficient. The sets and cinematic view with the culture of Japan's sengoku period which is most splendid thing of the show, plus the performance by the actors genuinely makes it perfect. The screenplay was impeccable you can't find any flaw while watching the scenes going forward with actors into there character and listening the Japanese dialogue giving chills! At last an incredibly show created by Rachel kondo and Justin marks and the intriguing novel (which the show is based on) written by James clavell.",10
"Great quality production that stays pretty close to the source material, strongly recommend checking it out.","Beautifully told story, based on the 1975 James Clavell novel with the same name, of feudal Japan. The story is told from the perspective of an Englishman who is shipwrecked and taken hostage. After watching a fellow shipmate be boiled alive, John Blackthorne becomes the fastest talking man on the ship. He also slowly endears himself to Lord Toranaga, who seems to be in a battle for power that he doesn't really want. He assigns a married woman named Mariko to be a translator for the smelly white barbarian they call Anjin.Visually stunning, this story is about honor, sacrifice, loyalty, betrayal, the quest for power, survival, and strategy. It is almost like a beautiful game of chess, where pieces are sacrificed for the ultimate goal.I think the series is worth watching for the production quality alone. It really is stunning. I appreciate that things aren't overly explained like the role of Christianity, and specifically the Catholic Church in Japan...as well as the animosity between the non-Catholic and Catholic Christians. This and so many other cultural differences are shown or alluded to in quiet or more subtle ways. This is not the most romantic of stories, but I think people who appreciate strategy and high production quality...as well as fans of Shogun itself, will enjoy this series and it is a recommendation from me.",10
"It Worked For Me","I really liked this series. I didn't watch the Richard Chamberlain series, so I didn't know the story. I liked coming into this raw, because everything was a surprise.They spent a ton of money on the budget, and it shows. Great, scenic shots. Completely immersive. Costumes, locations, sets all 100% real to me.Other reviews talked about VFX. Evidently, the tech has improved to the point that, when it is done correctly, the average viewer can't tell. For this show, I couldn't tell. Everything was real to me.Midway through, I was hoping for another season, but the last two episodes made me realize there was nothing left to tell. The death of one of the characters was devastating and I couldn't imagine another season without her.I have one rule for a TV series or movie: It is either a success or a dud, based on one thing- did I feel immersed? Did I buy into it and lose myself in the story? With this one, the answer was yes.Really, that's all I need to know. If I find myself questioning the plot, the dialogue, the casting, the sets, etc. Then it didn't work. Harsh, but that's the job - either sell it or fail.",9
"Spectacular, Stylish and Brilliant","I don't really have anything else to say that hasn't already been said about Shogun. Politically, it's extremely rich and feels pretty thoughtful and clever with the game every single character plays throughout the season. It's mature, stylish, gorgeous, feels truly well structured, and never relies on nudity or big battle sequences. Every single line of dialogue that's been shared between the characters expresses their motives precisely, whether it's their greed for power, fears, or determination towards their duty.Hiroyuki, Anna, Cosmo, and every actor truly made this show what it is; there isn't a single conversation where I kept my eyes away from the screen, even for a second, because the drama and tension are there from the start, and it's truly immersive. The female characters were the best; they were brave, dutiful, and stayed behind the eightfold fence but never shied away from breaking it whenever necessary. Yabushige was still my favorite, though. It doesn't try to oversimplify the complexity of its world and respects its audience's ability to properly get along with its world. I already admire how impressive the Japanese culture is, but Shogun portrays it brilliantly. Whether it's the spectacular setpieces, gorgeous landscapes, or the fine and colorful outfits, it excels in everything with its massive budget.The finale reveal wasn't unexpected and justifies what Toranaga has been saying all along: ""You are playing a game of friends and enemies when you have only yourself in this life."" Although I was expecting a stronger closure, I'm mostly satisfied with how things wrapped up. I'll say it again: Shogun is a remarkable show, and I couldn't recommend it enough.",10
"Almost a ""10"" until the final episode 10","There are many excellent reviews already posted so I'll keep my comments brief.I enjoyed the adventure, physical, psychological & political dangers that Blackthorne, Toranaga & Mariko faced with courage, cunning & understated humor. The build up was excellent. However, the final episode was anti-climatic & disappointing. ""Crimson sky"" was primarily a battle plan mixed with political maneuvering (according to the novel). The story was building up to a battle for power between Toranaga & Ishido. So I had all this pent up energy & excitement waiting for a release upon witnessing the battle & seeing the outcome. But instead, the outcome is described in a brief conversation between Yabushige & Toranaga. Truly disappointing. I was almost ready to give a ""10"" rating, but the awful finale I had to reduce the rating to an ""8"".I had no problem with Toranaga's maneuvering seen in the light of the historical context & mindset.I enjoyed the comedic aspects adapted into Yabushige's character.One thing that remains unclear to me, besides the Portuguese rutter, was there a rutter maintained by Blackthorne? If so, I would think Blackthorne would have used English. As far as I know, Mariko's was not able to read/write or speak English so how was she able to read his Rutter? I am unconvinced that she read his rutter. Oh well ....Overall good show, but like GoT a disappointing finish.",8
"Fantastic; beautiful","Shogun (which I'm not permitted to spell correctly as the macron O is an ""invalid character"") is a masterfully written and artistically splendid adaptation of the 1975 James Clavell novel of the same name (which was also adapted for TV in 1980 -- I'm told that if you belong to the same generation as my parents, this was more than likely the first Japanese you ever heard/learned). In this version, we get Cosmo Jarvis as the marooned Englishman John Blackthorne; Anna Sawai as the troubled Lady Mariko, who becomes his translator; and a phenomenal Hiroyuki Sanada as Lord Toranaga, a mighty daimyo who becomes the target of other regents in Japan in a story that shows the dawn of Tokugawa shogunate.It's a bit funny that it came out right around when Denis Villeneuve made his comments about how movies are the ideal place for visual storytelling, whereas TV is more about dialogue. Along comes Shogun, which looks appreciably better than many of the motion pictures we've seen from Hollywood in recent years, most notably in terms of lighting -- Matt Zoller Seitz joked that this show reminded us that good lighting is, in fact, allowed on TV.It's not as ""realistic"" as, say, the murky battle in the Game of Thrones episode The Long Night, but is this what we want in fantastical art? Recall the conversation Peter Jackson had with a crewmember when shooting the Cirith Ungol sequence in Return of the King: ""Where is that light coming from?"" ""The same place as the music.""It's a show that puts in effort and details in ways that too few shows bother to even try. I even noticed environmental details, like a scene set during a period of thawing, where snow can be seen and heard sliding off the building while the characters are speaking -- this wasn't necessary to include, but it helps the show feel more real and immersive, while also denoting the passage of time during Blackthorne's stint as Toranaga's military trainer.There also is the purposeful use of swirly bokeh, especially in shots that show Blackthorne's point-of-view, accentuating the dreamlike and confusing quality that Japan has to him, and of course, the costumes and sets are nigh flawless. It is, simply put, a brilliant work, and the fact that so few are talking about it is a damn pity.",8
"A glorious TV series","This series has it all, a historical series that showcases the rich samurai culture beautifully
The splendor of cities, the beauty of clothes, the way people think, the difference between Western and Eastern culture, the authenticity of Japanese culture, love, betrayal, fear, dramatic and romantic scenes and the nature of furry forests, all of these will nail you to the TV and drag you to the end of the story.I recommend watching this series
Interestingly, this story is based on a historical novel and the screenwriter rewrote it in such a way that you don't get tired of the story. In addition to the elegant and beautiful narration of the story, the artistic acting of the actors and the direction of the series will transform you. The model of walking, sitting, people touching each other, holding swords, striking with swords, everything is wonderful.Do not miss.",9
"flawed yet very good","It's a great show...there's no doubt about that...and all the hype is warranted...usually I'm not a big fan of foreign shows coz I'm not that good with subtitles...but maybe there's a new kind of foreign shows...where there's a bit of English sprinkled in...i watched Tehran and it was a lovely show...and the subtitle thing didn't bother me...coz they also did the sprinkling of English trick...it kinda tricks the mind i guess...but it works...coz i did hold off from seeing this show until i found this out...while the show IS great...it does suffer alot of flaws...there's some plot elements that repeat a bit too much...like the whole Mariko trying to prove to Anjin that life is meaningless...Yabushige not being Trustworthy...the whole dynamic of the council...it just feels like the show is held back by them not elevated by the them...it doesn't use them as instruments but is limited by them...i also don't really believe Anjin and Mariko's relationship...the whole concept of loyalty is not very well depicted...it's just mentioned alot and pushed in your face but there isn't any real showcase on screen...demonstrate just how much loyalty means to this culture...not just the results like people killing themselves and all...show the reasoning behind it...Anjin isn't well portrayed too...poor acting...we don't get enough character development for Toronaga...by the end of the show we still only feel like he's just some smart mysterious guy...and also...there's a few things he logically would have told his allies...but he doesn't...possibly for plot development and all that...but it misses in my opinion...
.But as a whole the good overweighs the bad...and it is a good show...it has to be...for all those flaws and still be this good...i used to call Arcane the best most flawed show ever...this probably comes second...",8
"At First Amazing, Then Disappointing","First couple of episodes are amazing, but conclusion is dissaponting for me.Don't get me wrong, acting is wonderful setting is also but at the end of the season lots of thing seem empty. Blacktorne's necessity has removed in last episodes.I haven't read the book but show makes you expect there will be a epic conclusion at the end of the season like Hiroyuki Sanada will charge into battle, decimate his enemies with the help of Blacktorne's cannons and become Shogun.But show follows very weird way. And this makes Englishman's role very diminished. I mean why he is there at the first place and what is he accomplishing ? He is just there to make love drama with the woman ?First episodes make some expectations on you that with the information provided by Blacktorne, Japan will get rid of Portoguese and their bases.An epic battle scene in Shogunate Japan with samurai is a must. But we don't see anything.I don't know if there will be a second season but I can say that last couple of episodes does not align with first half at all.",6
"Repetitive and at times absurd","1) Some important person
2) Bow
3) Bow more
4) Dramatic conversation
5) Commit seppuku.6) Exhausting japanese ""morality"" lesson
7) Maybe a sex scene or more slahing of the intestines, idk.This is literally the formula for the entire season.Bonus: gaijin always stupid, japanese are intellectual giants.The original series may have been a bit cartoonish and a bit comical at times, the remake does not fail in the same ways but finds new ways instead. Firstly too mich talking and tears. Literally 30-50% of litetally entire series is boring dialogues and tears. The other half are silent scenes of ""reflection"" or awkeardness, then maybe 4% fighting scenes and of course all japanese samurai fight like obedient robots.",4
"Best Historical Fiction I've seen on TV","THIS is how to do compelling historical fiction. It's a disservice to this show to compare it to Game of Thrones, as many have. It's appeal is completely different.A lot of the show's finer details aren't spelled out for people to just take in without some genuine reflection. It really challenges and believes in the intelligence of its audience. And I respect that so much. That's a risk in today's media climate, I'm glad to see it paid off so well.The story is intricate, and filled to the brim with compelling themes and feelings. It balances the perspectives on offer beautifully. Everything feels even handed and very non judgemental to the characters.It's the kind of show that gets better the more you think about it and watch it. And a lot of that is carried by the absolutely fantastic acting performances and direction. Mariko was the highlight for me. It felt like she was the true heart of the story and her actress clearly took her role very seriously.And on top of being well written and emotionally affecting, it's also incredibly well produced.I have no idea what the budget of this show was, but it looks absolutely phenomenal. I love the lenses they used. They have such beautiful blurr quality. And the compositions they create with the cinematography are absolutely beautiful and highlight the mannered and orderly aesthetic of the Japanese culture depicted.And that's not even to mention the show's most impressive aspect: the production design. Holy... S***t, this show is immaculately produced. Perhaps the best set designs and costumes I've ever seen on a TV show. The level of work put into respecting and recreating the history of this time period is nothing short of inspirational.I hope this show serves as an example for other studios/creators seeking to create historical fiction. Or perhaps it could lead to more historical fiction produced with such passion and intelligence. I would love to see tons of historical narratives portrayed in this kind of high end style.But not Alexander the Great, I'm gonna write that myself. I call dibs ;)",9
"Good Enough","Japanese Drama '' Shogun '' is a historical drama based on the same-titled novel.The series has an optimal atmosphere, with costumes and settings being excellent! The lighting and the camera filters also aided in creating the right mood.In addition, the drama had killer performances by everyone in the cast but, especially, the leads and the female lead more precisely. She was a storm indeed and she carried the drama even when things got a bit blunt.As for the story, it was a political thriller with nice twists and an interesting ending.So, overall, eight out of ten for this historical political thriller.",8
"A JAPANESE SENSATION","Am I the only one who thought I could speak fluent Japanese after watching this remarkable work of art? I cannot explain how obsessed I am with this Show, Shogun is the best show I have ever watched, excellent History, Traditions, acting, cast, storyline, It made me wish I had a katana, I loved everything about this show, I will visit Osaka one day and maybe even permanently move to Osaka, this film showed what rich culture is in Japan and I loved it so damn much, Hiroyuki Sanada did an epic job tons of respect for him, If you have not watched Shogun what are you doing with your life? This is the type of show which gives a reason for the existence of television,",10
"Beautiful story","I read the book 20 years ago and watching series one reminded me how much I want to visit Japan. The culture and the people are beautiful. I highly recommend.""Shogun,"" based on the novel by James Clavell, isn't just a TV series; it's a sprawling epic that transports viewers to feudal Japan, weaving a complex tapestry of politics, culture, and intrigue. First airing in 1980 as a mini-series, it pioneered the format and set a high standard for storytelling and production quality on television.The narrative follows John Blackthorne, an English navigator shipwrecked on the Japanese coast during the early 17th century. Blackthorne, played by Richard Chamberlain, finds himself entangled in the lethal politics of the era, surrounded by samurais, ninjas, and warlords. His journey from an outsider to a pivotal player in Japanese politics is compelling and offers a deep dive into the cultural and military machinations of the time.What sets ""Shogun"" apart is its commitment to authenticity. The series takes great pains to accurately depict the samurai code of Bushido and the intricate social hierarchies of Japan. This commitment extends to the use of the Japanese language throughout the series, enhancing the immersive experience but also demanding more from its audience.The performance of Toshiro Mifune as Lord Toranaga is particularly notable. Mifune brings a gravitas and complexity to his character, embodying the wisdom and ruthlessness.",9
"Absolute perfection","By a pretty wide margin - Shogun has been the best show on tv of 2024. A complete masterclass in every sense of the phrase. After it's initial episodes it was compared to early Game of Thrones and obviously that's very high praise but it's completely deserved. After watching this it's almost hard to watch anything else if I'm being honest. With every episode you can see the attention to detail and the perfection of everyone's craft. Why can't all tv be like this? The character arc's, the redemption arc's - the IMMERSION. Every episode I was reeled in and it almost felt like I was on hand learning about the time period and culture. The characters are written beautifully and executed to highest of highs by the actors and actresses. Especially the women of this show - Mariko and Fuji are some of my favorite female characters that tv has had to offer. Absolute scene stealers. Everyone who worked on this deserves all the praise in the world because they truly pulled off perfection. Shogun S1 holds it own against any season from any tv show EVER. ""Accepting death isn't surrender. Flowers are only flowers because they fall.""",10
"A wonderful and fitting tribute to both Clavell's novel and the earlier adaptation","Incredible! As opposed to creating an adaptation ""suitable for modern audiences"" the production team have concentrated on tried and tested principles of entertainment and historical accuracy. And oh, how wonderful it is to return to a time I once thought gone forever! There is a certain dramatic gravitas to the adaptation that absolutely shines through in the writing, along with the sets (which are fantastic). The cinematography is absolutely masterclass and the geographical environment awe-inspiring. The soundtrack is rich and full of promise. Meanwhile, the quality of acting is superlative and finally, my appreciation and thanks go out to the costume designer who goes above and beyond to interpret 17th century Japan.Seriously, I cannot recommend Shogun 2024 enough.Edit. I can't ever remember watching an episode that concluded so soon, and you know why that is? Because the show is so rich in detail, the action utterly in your face and intense dialogue constantly has you re-examining what you thought was going as to have the audience completely engaged.",10
"A superlative TV achievement with a missed opportunity","I have to talk about the positives first before I get into what I felt could've been the peak of authenticity on a television show. I will share my thoughts on the missed opportunity on the last part of the review.I have a deep enjoyment for Japanese culture, having been to Japan myself, there are so many aspects that I am drawn to in modern day Japan but I won't get into it for the sake of the review, I'll keep my focus on the series. It's clear for people familiar with at least a bit of knowledge in Japanese history that its past is quite dark and calling some of the practices and customs morally questionable is an understatement.It's intriguing though that, with all morally ambiguous behavior, specially from a Western point of view and of course taking into consideration that this happened centuries ago, Japan manages to be one of the most interesting and magnetic cultures around the world and this is where the series shines at least from the Japanese perspective.The attention to the detail regarding the entire production, customs, sets, ceremonies, rituals, historical accuracy across many departments, none of this was left for chance, many interviews showed that the producers focused highly on this aspect, with this being a big partnership between the US and Japan, we finally have an American production that tells the story of another nation and allows for the majority of it to be lead and to proper represent that same country (almost, I will get to that).So it has all the ingredients for success, amazing cinematography, amazing locations, amazing CGI, amazing realistic production, amazing cast, spoken for the most part in Japanese (which seems obvious but its an actual achievement for an American production) and of course the plot is incredibly engaging filled with intrigue, a main character that is as much a skilled strategist as it is a functional sociopath, a female lead with a great character development - among others these are all the elements that make this a great show.Where do I point my finger? The Portuguese depiction... I am a Portuguese, and before people start thinking that my issue is that the Portuguese are somewhat the villains here let me tell you I couldn't care less for that aspect. After all this is based on a book from an English man, it is only natural that the main character / hero is English and that there's no mention of the atrocities of English colonialism plus its not even relevant for this plot.Also, I have no illusions of what the Portuguese did as a colonial force and the atrocities of the past, there are no saints during that era so again my issue is not about the plot but rather the language..
So you make the most difficult of all, a TV show spoken more than 70% in a foreign language, for which Americans will need for sure to have subtitles (which is something that American productions struggle with) and you decide to completely omit a single word of Portuguese for the ENTIRE SHOW.. really? You were already adding subtitles for most of it, this is a pure and simple lazy decision out of fear of the show not being successful because it is already for the most part not spoken in English?I am not even arguing that it should've been only in Japanese and Portuguese (which actually would make total sense given these are the only languages being spoken) but at least follow the ""Vikings"" TV show example... when characters share screen time and they don't understand what the other is saying they speak in their own language, for Vikings it was of course old Norse, for Shogun it should've been Portuguese....
You even hired Portuguese actors, Portugal is a core theme throughout the plot, you should've made it justice with at least a few sentences here and there..
Portuguese are proud people and being a small nation we don't get that many noteworthy mentions in main stream global media, when there's an opportunity for that to happen, something that could've been so easy, it's thrown away like that I felt it was a bit of a disservice...
It's still a remarkable TV achievement and I actually do look forward for the original content of seasons 2 and 3, I would prefer Japanese creators involved on an historical drama rather than it being from a Western writer so I am hopeful.",9
"What a remake","I am perhaps one of the few people who first read the book, then saw the first series and now saw this one. I really liked the origianl series and I was quite afraid that this remake would ruin my very positive view of the Shogun story. To make it shot - it did not at all.This Shogun actually they made a smart decision to focus less on the ""navigator"" and more on the political power play in the Japan of that time. Not really what the book did, but it gave this Shogun interpretation a unique perspective and made it more fun to watch for people like me. And in other parts it even stayed closer to Clavell's orginal story than the first series. Let's just say both did take liberties without tarnishing the original book.I did not like how ""Anjin"" was played and his relationship with the Portuguese captain was a bit underdeveloped. But that is simply a personal preference. The acting overall was really, really good. Beating Mifune's Toranaga was hard to imagine for me, but Sanada really delivered a top notch performance.My only grievance would be that the gruesome end of Ishido at the end of the novel is omitted in the series. But that may perhaps be rectified some day.This series is worth every minute of the viewer's time.",8
"Good but could have been so much better","I have not read the book and have not seen the 1980s show, I have no exposure to Japanese culture, so I watched it with an open mind.Overall it's pretty good but I have two complaints: Blackthorn and the ending.Cosmo Jarvis is completely wrong for the role. He has a single facial expression - perplexity. He walks aimlessly from scene to scene, makes dumb decisions and generally acts stupid. He does not appear to learn much except picking up a bit of language, does not improve anything and generally has no impact on anything. After watching the series it crossed my mind that if his character is removed then absolutely nothing would change. Blackthorn is a village idiot with no purpose. Not even a comic relief.The second complaint is the ending. It's a let down in the style of Game of Thrones. They build up the tension in episodes 1-9, and in the 10th they fell flat of the face. Instead of showing the result of Toranaga's plot they tell us bits and pieces of that it's supposed to accomplish. Could not they shoot another two episodes to show how he succeeded? Did they run out of budget?Episode 10 is a total disappointment.",7
"Overrated!","This must be one of the most overrated TV shows ever. Its pace is terribly slow with almost no action. In a TV show with samurai, you expect to have some battles or at least some sword fights. Unfortunately, they are missing here. This period is supposed to be the bloodiest in the history of Japan, and what we get in its 10 hours? Only drama, which after 10 episodes concludes with guess what? Drama.There is so much hype, promotion, and reviews for this show, but if you expect to see samurai, stay away and don't waste your time with this. Definitely, the show is much overrated and there are much better shows deserving your time.",4
"Decent Remake","I am a fan of the old Shogun from 1980 with
Richard Chamberlain , so I enjoy the retelling of the original story big time... So far the story follows quite precisely which is a good thing... The locations are great, the VFX is decent, there is a respect for source material which is good. It is nice that the Japanese actually speak Japanese ... Overall I would suggest watching ""Age of Samurai"" documentary before this as it perfectly sets the scene to understand which period this story covers. The only thing that this show is inferior to the original is the main actor can not replace Richard Chamberlain, nor anybody can replace John Rhys-Davies well enough , those actors were legendary, that is why 1980's version is totally worth a rewatch...",9
"I love the authenticity.","It was refreshing to see a period Japanese drama on Disney+ as a change form the constant mediocre super hero or Star Wars shows put out by Disney studios these days.I loved the authenticity of the costumes, locations and above all casting - especially using all Japanese origin actors for the Japanese characters (unlike Shardlake which did not respect the ethnicity of the English characters). This made the series so much more believable and enthralling and by the end I was really invested in the characters and what happened to them.If you have a VR headset I would recommend watching the series in a virtual cinema with headphones, it is an amazing experience! While Disney does not have its own VR app., the Bigscreen app does support Disney.I won't give away any of the story but just say that Shogun is definitely worth watching! I hope there will be a second series.",10
"Amazing","It's difficult nowadays to have good, not focused on political correctness, history. I'm honestly overwhelmed by this. I just finished it and I adored it. I've learnt a lot from the ancient samurai I knew very little about. It's weird the way it touched me. The battle between the value of life and the value of honour. The certain doom of some characters that you know will die but hope to the last minute because usually on tv shows the characters you like survive. This is not the case. It's almost as if there is a truth behind this story. I've read that the struggle and the war after a certain Taiko died led to a shogunate and it is real. But, even though the characters are not, and it's a remake of a series (I haven't watched) the realness of the mentality and samurai culture is there. I feel like I've been hit by a truck honestly. I will learn more about this time and the lives of the people that lived it.I really enjoyed experiencing something from another culture. This is a fantastic example of how you can have a story about other cultures without having to remove white skinned characters for ""inclusion"" and changing plots to be ""politically correct"".I loved this. Won't forget it anytime soon. Great job FX.",8
"(7.5 / 10) Very Solid, But With A Few Flaws","A darker and slightly faster paced version than we got in 1980.Many things were done very well. Acting, visuals, costume design, screenplay, sets, all very top notch. Most plot and story changes were well done.I appreciated the action scenes added in this version as well, they were extremely well done and I rewatched a couple of them just to appreciate the attention to detail.Without spoiling anything, I do feel a bit let down by the latter half of the show, but it is still pretty good overall with seriously well-done character moments.One minor negative is that I think the show suffers a bit from trying to focus less on the English-speaking characters, it feels less personal than the 1980 rendition by focusing on a wider gamut of characters. That also makes the world feel well fleshed out though.The one major flaw that is unforgivable is the atrocious music. It doesn't fit at all, and it is extremely bleak and repetitive. At many points, it ruins the atmosphere rather than building it.This is especially criminal considering the 1980 rendition had such a beautiful and powerful soundtrack that generated an amazing atmosphere and evoked immense emotion.Because of this, I felt like the 1980 version respected the beauty present in medieval Japan, which is basically absent in this much bleaker take.I genuinely at many points while watching this version, played in my head or hummed the 1980 themes for Japan and Mariko.The new soundtrack is outright offensively bad and generic comparatively.Aside from that, this version of Shogun is genuinely more entertaining and modern than the 1980 version, which was more personal, but also more boring. It also steers clear of wokism almost entirely, which is such a breath of fresh air!Will check back in a decade and see if anyone has made a fan-edit to fix the music! :)",9
"Portugal","I love this serie, but it was a great mistake that the ""portuguese"" people are really portuguese actors and they don't speak Portuguese, they speak English and make no sense at all, and you lost in middle of the serie what really language they are talking a great mess. Another negative thing was make the Japanese people a crazy suicidal persons that they herselfs for thing with no importance.It's because of this that I don't give a 10/10By the way I am portuguese and I have proud of our historyIf you don't know our history go check something and learn about our extraordinary history, thank you.",10
"Masterpiece","I feel respect for Japanese culture and for their history. Sanada is a great actor. Honorable in every movie he made, Scorpion, Wolverine, John Wick, etc. It's a pleasure to watch him because he represent honor in every role.The music, the intro, the places, the shooting during different weather scenarios. All was just perfect. I believe this was very meticulous. They take care of every details, even when the earthquake hits the village and causes all the damaged.Every actor did their part very well. I look at the series and for a while i was thinking about The Game of Thrones.I recommend it.",10
"Admirable but not enough","This new adaptation of my favorite series since childhood was truly great. But 10 episodes were too few and I think the story should continue. I'm very sorry that the producers ended the story so unpleasantly. I grew up with the nickname Toronaga ,Anjinsan since I was 7 years old. I think these heroes deserve more episodes. I still don't understand why it had such an unsatisfying ending. Especially in the last episode, I saw an effort to end the series hastily. I think it overshadowed the success of the series. .This series deserved more than dozens of TV series with 3-5 seasons. Please, the producers should think again about this issue. Still, I think this story is worth watching anyway.",8
"A Great Period Drama","I really enjoyed this mini series and even though it was not the action packed show that I was expecting, I managed to find value within this dramatic tale of loyalty, deception and subterfuge within one of the many warring periods of Japan's history. The Sengoku era of conflict felt like a solid ground to set the tale in that centered around a shipwrecked England native who has to adapt and learn the Japanese customs to survive. And not all is as it seems with plotting and conniving threads transpiring in the background that keep you guessing from one moment to the next. The best way I can describe Shogun is Game of Thrones meets The Last Samurai with a focus on a last effort by a doomed Japanese samurai clan to make one final push to sieze power and control while a foreigner is learning their ways and trying their best to survive and rise to station within their land. There's some heavy hitting performances too by the cast and a slew of moments where you're on the edge of your seat, especially in the last few episodes. Lastly, while it does not possess a heavy focus on action like some other Samurai movies, it makes up for it with its cunning and witty dialogue, a-la Game of Thrones. Overall, if you're looking for a smart, well versed, evenly paced historical period drama with a somber yet satisfying bittersweet tone and appreciate the rich, lush Japanese culture then you'll be right at home with this one.",9
"After watching this one, we all need to perform Seppuku...","For me, and before reading a lot of material about this series, this show was a way of reaching out (at the second time in a small period of time, after the end of ""Blue Eye Samurai"") to Japanese audience and a way to narrow the gaps with the rest of the world. From side, as a viewer - it's a big success. Without even starting to talk about the rest.Exactly as ""Anjin"" Blackthorne discovers and understand, finally, the beauty and meaning of Japanese tradition - so do we, as an audience and as a fly in the woods. All of the viewers reacted with a big shock to each and every suggestion of performing self-suicide, that is named: Seppuku or Harakiri (which is not used or mentioned at all in the series), but as the time passes by, it didn't seem so weird or unreasonable, just frustrating, in a way we've managed to contain.So many characters and such amazing and accurate development arcs for all the meaningful part of the cast. The main characters got us attached to them, like flies to crap, despite cultural differences. The main plot was branched into two main and major storylines, which built themselves from each and every side. Every episode and every detail were made with a strict eye, great care and notification for each and every small detail you can possibly imagine.As I haven't read the book or seen any content that is related to it, from years before, this experience was pretty new and fresh. I understand that the series is minimizing the view of Blackthorne and the western point of view and gives the stage to the Japanese culture and customs, so it was much more appreciated for its authenticity and almost 80% of the occurrence in this series is in the Japanese Language.Each and every custom gets magnified ten times then can be expected and the drill down to this unique and different culture gets its chunk of the series' runtime. It was an experience that got us to think and adapt to customs we are not familiar to, as was Blackthorne, with his stages of learning that he is not that smart, at the end of all things and the last episodes twists were silent and not bombastic, but surprising and sneaky - exactly as Yoshii Toranaga planned them to role.This series revealed some not very familiar actors and actresses to the world. Names like Cosmo Jarvis, Anna Sawai and especially Tadanobu Asano will never be able to get back to anonymity, as their performances were delightful. Hiroyuki Sanada was one of the little few that was recognized, but his performance enhanced his popularity and everything we've ever thought about him, as an actor for small and forgettable roles.One can hope that this series will not continue to a second season, though the ending was pretty demanding a sequel. Good things need to know when to end, before they get to spoil due to fans service, as we've seen at other TV shows that didn't know when it is the time to wrap things up. It was one season almost perfect experience and one of the better things' TV medium has given to its audience.",8
"7 episodes in and nothings actually happened !","Began with promise, and appeared to be heading in to the story similar to ""the last samurai"". Sadly however by the end of episode four and as each hour dragged on of the show it became evident that there was little development of the storyline and series. People talking, someone's getting impeached, people shouting, more talking, bit of travelling somewhere, more talking, listen to the rain, 7 hours later, still nothing has really happened. It's just so incredibly boring it nearly put me to sleep. Story feels like it's so slow, the story will come to a stand still. Can't believe this had a 9/10 rating originally ! The food news is it's beautifully shot and has nice music to it.",3
"Very boring","Show has an interesting setting and premise, however after the first 3 episodes it really started dragging itself along at an extremely boring pace. Lots of drama for basically no reason, not much progression and NO BATTLES after hyping up to a war for several episodes.When I started watching the show, I would describe it as Japanese GoT (I know it's based on a book, but that is kind of the premise sold to the uninformed Disney+ watcher). But compared to GoT, nothing happens to keep me really invested.The set design and costumes are awesome, as are the very few fight scenes (save for the latest one in ep 9 where everything is pitch black if you don't have a fancy OLED tv).",8
"Almost Perfect, Almost Shogun","Shogun immediately sinks its hooks into you. Right from the get go the show nails almost all aspects. The production design is not only grand in scale showcasing the sweeping vistas and landscapes of Japan. It simultaneously gets all the little details correct as well. The acting is top notch. And it establishes a compelling narrative of an outsider thrust into the life and death politics of Japan. However as the show goes on it starts to lose steam. The show spends so much time building stakes and tension all just to fizzle out and abruptly end. I do not want an allusion to an ending I want to see it. That is the cardinal sin of this show.",9
"When the language doesn't let you be rated 10 stars","This series is like that studious student who had everything he needed to get a brilliant 10 stars but makes a mistake on the easiest question.Everything in this series is good: photography, direction, art, scenery, clothes, acting, etc. Everything. The producers only failed in one thing: ENGLISH IS NOT PORTUGUESE!I speak Portuguese, but I was watching it in the original languages, Japanese + English, when suddenly, someone said ""hey, do you speak Portuguese? Yes, I do"" and both characters continued in... ENGLISH! WTF?!That was one of the weirdest things I've ever seen! In my entire life!!!I've read somewhere that the producers preferred to leave the lines in English for convenience, and due to the difficulty of teaching the language or finding Portuguese speakers. Ok. So why 'pretend' they are speaking Portuguese? WHY!?All they had to do was come up with an excuse to change the language to English as Blackthorne is from... England! That would justify. And that would be fair.There was no need to make the public look like idiots.A simple sentence from Blackthorne would solve everything:
'LOOK, MY PORTUGUESE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH, CAN WE SPEAK IN ENGLISH?'Just that way!And the series would have a maximum rating: 10!Well, as I speak Portuguese, from the 3rd chapter onwards I simply stopped listening to the original English sound and started watching it dubbed in Portuguese. It was horrible, but at least I didn't feel cheated.",8
"Not as smart as you might think","The shows politics had no real pay off and none of it felt that smart either. I really enjoyed this show up to about episode 8 until I realized ""thats it?"". Im not expecting some big finale, but the result of it all didn't feel earned either.Also why is John blackthorne a bumbling annoying idiot the whole show? He had almost no synergy with any characters except yabushige and everytime he got himself out of a bad situation it didn't feel earned at all. I think thats my biggest issue with this show as a whole, a lot of the results don't feel earned. Theres been a lot of comparisons of this show to GOT, but the one thing GOT did was the politics and outcomes always felt thought out and earned. In Shogun things happen for the sake of the outcome.Like I said, Shogun was really good until episode 8 and then it kind of fell on its face.",9
"Fantastic show brought down only by one thing...","The show is beautifully shot and the story is very compelling. The Japanese cast includes some truly heavy hitters (Hiroyuki Sanada and Tadanobu Asano are legends, imo).The only thing that brings it down slightly for me is the terrible, hammy overacting of Cosmo Jarvis. I don't know if it's the script that was written for him or what, but his performance just comes off as so...unwatchable. It's like he's trying to do a third-rate channeling of Tom Hardy (who by the way would have been fantastic in this role, in my opinion). Every time Blackthorne opens his mouth I just want to cringe.Shogun is still very much worth watching because thankfully, Blackthorne is just one small part of an otherwise excellent ensemble cast. This show runs laps around ""House of the Dragon"" or any other recent period limited drama.",8
"Great Build up, great build up - all to... not much.","I watched the show as each episode came out and let me tell you straight away - everything LOOKS AMAZING. The visuals, the sets, the costumes...etc. It immerses you in this world perfectly.Now for the story:
The characters are fantastic, Torango, Markio, Blackthorne and all of them are played fantastically. I love the cunning of Torango and the Game of Thrones style he brings to the table. There is HOWEVER ONE ISSUE: I wish the other characters in the show were more competent - the Council of Regents, the Taiko's mother. All act smart but in reality are nothing compared to Torango. This gives a more
one-sided feel unlike Game of Thrones.Now for the BIGGEST issue: the final peak of the show was a letdown. While I somewhat understand they may have been going for some Game of Thrones Ned Stark death at end of Season 1, this just did not have the same stakes. War seemed inevitable so why the sudden change of heart? This confused me and therefore led to a relatively anti climatic ending. All the build up of war for what? A sudden twist that Toranga was planning something different? While this twist may work to an extent, the amount we were led on as the viewer was too great not to comply with a battle of some sorts at the end! This is why I have degraded my opinion of the show from a 10 to an 8. Shame there isn't any more seasons.",10
"Best Historical Drama Of The Past Decade","Shogun is easily the best historical drama series to come out in the past decade, if not longer. It sticks to the source material, and beautifully combines history, intrigue, and culture. The best thing about the show is by far the writing, something that cannot be said for most movies and shows coming out of modern Hollywood. The characters all have great character development, and although there is a lot going on, it just works, for lack of better words. The cinematography is phenomenal, and the costume design is on point to say the least. In addition to this, the attention given to historical details is very admirable. The show focuses on the traditions, cultural norms, and beliefs of feudal Japan, rather than taking an anachronistic approach to the time period. There is a clear focus on the importance of honor, loyalty, and respect, and its importance is reflected in this show. This show is fascinating, and in my opinion, it deserves to be considered one of the best shows in cinema history.",10
"Liable to be the best series of 2024","A monumental TV series. Beautifully shot, superbly acted, a compelling plot, and blissfully free of the rampant identity politics agenda that is ruining so many shows and movies nowadays.The characters are excellent and very well cast. As a viewer, it's easy to invest in them. The female characters display great strength and fortitude without abrasively losing their femininity - Hollywood should take note of that.The storyline is heavy with political intrigue and Machiavellian maneuvering. In that respect it's reminiscent of the best moments of Game of Thrones. The action scenes are brutally realistic, but also portray the bravery and honour that results from a strict warrior code.The historical and cultural depictions seem accurate; and it really is a wonderous window into the samurai era. However, the show doesn't glamorise or fantasize; nor is it judgemental. The socio-cultural differences between East and West are clearly contrasted through the perspectives and actions of the English character.This is a 'must see' series. I have sincerely relished every episode.",9
"Spectacular & Epic Storytelling","This is more like 10 short movies rather than a television series. Beautifully filmed in some stunning scenery. Japan is a very beautiful country on the small or big screen.I can vaguely remember the original television series when I was growing up but I can't recall if it was actually any good. This version of the same book is a bit of a slow burner and yes there are subtitles. Lots of subtitles. I guess 90% of the dialogue is Japanese which is great for and obviously authentic but be warned you will be reading quite a lot of dialogue.No plot spoilers here so you'll just have to go and watch it for yourself. If you like films like The Last Samurai or The Seven Samurai then I think you'll love this. Epic storytelling for the small screen at its very best.",3
"Cheated, started amazing, then went nowhere!","The quality of the filming and acting was brilliant! I love John Blackthorne, a very well played character and fun to watch. The whole series had me gripped and waiting for the next episode, so many story lines building in excitement and ""what next?""Well, as I went on and approached the 10th episode, I realised, errrrrrr I am not sure there is a ""what next"". The main character surrenders, the daughter kills herself, nobody is held accountable.JB starts to train his regiments to use British canons which were super accurate, were they used in battle, NO!JB's ship was sunk by sabators, so we never saw him get back in his ship and attack! The series kept eluding to JB getting his ship back and attacking the Catholics! Nope, not even close.Then in episode 10 the last 15 minutes, the main character explains it all, in talk, not in scenes, oh no, just a summary in talking nonsense and then executes his friend! WTH!?There is no big battle, there is no over throwing of a corrupt government, no action, no big battles. Just lots of bowing and sitting on mats and talking nonsense. Apparently a flower is only a flower because it falls, who knew, and something about a branch with no leaves.Gutted I wasted my time watching this pap! I started 9/10, by the end it barely scraped a 3/10. Don't waste your time, unless you are into weird poetry and lots of scenes of people sat on the floor staring at each other, oh and a lot bowing!",8
"Another good series with a bad ending","While I have a favorable view of Shogun, I think the creators badly stubbed their toe in the finale. Here are my thoughts:
1) It was a bit deflating to realize that the ""crimson sky"", the Erasmus, and yes, the cannons had all been red herrings. There was an anti-climactic quality about the ending.2) I had built Toranaga up to be a wise Solomonic figure. How disappointing to find out that he was a sociopathic character who had readily sacrificed his friend Hiromatsu, his trusted aide Mariko, and an entire village to further his ends.3) The worst aspect of the finale was the way that it shrunk the character of John Blackthorne, turning him into a small, beaten, pathetic figure. The show went out of its way to have Toranaga diss him, saying that he kept the Anjin around only as an amusing little mascot. And if that wasn't enough, they drove home the fact that he would never be allowed to go back to England. Why they went out of their way to belittle Blackthorne is beyond me, since William Adams, the real life Blackthorne, went on to be a an eminent figure in Japan and achieved the status of samurai.4) Overall, rather than play up anything uplifting, the finale served as a buzz kill. It could've focused on the respect that Blackthorne had earned from the Japanese, and hinted at the grand future he would have in Asia. Just as episode 9 could have lingered more on passion and romance of the last night between Mariko and the Anjin. Instead, it gave short shrift to both, and played up the nihilism of the power-hungry Toranaga. Episode 10 was a surprising downer.And while I enjoyed the series, if someone said to me today, ""Did you hear? They're making a second season of Shogun."" I would say, ""No thanks, been there, done that.""",10
"Finally A Show Worth Watching","This is the best show I've seen in a long time.The first two episodes are excellent and I'm really hoping the rest of the episodes are as good as this .I was too young to watch the original series but it always looked very appealing to me .I'm so glad they made this one .There are some super performances in the show but the stand outs to me are Hiroyuki Sanada as Lord Yoshi and Anna Sawai as Lady Mariko.Lady Mariko is clearly going to be an important character going forward in the story .NÃ©stor Carbonell Is also a strong performer as Vaso Rodrigues and I had to look up to see who he was as his appearance is so different.I'm really looking forward to the next instalment.",10
"Yep. This is what great entertainment and great storytelling are supposed to be like.","I watched the 1980's tv series as a teenager in the 1980's and remember being captivated by the show then. This latest Disney series, of some 44 years later, is vastly superior as you'd except for the industry improvements, budgets, craft skills and resources available these days. But on top of that, this show is ... just beautiful. Beautiful acting, beautiful sets, beautiful dialogue, beautiful writing and script work, beautiful timing and pacing, beautiful pre-production, beautiful art department work, beautiful post production, beautiful directing, producing, editing, score, sound-track, costuming and on and on and on. Absolutely perfect. Yes please. Lots and lots more shows just like this. This one is the meter and measure for all the rest. No excuses! By-the-way, I know from the 1980's series there's more to this story. Will there be any more series for Shogun? Part of me would want to read the book, but wouldn't want to ... prejudice my enjoyment of any more of this tv series ...",10
"Glorious","I was excited after seeing first trailer - one of my favourite historical fiction stories getting another take after 40 years. Half way through the season and I think this is one of the best (if not THE best) historical shows I've ever seen. Sure, it is an adaptation but still: writing and dialogs are fantastic, costumes and scenohgraphy 11 out of 10 and I can't praise all actors enough. Attention to detail is unparalleled. Some scenes represent mastery of indirect storytelling, conveying more through minute facial expressions, composition, light and subtle music than lines of exposition. There is so much average TV fast food served on all platforms but this is something special. This show sets a new bar for historical accuracy and authenticity and I hope it gets all recognition it deserves.",10
"Top notch so far","So the first two episodes have introduced us to many of the characters and set up for the intricate plot. Looks like latter episodes will have the bulk of the action. Tremendous sets, costumes and scenery are giving this a lot of authenticity. Coincidentally for me Sanada ( who almost always elevates anything he's in ) is my current favorite Japanese actor and Toshiro Mifune who played the same character in the 80's version was my favorite Japanese actor then. The actress playing Mariko is doing a much better job than she did in Monarch. As for the Blackthorne actor and character I too like others found his voice off putting but now I'm used to it. I kept trying to figure who he sounded like and then realized he sounds ( as the character ) like Richard Burton who I saw in a movie the other day. His character also began as unlikable and arrogant but am now beginning to like more. I hope this wins many awards and am eagerly looking forward to the rest of the series. The subtitles do not bother me as I'm an avid reader and watch all shows and movies with subtitles anyway so I never miss any dialogue. It gets one less star because I thought the two eps could have used a bit more intensity but I'm sure that will be rectified soon enough.",10
"A true masterpiece!","FX's 'Shogun' is a triumph of epic television, seamlessly blending meticulous attention to historical detail with gripping storytelling and powerhouse performances. From its immaculate mise en scene to its complex characters and wild plotting, every aspect of the series exudes excellence. Anchored by standout performances from Anna Sawai and Hiroyuki Sanada, the show navigates the intricate webs of power, diplomacy, and betrayal in feudal Japan with both grace and intensity. It's a visually spectacular journey that immerses viewers in a world of rich cultural traditions and fierce political intrigue. 'Shogun' strikes a perfect balance between jaw-dropping spectacles and intimate character moments, offering a compelling exploration of themes that resonate deeply with audiences. In an era saturated with content, 'Shogun' stands out as a true masterpiece, captivating viewers with its grandeur, depth, and timeless storytelling.",8
"Beautiful yet lacking authenticity","Excellent show, beautiful music, outstanding acting, scenery and camera work.But it's not a proper tribute or nowhere near any of Clavell's novels.His novels are an idealization (and devaluation) of Japanese culture and Bushido centering around death as the ultimate honor.The writers completely missed the essence of Clavell's writings.Which is that James was utterly broken as POW in Japanese captivity.during WW2 and adapted to a dog-like existence to survive.Shogun, his other novels (King Rat) are autobiographical.and a testament to the horrors inflicted on POWs and by no means an accurate representation of Japanese culture as a whole.Or maybe it was, considering loyal and dutiful Japanese soldiers were found decades after Hirohito surrendered.The show absolutely undershot the story and failed to portray Clavell's last grasp of humanity rightfully, the romance, friendship and love between Blackthorne and Mariko; features that Clavell never experienced in Japanese culture in his lifetime.It's this, or his, depiction of duty vs. Humanity which I sorely missed.Because any fan of Clavell's novels will ultimately be left with a feeling of great sorrow towards James Clavell himself.A great writer indeed.",6
"Why is this show rated so highly","I am a big history buff, so I was looking forward to a grand epic about Tokugawa Ieyasu and his rise to absolute power.I liked it, but it is definitely not a 9/10 show imo.The main character stood out, in a bad way. All the other actors were good to great even, except for the main character. I don't get it.This might just be me, but I am so tired of the clichÃ© point of view character in these ""exotic"" settings.He's just a boring white guy with zero character and was completely unnecessary for the story. I want to see the story of the feudal Japanese doing their feudal Japanese stuff, having a European as a main character is so condescending, both towards the audience as the actual people who this series was based on.Yes, I know the character of the Englishman is also based upon a real person, but he was not a main player in the whole Tokugawa drama as far I know.The show does so much to contrast Japanese and western culture, and so little in explaining the actual political situation, which annoys me, because I think that's the whole point of this history. And in my opinion, it was often very forced and clichÃ©.The way the show focuses on the extreme honor system, seppuku and death in general, seems quite gratuitous to me. I might be wrong, but more then once I felt the writers were going for shock value and nothing else.And the main reason for my low score: you make a big budget, high production tv show about Tokugawa, and no great battle? They show 30 seconds of armies facing each other, what on earth were the writers thinking? Talk about blue balls.If you can't do the big battle, don't make a historical show that is based on a huge war that ended in the biggest samurai battle of all time. That's just my opinion. Disappointing.Overall, if you like historical shows, I still recommend it. The story is okay, all the other actors were very good, even though the ending fell a bit flat for me.",5
"Overrated big time","There are small parts of it that I liked. But very few. The pace is very uneven. All Japanese actors are fantastic and believable- doing the best with what they are given. There are two main issues. First - the writing is atrocious, formulaic, overly simplified and incoherent. The 2nd issue is the way Blackthorn character is written. He is neither the English gentleman nor the simpleton. Writers can't decide, and because of that his actions and words do not make sense most of the time and it is frustrating. Overall - overrated by about 3 points. Only 6/10 really. Watch 'The Last Samurai' Instead. A very similar story but well written, cohesive and overall a much better quality.",9
"5 Episodes in and its Samurai High brow heaven","Very pleased with this show so far. Seems to pay homage to the source material. And is beautiful to watch.Casting seems great, costumes superb, little SFX used also brilliant. Feudal Japanese seems incredibly realistic as much as it is complex. All the leads including the son are great actors. I wish I had read the book rather than watched the Richard Chamberlain series many moons ago. BUT so far, so excellent.Its probably gonna get some unfair comparisons to GoT but so what, yes its poltiical and yes its similar, but its just brilliant masterclass writing of West meets East with plenty of historical flair.I really hope you enjoy it as much as I am right now. X. And I hope I can read some material on any mistakes on the Japanese Feudal era as its quite captivating coming from a Westerners point of view.Nevertheless I am really enjoying this historical drama.",8
"Shogun is extremely well made when it comes to everything. A bit disappointed about the ending though.","I haven't read the book or seen any other Shogun from 1980. I like Hiroyuki Sanada, and saw that he was in it, and saw that it had a very good rating on IMDB, so I gave it a shot. And after watching it I can say that it most definitely deserves the rating it has.Shogun is extremely well made when it comes to everything. Acting, character development, story, scenery, lighting, the score, direction, script and dialogue, just everything basically.At first I had a hard time forming a bond with John Blackthorne, but that started to change in about episode 3 or 4. He really is a changed man if you compare how he was in the first episode compared to the last. A total 180. Mariko, Yabushige and Toranaga were also very interesting characters.Shogun has a very good ending. Both episodes 9 and 10. I didn't see that twist coming. Personally, I think the series could have increased the pacing a little bit more halfway through the season. I would have liked to see that the events in episode 9 with Mariko and Crimson Sky to have happened in episode 8 instead, and what happened in episode 10 could have been episode 9, and then in the last episode I would have liked to see the war that is talked about throughout the series. I think it was a good ending, but at the same time I was disappointed that I didn't get to see a little more action.At the end, you realize how emotionless and power-mad Toranaga actually is. The ruthless plan he had all along, not caring about anyone but himself to become Shogun. In the last episode, I also wanted to see the aftermath and how John Blackthorne reacts when he discovers the truth about Toranaga. It would have been epic. But all of this could easily happen if there is a season 2!",9
"Great television and an epic historical drama","I loved Shogun. Set in seventeenth-century Japan, an English Protestant, John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis) seeks to disrupt the Portuguese trade and the Catholic Church and finds himself the adjutant to Japanese lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada) who is seeking to avoid open warfare among competing warlords. New Zealand-born actor, Anna Sawai shines as Lady Mariko, a Catholic convert and translator.I devoured the novel (by James Clavell) in my teens and still have a nice first edition copy of the book with the original dust cover. I also have a vague memory of the 70s TV series with Richard Chamberlain in the Blackthorne role. This series is saved from a 'white saviour' complex by being almost entirely in the Japanese language, and keeping Blackthorne in an ineffective role in which he is constantly at sea (no pun intended) trying to negotiate the complexities of Japanese culture.There's a wonderful scene where Lady Mariko is explaining to Blackthorne the temporary nature of existence. We live, we die, we can't expect to live forever. Honour is everything. Suddenly an earthquake hits, underscoring the fragility and temporality of life. The final episode may appear something of a letdown as the story appears to be building toward one great decisive military assault but it plays out differently. The penultimate episode is the real highlight as Lady Mariko confronts her captors in Osaka and her fate is determined.Everything about the series is top rate - the writing, the acting, the direction, the sets and the costumes. Reminiscent of Akira Kurisawa's Ran (1985), though that film is set a couple of hundred years earlier, it brilliantly evokes feudal Japan and its early engagement with the west. Shogun is great television and highly recommended.",8
"Good Remake!","Thoroughly enjoyed the original version with Richard Chamberlain back in the day. Read the book at that time, too, which was fantastic. And, this latest remake stands out as well. However, found Cosmo Jarvis' somewhat lumbering gait a bit more befitting the Japanese moniker ""barbarian"" in contrast to Chamberlain's more stately Englishman. Perhaps, a longer reunion sequence with his crew might have demonstrated just how much he had changed and become repulsed by the crude ways of his past. Nonetheless, excellent series, good acting. Hated to see it end, but suspect it will do well come award season.",8
"Really good, except ...","I really enjoyed Season 1 of this show. I think it a modern and wonderfully dark depiction of the original material of Clavell and especially liked the thoughtful pacing which allowed for so much attention to detail. The performances of Mariko and Toranaga are outstandig. Although I had some difficulty with the subtitled Japanese in the beginning, after getting used to it I thought it was adding to the authenic feeling altogether. I am already looking forward to a contiuation of the show. This said, however, there are also reasons why this is not a 10/10 for me. I did not at all like the performance of Cosmo Jarvis - I don't know, he gives me the impression as if he unsuccessfully tries hard to immitate Tom Hardy in Taboo while - sorry to say -displaying the intelligence of a gold fish. Also, for me, he fails to transport any chemistry between John and Mariko.",3
"Mesmerizing!","The storytelling, photography, direction, characters (supposedly based on real life historical figures) that are seamlessly woven into this tale of political intrigue, combine to create a show that is immaculate. Just two episodes in, I am dying to watch the next episode which will be excrutiatingly dropped one at a time. Every week!Was already a fan of Hiroyuki Sanada after watching him play the heroic Ujio in The Last Samurai. I was elated when he was cast. The British actor I hadn't seen before but he's excellent. And I am learning a lot about the history of the far east. I hadn't known about the involvement of the Portuguese in there.More of the same please! My mind is blown...",10
"A great adaptation and a must watch for both book readers and newcomers","Shogun captivates audiences with its masterful blend of historical drama, intrigue, and stunning cinematography. Set against the backdrop of feudal Japan, the series transports viewers to a richly detailed world filled with samurai honor, political maneuvering, and cultural clashes. The character development is superb, with each actor delivering nuanced performances that bring depth and authenticity to their roles while keeping true to the source material with minor adjustments to dialogue that don't hurt the original narrative significantly. From the intense battles to the intimate moments, Shogun keeps you on the edge of their seats, effortlessly weaving together action, suspense, and emotion simultaneously to shows like game of thrones or breaking bad at their best. With its compelling storyline and meticulous attention to historical detail, Shogun's a must-watch for anyone craving an immersive journey into Japan's captivating past exploring Japanese politics of the time as well as how the European Protestant and Catholic feud at the time effected politics in the region.",10
"Immersive Storytelling!","5 episodes in, and this is one of the most immersive seasons I have seen in a long time. Not since early episodes of GoT have I been so truly and fully immersed in the story of a season due to exceptional world-building.The creative staff of this season has gone to great lengths to stay true to the Japanese culture of the time - be it customs, costumes, and even language. The majority of the dialogue of this show is in Japanese and it adds to the richness of the whole setting. Additionally, the Japanese cast bring in much needed native flair to the screen with powerful performances.Experiencing this season as a labor of love that stays true to the source material is a breath of fresh air in the banality that is current TV.",9
"Big promise; little reward","I was really looking forward to this series. I read the book when it first came out (at LEAST twice), and I must have watched the 1980's mini-series, though I have no memory of it. I watched the current series but I am giving it two stars, and that for the production values only. It's much tooTooTOO much ado about nothing. It's basically about internal Japanese politics, and it's just not very interesting and no one enjoys history more than I do. The grafted-on love story is unconvincing. The actor playing Blackthorne is totally lacking in charisma: I could care less about him. The actress playing Mariko is so wooden and emotionless that there's nothing to hang on to. I suppose that she made an artistic choice to represent Japanese women of that time and social class as stoic and internalizing all emotion but it doesn't work in what is supposed to be an enthralling drama. I waited until all ten episodes were shown with the intention of doing a modified binge-watch of one episode a night. But I found myself in the middle of the third ep saying ""I don't care for this"" and the show-a-night for ten nights stretched out, because it seemed such a chore to put the time and effort in. I watched episode five and I finally decided that that was enough. I broke my cardinal rule and read reviews before I finished the whole series. I must say that the negative reviews really nailed it. What were the positive reviewers watching? I'm giving up and deleting the rest of it.",2
"Excellent thus far. Great cast, cinematography, and wardrobe.","Hard to go wrong with a great story by James Clavell as foundation and thus far the cast performances, cinematography, and wardrobe are wonderful.I will not be surprised if this series takes its share of awards. Anna Sawai, Hiroyuki Sanada, Takehiro Hira, Neator Carbonell, Tadanobu Asano, and the rest of the cast have hit it out of the park.I can't wait for more episodes and no doubt more captivating performances.Recently watched the entire original series with Toshiro Mifune, Richard Chamberlain and Yoko Shimada and respective cast. A must watch as well, no doubt this will also be fantastic.",10
"Beutifull","Great cinematography paired with brilliant scrip writing makes this a instantaneous classic that I definitely recommend watching.The story is clearly written with the intent of creating a series worth watching and not just another ""cash grab"". This is furthered when we move past the ""introductory"" sequence in the first episode and get in to the actual action that this series serves us.It is also important to note how historically accurate this series is, which is extremely impressive considering the high quality that is upheld throughout this entire project.To summarize, this series is definitely worth watching if you have any interest at all in Japanese history!",10
"Intriguing!","This was the most intriguing tv series for 2024! Didn't watch original one or read book but can say it depicts the discipline/bushido code accurately . The natural disaster like earthquake has been shown too . Was fan of GOT for political tension , trickery but Shogun is going to replacing that since it looks real and some of the plots matches with history. Hiroyuki Sanada is excellent as usual like he performed in Westworld .And Cosmo Jarvis gets my attention , I am going to watch his other works too. Anna Sawai is delivering very good acting . Thank you Team Shogun for excellent entertainment!",9
"Samurai game of thrones","If you haven't already. Watch the first episode. The production value alone will get you hooked.So many stories to follow. So many characters to love and to hate and to root for or boo at.It's been a while since I've watched something from the fresh start of its inception, and had to wait a week for the next episode. The wait is always worth it. Its shocking, its funny, it's sad and courageous. The team of writers are on point at keeping you guessing what's going to happen!? Who is that!? What are they going to do!?The cinematography and sets/visuals are beautifully stunning. They have captured a real and wild Japan both in the cities and the countryside, the towns, the buildings, the savagery and the beauty. At times it can be brutally harsh then in an instant vulnerable and soft.If you don't like subtitles at least give it a try. Mainly spoken of Japanese, there are moments of English, though in reality they are supposed to be speaking Portuguese.Disney. You've finally done something good. But I think it was actually FX.",9
"Fantastic show otherwise","I like the show so far, but it's slow moving. Most of the characters are fascinating, The atmosphere, characters, traditions are very well presented which inspired, language is lapses in almost all the episodes, I place it on 8 because I found some loose ends like the story line, mixed-up issues which didn't support the story at all. It must be an action drama but action is lacking as whole.Overall the show is great, costumes, tradition and many more enjoyably moments in the season. The genre is good but action leads the show of all time while it's missing, hope we will enjoy it in the next season.",8
"A respectable adaptation of the classic story","The 2024 series ""Shogun"" offers a respectable adaptation of the classic story, with a cast that delivers solid performances. The actors bring a level of authenticity to their roles, effectively portraying the historical and cultural backdrop of feudal Japan.This iteration of ""Shogun"" introduces subtle updates to the storyline, making it accessible to a modern audience while maintaining the integrity of the original plot. The show manages to strike a balance between honoring its source material and incorporating contemporary sensibilities.With good production quality and careful attention to historical detail, the show provides an enjoyable viewing experience. It's a commendable effort that will likely appeal to those who appreciate historical dramas, as well as those discovering ""Shogun"" for the first time.Overall, ""Shogun"" is a worthy watch, showcasing a story that continues to have relevance and appeal, supported by a dedicated team both in front of and behind the camera.",9
"Calvikastimes needs to read more.","Saying a series based on a novel that long predates Game of Thrones a copy demonstrates an opinion of low culture and intellect. The show he references showed gratuitous everything to satisfy people of juvenile low attention spans. This is an intelligent series with history and depth, not dependent on cheap tricks. It believes in the intelligence of the viewer. This is a beautifully made series with a wealth of culture that doesn't need to be fabricated. The plotting, the politics, the action, they all have a more layered meaning. I'm really looking forward to seeing how this all unfolds. People should appreciate quality shows like this when they grace us with their presence.",10
"Gave it a 10 after the first 2 episodes now it's a 2.","This show had so much potential. The previews made it seem like it was full of action but you continue to wait for more action. Some episodes are absolutely boring and just when you think the action is coming it doesn't. It builds up to a final showdown for the series finale and then guess what it doesn't come. Final episode is probably the most boring of the entire show. The storyline is great and the potential was there to be one of the greatest samurai shows or movies ever made but it disappointed. I thought the ending was going to be something like we saw on The Last Samurai but it wasn't. If you looking for a show that is a Drama show with a little action then go for it. But if you want a lot of action pass on it.",2
"This is perfection","When I was young, I read the book and watched the TV series, I loved both and forgot about it as I grew older. But then now i binged watched the whole series from Starz, who I thought peaked with Ash versus the evil dead, I was amazed and blown away from this adaptation.Don't be fooled, just because it's screening on Disney, their filthy muddling hands have not from what I've seen had any impact in the creation of this magnificent show.Is it faithful to the novel? Well more no to yes.. the novel is massively expansive and wouldn't have been able to be put all into season 1. But it does a very brilliant adaptation neverless. The acting here on show is A1 brilliance, not one actor is bad, the sets are beautiful and rich and the costumes beyond beautiful. The scriptwriting and directions are on point and I cannot say enough on how beautiful this show is to watch.",10
"Shogun could become the new GoT","After 9 episodes, it has become clear to me. Shogun is the best series currently appearing on streaming services and one of the best shows ever made. Shogun has managed to create an alive world, amazing characters and a story that rivals the early seasons of Game of Thrones.... in just ONE season. Every dialogue is intense, tells you a lot about each characterÂ´s motivations and the strange world they live in. You have to pay attention at all times, otherwise you wonÂ´t know whats happening in the next scene. The series demands you to pay attention and doesnÂ´t think its audience is stupid. I found the subtitles a bit strange at the beginning, but now i actually love them. They let you connect more with this strange and different society. An english dub would have probably made this series worse as weird as that sounds. The cinematography, cgi and sets are among the best in the industry. The action scenes are well coreographed, (fun fact: they used real and sharp swords on set!) and seem brutal and realistic. After 9 episodes I have barely anything bad to say about the series. Please recommend this series to your friends and family, so we might get a second season! This show definitely deserves it!",10
"Superb!","I've been a fan of the book for years. I lost count of the number of times I read it. I didn't think it was possible for a television version to faithfully capture the depth of the story, but this show succeeded brilliantly! The acting, sets, and costumes all were excellent. But best of all, James Clavell's rich, complex story was faithfully captured.Yes, there were changes, but they did not take away from the plot or feel of the story. I'm not sure, but some of them may have been corrections in some of the book's inaccuracies. I know the book did contain some historical errors. So when I saw that some of the characters' names were changed a bit, I have to wonder if that was a correction, as I cannot imagine any other reason for doing so. (For example, Kashigi Yabushige in the show was Kasigi Yabu in the novel.)The show lost some detail and subplots, which is understandable considering that my hardcover edition of the novel is 1100 pages. (That's not a typo; it's 1100 pages and split into two volumes.)There is a good deal of violence and strong language, but all of it is germane to the story.I was pleased to see that Clavell's daughter Michaela served as one of the producers.I cannot recommend Shogun enough! It is an excellent production of an excellent novel! Watch this series and then go read the novel.",10
"Beautiful and rich in Japanese Culture.","Shogun stands out as a rare gem in today's television landscape. Gone are the days of sprawling epics that delve deeply into a foreign culture. This series is a magnificent exception, weaving a masterful narrative rich in the tapestry of Japanese customs and traditions. It's not just about sword fights (though there are some!), but rather a captivating exploration of leadership, loyalty, and the intricate dance between those who rule and those who serve. Be prepared to be surprised by the lengths some will go to in the pursuit of power and the unwavering dedication of others. If you crave a show that goes beyond the clash of steel and offers a deeper, more nuanced story, then Shogun is a must-watch.",9
"Don't be put off by them speaking Japanese! It's part of the charm!!","I was a fan of Game of Thrones, I did not like it for its epic battles, cinematic effects and certainly I did not like it for its very poor plot of the last two seasons. I loved the intrigue, the political shifts, the clever (or not so much) strategic moves but mostly I love it for the so well developed characters. Shogun is the same, certain characters make the story gripping. All the Japaneses for sure...the western guy is just there just 'for the ride'. These Japaneses warriors and lords are fascinating. Their traditions, their wonderful wisdom and sense of beauty. If anything, this series is worth watching for the costumes and the beautiful views. (pity is not really filmed in Japan...). The fact they speak in Japanese is not only refreshing, it's also a discovery of a wonderful language! Sometimes it might sound even animalistic with its grunts, other times it's poetry... Japanese speaking is absolutely half of the charm of this tv series that leaves me enamoured with ancient japan history and eager for more!!!",9
"Best!","I'm seeing all kinds of weird reviews here, some giving it a 1 for not speaking english in the show or for describing a culture which is cruel (compared to our own nowadays western culture). These people don't seem to care about the effort the whole Shogun team has put into bringing to screen that particular culture in the most accurate way possible. Why did you even bother looking at it? And on top of that you dare rate it, you ignorant inglorious b.?! You ever though you might be the ones with a problem because you always want things to ""go your way""?! PS: score from end credits ep.1 is top.",10

"True masterpiece of this year so far!","Caught me right away from the 1st episode. Costumes and scenery are just amazing! The story itself is getting better and better, plus the best way to learn about Japanese culture and disciplines!It is definitely worth watching if you're interested in history of Japan.It is actually reminds me the TV show Marco Polo which was also another great show about Chinese history and culture.I wish there was more of this kind of historical shows so it will some sense of history and definitely takes your mind off of all AI stuff.The cast is incredible!Finally something good to watch and enjoy!!",10
"Good setup turns into comedy","The show starts great. As a viewer we get accustomed to the world through the eyes of a literal outsider, JOHN BLACKTHORNE! The Englishman in Japan. By the second episode things are going smoothly and we start to learn about the tensions between the factions. In the third episode, while decent overall, we start to see the emergence of the true characters behind the names and faces. Mariko comes out as a Mary Sue-sama by being able to pick up a polearm from the ground and beat off soldiers while wearing her kimono. Of course, all of this was initiated by the Trickster Dude Toranaga who hid himself inside a box and almost got everyone killed several times without any real follow-up plan. More tricks coming up!The next couple of episodes we spend seeing JOHN BLACKTHORNE learning the life of ""the Japans"" and white knighting Mariko. You see, his Husbuntaro doesn't allow Mary Sue-sama to commit seppoku. Of course later on, Husbuntaro does allow that, but Mary Sue-sama changes her mind, because it's not the same thing if Husbuntaro is also there to steal her thunder. Anyways, JOHN BLACKTHORNE is there to nod confusedly to Mary Sue-sama's AI generated quotes to make everything better. Also in Osaka, the Villain and his dysfunctional lackeys were plotting on how to impact the plot in any way shape or form.Next up, Trickster Dude Toranaga gets an epic idea! He pretends to surrender, and in fact, does it so well that his son gets himself killed and his best friend commits seppoku. Then high on ""copium"" he says to the audience that it was all part of the plan and it will pay off later. Of course in the next episode, he scratches the whole plan and comes up with a new one: Send Mary Sue-sama to get herself killed too! (and by doing so the Villain realizes that he hasn't given up). Luckily, that will cause the Villain's wife to realize that she's married to the Villain and refuses him the access to his kid's college funds.And if you didn't think that Toranaga was a deranged psychopath yet, his last prank proves it. He burns JOHN BLACKTHORNE's ship and starts to kill his own villagers, namely to find the perpetrator, but really just to troll JOHN BLACKTHORNE. Then JOHN BLACKTHORNE gets enough and starts to commit seppoku. Just before the blade goes in, Toranaga says ""just a prank bro"" and tells his men to take off the decapitated heads from the spikes.---IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, there were a lot things I found enjoyable like the setup, music and atmosphere. However, some of the decisions and actions of the characters that I presented in a facetious manner above made it very difficult to take the show seriously.",6
"So Anticlimactic","There were some really interesting conflicts in this show that never evolved into actual storylines. I kept waiting for the big moment when the protagonist would strike and be victorious by leveraging everything he had learned. It just never happened. What a waste.The scenery and the acting were all great. There were some parts that were a little difficult to follow at first, but things became clearer as characters developed more. They gave us all the ingredients, mixed them up, but never applied the much needed heat to start the cooking and produce an actual dish.I would recommend this show only if you just want to be able to discuss it with others who watched or to witness the Japanese culture of the time.",5
"Excellent pacing","All the actors are fantastic, the writing is great. At first, the scruffy voice of John Blackthorne threw me off. It seemed forced, almost cartoonish - It either got better, or I got used to it? The character is growing on me. By the end of the second episode my oppinion as far as casting that actor has changed. These are fictional events and characters inspired by the time period, but I feel transported to 1600 Feudal Japan. It's easy to mess up pacing with a show like this. In this case I think it's perfect, I'm glad they released two episodes at the same time - felt like a movie that leaves you wanting more! 10/10.",10
"An outstanding historical epic","""Shogun"" has clawed back some pride in television series production, presenting a truly compelling and intricate historical period-epic offering that has clearly done its homework in getting the accuracy and details spot-on. Shogun sports astonishingly good colour grading, mesmerising performances, and excellent costuming throughout.Depicting the feudal period of the saber-rattling Japans, political crossfire abounds as the far-flung Christian world meets the isolationist honour-bound Japanese, the culture shock depicted onscreen is oftentimes revelatory, sometimes funny, and occasionally chilling. It is a title that evokes an age when Japan was separated from the rest of the world, not just by the roiling East Asian seas, but by religion, economics, and, most importantly, culture.This is a clinical, mature, and sober outing from Disney, and most certainly a world-class effort in exploring the rich world of feudal Japan through period dramatisation. Retaining dialogue in Japanese with subtitles and casting Japanese actors are hallmarks of its faithfulness to representing an authentic setting. This thrillingly realises James Clavell's bestselling book for the screen.There have been justified complaints about Shogun not featuring the lingua franca of that era (Portuguese) with English being oddly referred to as ""Portuguese"". At that time, Portuguese was used for communications between Europeans and Japanese (the Portuguese were the first to arrive in 1543). However, a fully accurate portrayal of the story would be entirely in Portuguese and Japanese, and all of Shogun would have to include subtitles. I think they were mistaken to not have some characters speaking subtitled Portuguese, but clearly made the decision on grounds of accessibility for English speakers. I don't feel it undermines the story enough to be a major issue.8.5/10.",9
"Art","I watched the first 5 episodes, and I impressed with what I watched so farIt's rare to watch tv show with this incredible artwork, every scene is meticulously crafted , the lighting , the color grading, the music, the script. So authentic and poetic.They did an amazing job with the lighting and the shadows , it reflects on the faces making them more dramatic and the emotions more clearer on screen.The duality between the characters are well written, make you believe it , and become attached to them in their acts , despite the fact you agree or disagree with their reasonsLooking forward to watch the next remaining episodes, I wish it keep the same level of beauty .",9
"A Captivating and Authentic Historical Epic","""Shogun"" is a captivating and authentic historical epic that earns a well-deserved 9 out of 10. Based on James Clavell's bestselling novel, this series masterfully brings to life the rich tapestry of feudal Japan through stunning visuals, compelling characters, and an engaging narrative.The show follows the journey of John Blackthorne, a stranded English navigator played with remarkable depth and charisma by Richard Chamberlain. Chamberlain's portrayal of Blackthorne is both nuanced and powerful, capturing the character's initial bewilderment and eventual assimilation into the intricate world of Japanese culture and politics. His transformation from a foreigner struggling to survive to a respected samurai is both believable and compelling.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Toshiro Mifune delivering a standout performance as Lord Toranaga. Mifune's presence and gravitas bring Toranaga to life, portraying him as a cunning and ambitious leader with a strategic mind and a complex moral code. Yoko Shimada, as Lady Mariko, also shines, providing a strong and dignified counterpoint to Blackthorne's character and adding emotional depth to the narrative.One of the series' greatest strengths is its dedication to authenticity. ""Shogun"" immerses viewers in the customs, traditions, and political intrigues of feudal Japan. The attention to detail in set design, costumes, and cultural practices is meticulous, creating a richly textured world that feels both vibrant and true to history. The use of Japanese dialogue with subtitles further enhances the authenticity and helps to draw the audience deeper into the story.The narrative structure of ""Shogun"" is another highlight. The series expertly weaves together personal drama, political intrigue, and cultural exploration, maintaining a steady pace that keeps viewers engaged throughout its lengthy runtime. The plot is filled with twists and turns, as alliances shift and characters navigate the treacherous waters of power and survival. Key moments, such as Blackthorne's evolving relationship with Toranaga and his deepening understanding of Japanese society, are handled with care and provide significant emotional impact.Visually, ""Shogun"" is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography captures the natural beauty of Japan's landscapes, from serene temples and lush gardens to the bustling streets of Edo. The careful composition of each shot and the vibrant color palette contribute to the series' overall aesthetic appeal, making it as beautiful to watch as it is compelling to follow.However, ""Shogun"" is not without its flaws. At times, the pacing can feel slow, particularly in scenes that delve deeply into cultural exposition or intricate political discussions. While these moments are essential to the story's depth, they can occasionally disrupt the flow for viewers more accustomed to faster-paced dramas. Additionally, some of the secondary characters could benefit from further development to fully realize their potential within the complex narrative.Despite these minor issues, ""Shogun"" stands out as a remarkable achievement in historical drama. Its blend of strong performances, authentic cultural representation, and compelling storytelling make it a must-watch for fans of epic tales and historical fiction. The series not only captures the essence of Clavell's novel but also brings a significant period of Japanese history to life with respect and artistry. With its high production values, captivating narrative, and rich character development, ""Shogun"" earns a solid 9 out of 10 and remains a timeless classic in the realm of television.",9
"Best show of the year","This is hands down one of the best shows of the year, maybe of the last few years. Like millions of others, I'm a huge Shogun fan so I was counting down the days until this came out. Even though I couldn't wait to watch it I didn't have a lot of confidence it would be as good as the original but not only was it as good, it was even better and by a lot. The last episode was kind of disappointing. It wasn't bad but it could've been better. I was ok with the ending but it still left me a little unsatisfied so what do they do? They go and renew it for another two seasons to keep this amazing story going. I've already watched this first season a few times.",10
"STUNNING!","When I started watching this series I wasn't sure if I would like it because I'm really not interested in Japanese series and films. But this series was just incredible.I happened to see it on Disney+ and actually only wanted to watch the first episode, but I was so impressed that I watched the other episodes too.This series is truly a masterpiece: I was very impressed by the implementation of the story, the costumes, the scenery and, above all, the love story.Even for FX studios, this series is above average and goosebumps are actually inevitable. If you wanted to see an above average series, watch Shogun.",10
"Sucked me in!","Surprisingly a very good show. I've been hearing a lot about it for quite some time now. Went into not exactly knowing what to expect. Quite a few surprises and had my attention most the way through. The first couple episodes were a bit lack luster to me personally but worth it in terms of story building. Gives off a feudal Japan Game of Thrones vibe in a good way. Quite honestly worth a good watch. Im going to be giving it another watch again soon for sure. A couple things I would change personally and a few storylines I could care less about but all in all it's a strong series with a good plot, and great actors/ actresses.",8
"Is it that good?","After having watched five episodes, I think this is one of the best dramas there has been for a very long time. The Sengoku Period (when this drama is based) is portrayed quite accurately.The political intrigue is fascinating to watch with all the Japanese actors doing a tremendous job of communicating in the ""Japanese way"" (i.e., high-context communication style).Sanada Hiroyuki could very well be up for an award for his strong performance in this.Cosmo Jarvis portrays his character perfectly. Just as I imagined from the book.Anna Sawai fully embodies her stoic Toda Mariko part.As for everyone else, there haven't been any weaknesses in the acting. Not one single weakness. Just wow!For great acting, political intrigue way beyond GOT, and action this drama is the perfect all-rounder.",10
"Very good plot, but... not a single battle?","The story, the characters, actors, visuals, it's all amazing work. Truly a masterpiece.But given the name of the series: SHOGUN, and their own cover with a samurai, carrying a banner, with an army behind, like he's marching it to battle, you would definitely expect SOME battles at least, but there's absolutely nothing.Such a waste of what could've easily been a 10 rated series.The plot develops, the tensions rise, and many people die, but without a single true battle.It seems that they wanted to save the money and the trouble of making the battles that could have been great:The Crimson Sky;
The English man using his ship and cannons;
The English man developing fighting skills and putting them to use;
One final battle between Lady Mariko and Lady Ochiba (vs each other and/or together);
Toranaga's master plan either attacking or defending his land, etc..It became much more of a Japanese House of Cards than an actual Shogun story.Good, but at the same time disappointing.",7
"Game of Thrones all over, and not in a good way","I went into this show so hopeful, and watched as the writers of this miniseries slowly decided that they could write a better story than Clavell, just like GoT. It got worse until the travesty of an episode 9 where they made ridiculous choices about Mariko and Blackthorn that destroyed the meaning behind their storylines. I'm disgusted with what they did, and I plan to watch the old version to get the bad taste out of my mouth.Oh, and that lead actor? What a horrible, wooden face. He had no acting ability and acted like an imbecile rather than the educated man Blackthorn was in the book. Really, he couldn't speak decent Japanese until the end of the story? The show runner should admit that they didn't give a damn about his character.I give this plus one star for the Japanese actors who were stellar.",2
"It is not for the faint hearted","Feudal Japan is brutal. And in the eyes of our main character, life is unreasonably worthless.There are rituals and customs that are hard to understand, and even your most loved characters will not be spared the intense hatred you not only have for them, but also for yourself, having loved those characters in the first place.This show is a must watch if you want to work your brain a little with secret alliances that are actually pretty well hidden.This show is a must watch if you go hard on historic accuracy (I personally have no idea but the experts seem to agree).This show is a must watch if you believe the above is just but background to character development, editing, sound design and score, operating, lighting, production design, and directing.This gives me the goosebumps of excitement.This show is more like West World (S1 only) than it is like Game of Thrones. (I really do NOT understand that comparison)",10
"Amazing show, love everything about it.","The show is awesome! I love how the important characters clash when they talk. The visuals are spot-on, not too much or too little, just like real life.I checked out some negative reviews just to see who could hate this masterpiece, and man, some of them were crazy. Like, seriously, saying stuff like, ""Portugal was good to Japan in the 1600s. I swear I'm Portuguese!"" Come on, do you think your own history books will spill the beans about your crimes against humanity? Portugal was a brutal colonizer, causing a lot of suffering, even in my country, India. They used trade as an excuse to colonize, stealing and destroying indigenous cultures. It's frustrating to see them portrayed so lightly evil in the show. I wish they showed their true colors so we could see the proud Portuguese folks get a reality check.",10
"This is a pleasure to watch","I'm 6 episodes in and this show is amazing. I don't know how the rest will unfold, but so far the 6 hours I have spent watching this were a blast.The dialogue is great. The scenery and props are beautiful. Actors are top notch. Actions and consequences are believable and even the action scenes are bloody and realistic.It feels like a mini version of Game of Thrones, but less chaotic. It has its own little chaotic elements that can catch the viewer off guard, but (so far at least) those don't affect the plot in any significant way.This is historical fiction, but don't let that dissuade you from the fact that it beautifully presents (part of) Japanese history and is based on real characters and events from that time period.I especially recommend this to people who haven't dipped their toes in non-english speaking production.",10
"Excellent","I'm giving it 10 because of how well made it is although a little more war would put the finishing touches to one of the best TV shows I've watched. Marikos storyline is as good as her acting and she links well with all the characters convincing me this is how it actually would be in this era. The violence is real and also convincing due to the special affects being so good. The programme overall builds nicely with plot twists and the ongoing potential of disaster waiting at the end of every choice each character makes. More of shogun and more TV of this nature is desperately needed so hopefully it is renewed and continued for many years to come.",10
"Shogun is so good- i am hooked!","Yesterday's scene with the courtesan's dialogue are worth noting: ""They believe this place is about physical pleasure. Which it is. But it can be more. The people she meets wish for a different life or circumstance. They want to be any place other than where they are. I offer you relief from this. And safety...to create one perfect moment that you wish to inhabit completely. Settle your eyes on what you desire. My unclothed form. Just as I am... with nothing between us. I ask you into my openness.""
I find the sense of democracy vs ease of killing authorities fascinating. On one hand, kings are killed in fake-ambushes to usurp their power. On the other side, the wannabe ruler contorts himself to appear democratic and law-abiding publicly. I wonder if what is worse is the public believes it too? In that sense I applaud people like Trump who shows and uses his double-sidedness openly.Stunning picturesque beauty that i cant differentiate from VFX.Toronaga's multi-layered character is brilliantly portrayed with subtle reveal to the mystery in its culmination. The man i am shown to aspire as the ideal- i kind of still want to be like him despite it all.",10
"Best show I've seen in years","Every once in awhile, a show comes along and blows me away....... Especially so, when it's not a typical genre I'd enjoy. Shogun is definitely fantastic, with great writing, pacing, production and acting. Shogun continues to knock it out of the park episode after episode and I'm turning into a full blown shogun fanatic. After the first two episodes, I was hooked, after 4, I told others to start watching.... And now, after 6.... I am such a fan.... The quality has been amazing, each episode gets better and better. Although after the first couple, I had a tough time with the names, I finally got that part under control and enjoyed a re-watch as well. So glad this is on, such an awesome show!",10
"Masterpiece","Nothing but.The detail, the mood, the concept, ive read the book,
watch RC version but what make this so good is the sublte translation differences in text and in speach.And they speak old Japaneese, trained, developed over YEARS.I think it is better than anything ive seen since well i dont know. 20y?Sawai and Hanada are so good.The translation makes it a new thing how the concentrate on it, the small thing that Mariko (sama?) changes but not and the depth of old Japaneese Samurai culture hits.Ive been watching Tokyo Vice witch is a ""documentary"" with some artistic difference. There are similarites.",10
"Perfect","Once you understand the pacing and that this about subterfuge and strategy, then this is a truly wonderful series.As mannered and subtle as the Japanese aristocracy it is portraying.The standout is Anna Sawai, who is magical as Lady Mariko.She has a porcelain-like beauty, incredibly beguiling, tough, intelligent and heartbreaking in her ongoing distress.Her story arc is so powerfulAnd a refreshing and intelligent climax, forgoing the usual, exhaustingly overdone massive battle.I'm almost hoping they don't make a Part 2 because it's hard to believe it could be as goodXxxxxxxxxxxxxx.",10
"From a 10 to a 5","People giving 9s and 10s obviously didn't watch the whole season 1.The story is set greatly, I was excited to learn about 1600s Japan and world trade at the time, I was impressed by the cinematography, great japanese characters, an inciting problem in the royal power shift and a possible love story between Anjin and Mariko. And then a great letdown.Cosmos character basically doesnt even know his role, he roams through the plot with no value added whatsoever.Is he crucial? Is he an idiot or a genious? The story would basically stay the same if the Pilot lost his head in the pilot.Screenwriting in the 2nd half of the season is a shuffle of buildups and no culminations, canons and navy presented as game changers amount to nothing, dangerous regents amount to nothing, Shoguns big plan amounts to nothing.We lose sense of the plot and the power struggle pretty rapid towards the end, It leaves me sad because the setup was promising so much more.",6
"Barely Recognisable From the Book","Shogun is one of my all-time-favourite novels, but this is so wildly divergent from the original text that it can barely claim to be an adaptation. With all the money that Disney have thrown at it, which is undoubtably visible in the lush production values, it is a shame that they didn't spend more on a better scriptwriter. All the nuance of the original source has been lost. I can accept that TV is different from literature and that some elements need to be cut or curtailed, but here they have excised huge, vital swathes of the original; they kill off major characters who aren't supposed to die at all, and have imbued others with personalities entirely at odds with who they should be. I cannot lay any blame at the feet of the generally excellent cast (except the woefully miscast Cosmo Jarvis), but this is so confusingly and shamefully at odds with the source that it makes me almost yearn for the Richard Chamberlain version. If you want to see feudal Japan done better/properly watch 'The Last Samurai' or, better still, the sublime 'The Seven Samurai'. This is a disgracefully inaccurate adaptation of a vast, sweeping novel. Disney should be shamed.",5
"A brilliant series.","If you're looking for a crash bang wallop samurai karate chopping series then look elsewhere. If it's an intelligent, thoughtful story then you're in the right place.I read the book about forty years ago, and it was also a slowly developing political drama. This may not follow the book, but the feeling is caught perfectly.The acting is superb (although. Cosmo Jarvis as Blackthorne is out of his depth). Hiroyuki Sanada is sensational as Torogana. And Anna Sawai matches him playing Mariko.The slow burning plot development is enthralling, with the confusion of Blackthorne about the Japanese culture and manners being a good vehicle to enable exposition.The power games between the war lords is played out with subtly and creates ongoing tension, with small actions having huge consequences. The players have to control their emotions. Alliances are made and broken, so you are still unsure of the outcome by episode ten.The direction is excellent, the lighting and camera work top notch. All in all a fabulous series.",10
"A fantastic series","This was one of those rare moments when you feel like you've struck gold when scrolling, whilst wondering, what to watch on TV.Shogun is absolutely incredible. One of the best TV series I've seen. The acting, the scenery, the music are all spectacular. No knowing a great deal about Japanese history, I found this a really wonderful series that goes into detail about how the clans and politics of Japan were formed centuries ago. I loved that.In the last year I've blitzed series like Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul and the Sopranos, and I can honestly say that Shogun 'might' be my favourite one of the lot.",10
"Must watch!","Really recommend for people who are interested in mini series, the show has anime style feel to mainly because of the translation part. The show starts of with a bang, I was hooked from the very beginning. The pacing is really good, the show has anime style to it as well. There s a lot of talking internally scheming, a lot of characters and lots of. Action and well done drama as well. It been really refreshing from the heaps of TV content and movies that are produced right now, the show is a breath of fresh, the only gripe i have about the show it's only 10 episodes and they try to cram everything in that. I wish they made it as a two season show, but oh well people want to watch all the mindless shows. But still for the 10 episodes it really good, waiting for the season final !",10
"Defies expectations","This is not your usual TV series. You have to read a lot of subtitles (no, it never stops), but it's worth it. This goes not as you might think because this series takes plays in a different time and in a different culture with different values to ours and that's what makes it so good. It's unpredictable and shocking and with that truly entertaining! It's definitely not what you would expect from something that runs on the Disney channel! Besides that, the costumes are amazing and the pictures are too. You really feels like you are brining transported to somewhere else. I really enjoy the series!",10
"Gold standard of story telling.","There are other reviews that go more indepth but I just wanted to write this to give the show the love it deservesEverything about it feels so real. You can clearly tell the actors truly gave it their all. After watching this episode I think the series just became my favourite tv show of all time.I can understand not liking the themes or characters in the show but anybody can admit the show is good. Unless fungus has started to form in your brain.Zenith of the medium. Hallmark of media. Gold standard of storytelling. Apogee of creativity. Vertex of invention. Crest of ingenuity. Acme of imagination. Pinnacle of innovation. Epic of epics. Legend among legends. Peak fiction.",10
"What a brilliant journey","Before I started this I was a little sceptical. Shogun is my favorite book ever, I red it 4 times and I was not sure this mini series would be at least as good as the 1st one, with Chamberlain. Boy was I wrong!! In the 70 series, Toranaga looks like heartless, stone taught leader with no emotions. In the FX series, Sanada does a brilliant job, showing us countless expressions and emotions of the character. From fear (you know when you see it, no spoilers), happiness, determination and so on. Mariko is so graceful, the actress plays her serenity perfect, compared to the actress from the 1st series. Even Blacktorne is good (not as these 2 but very close), he looks so humane and fragile sometimes. Actually, you won't see a weak link in the acting department, support cast also.The cinematography is very good, I love that they show different scenarios (rain, sunny, winter, etc), the attention to details is mind-blowing for a tf series.Please don't compare this to game of thrones. That was a fantasy TV series. Anything was permitted. Shogun is about HUMANS, about emotions, honor, duty and so much more. It looks slow paced, you...contemplate this show instead of watch it, you take your time. Rarely I've been so absorbed and glued to the screen from a TV series like I'm here and again, I'm surprised they could pull this off.The rating is well deserved, actors, cinematography, everything is perfect. My only ""problem"" is that it could have been 2 seasons long and not just 10 episodes. The book is big enough for this buy hey, we must enjoy what we have and Shogun is by far the best show of the year. Safe to say is (if they keep it like this the remaining 4 episodes) it will become a classic and one of the best ever.",10
"Episode 8 just killed it for me!","I don't know what else to say.. everything has been said in so many ways by other reviewers about the show. One thing I wouldn't make a point about and that is the true grit and resolve shown bu the actors and their utmost conviction to playing their part right. Everyone in episode 8 performed so well. After last episode 7 ending, i was totally convinced what path would it take but then it took an unthinkable turn. I am so impressed by the production and I wish this could go on and on at least one or two more seasons but I think this is enough. I hope people outside Hulu get to see this mini series (soon).",10
"Shogun, the most powerful manipulator.","While many people expect huge battles like in huge Western movie productions, remember, this is a story about Japan... and being subtle is intelligent. The history of a master manipulator, more than a dumb down story of good and bad, the most powerful isn't always the hero (if there was any). The art of deceiving by ALL sides, clearly explained on the last episode, a great ending (no need for another CGI fest). The best TV short miniseries of recent memory.I am Portuguese, my name is also a Japanese word (many left by us). I know my history, the good and the bad. I'm not ashamed of my ancestry, nor am I responsible for the entire population of a country, its Government or Church. Was an honor to be part of Japan's history for almost 100 years (especially in Nagasaki), terminated because of fear mongering and lack of religious freedom. Nobody should be pushed into any religion (adopt if you want, never forced), but no one should be persecuted or die either (and so many Japanese suffered for it). After this they had forced isolation from the rest of the world for more than 250 years, but that is another story. In reality it's all about power, and the Tokugawa Shogunate was the most powerful!",10
"Good, But Not Shogun","I don't write many reviews, and honestly have little to say about this other than to express my wonder at why they would choose to make a ""Shogun"" of this caliber, and then jettison the essence of story itself? This is entertaining, and well made, the acting quite sound...but it is not Shogun. And this is not the usual trimming of events and characters that must accompany moving from the superior storytelling medium of books to film - this is changing characters completely, altering their motivations, the ""whys"" behind the ""whats."" Characters bear no resemblance to their written counterparts, and with their very character and motivations recast, the story loses its purpose and sense - it is an entirely different tale and lesson. And I can only wonder why, and marvel at what sort of hubristic arrogance leads these film makers and adaptive writers to do things like this. Do they really think they're a better story tellers than Clavell? It's just kind of sad to me.",7
"A missed opportunity","-Update- After watching the last episode, in which the screenwriter tramples on Clavell's original novel and its characters, I lowered my review one more star and propose a suggestion: Call the series ""A boring story about samurai."" Remove ""Shogun"" title because this is not Shogun. What a superb blunder yo made!I subscribed to this site after seeing that this adaptation of James Clavell's great novel has a score of 9 out of 10. In honor of this beloved author and his novel, which I enjoyed so much in my adolescence, I feel compelled to write this review and denounce the appalling screenplay and the complete neglect of the best moments of the story, entirely absent or distorted in this adaptation. The screenwriter took the main protagonist, a magnificent, astute, and brave character, and turned him into an insecure, cowardly, and somewhat stuttering stowaway. He took a politically astute genius with a noble heart like Toranaga and turned him into a spoiled child capable of striking a woman. In the process, he rejuvenated all the characters, who in the original story are at least twenty years older (I thought we had already overcome that disgrace of millennial productions, where we couldn't see old actors). The beautiful friendship that emerges between Toranaga and Blackthorne disappears. The intense love that develops between Blackthorne and Mariko vanishes. Mariko's best qualities fade away as they portray her as a warrior, slightly attracted to another woman? Of course! Because otherwise, it can't be a story of this era. What a sad era! To those who believe this adaptation is good, I suggest first and foremost reading the books or, alternatively, watching the 1980 adaptation starring Richard Chamberlain. Although there were cuts in that adaptation, as in any adaptation of a written work, at least the spirit of each character and the most important moments of the story were respected. In conclusion, a true missed opportunity, because this story deserved an update, an improvement in visual aesthetics (because the 1980 version looks very dated today). Perhaps a new version, in a few years, can accomplish what this one could not.",2
"It doesn't get better than this.","This is how to do television. A beautifully set, written drama, with superlative acting. If you see any show in 2024, it should be this I read the original book. I'm old enough to have seen the original Shogun series. This builds on those and some of the finest television available. Binge watch it or savour it. Just make sure you watch it, I can't wait until the next series I hope this does well in the awards season next year. Why IMDb make me say more is beyond me But apparently, I need another 120 or so. It's it's great, very good marvellous super smashing Jolly Good fun But maybe not for kids.",10
"Excellence in FX","Not quite finished with Shogun, but giving it the highest rating based on what I have seen so far. Praise to FX and entire creative team for telling a story in much the way it might have been like...the language barrier, and moreso the culture and custom barrier...very well done how initial contact is a struggle and prone to puzzlement and misunderstanding. Beautiful production, really great soundtrack, and most of all, excellent acting and characters. Maybe Blackthorne was of all of them a bit abbreviated in development, but maybe that reflects the extent of his Japanese fluency too. Good idea for FX to do a show with a finite duration...was a bit disappointed how they let ""Tyrant"" go off into the ether...",10
"Not a regurgitation","Were you expecting a regurgitation of the previous Shogun? Well, you'll either be disappointed, or like me, really encouraged!Mariko-sama has an amazing role in this epic. She is not the ""typical"" walk 4 paces behind her man woman. She is a baddass woman with weapon skills and a true passion. She's not waiting around to be wooed by some mysterious man, she's striking out, making her own demands and boundaries.This story no longer revolves around Anjin-san, it is much deeper and full of consideration. In fact, in previous Shogun, it was pretty easy to follow along with the simple Japanese wording. This newer edition is more complex, more interesting vocabulary, and less subservience.As love in Richard Chamberlain as I was, this new edition does the author credit. It is a lovely and engaging series.",10
"One Woman Army","Such a brilliant, focused yet pivotal episode to the overall story of ShÃµgun. Give Anna Sawai all the Awards right away. Her performances have stood out every episode she has been in - no easy feat when playing alongside Sanada, Jarvis & many other greats. It's been such a delight to see how the showrunners made this adaptation Mariko's story throughout - even more so than Blackthorne or Toranaga - & even with possibly bringing it to a conclusion in this episode, they still work in important details that give further insight to her state of mind and motivations, through intriguing scenes with Ochiba, Fr Martin & her son. Bravo. Even if Mariko's story is likely over for now, I'm eager to see the ramifications of it end and what it means now for everyone else. Bring on the finale.",10
"Put my whole family on this show and they are addicted!","This is a once in a generation phenomenon! Like GOT that moved and changed people, SHOGUN has all the ingredients to break records! Only 2 episodes in and I am starving for more. Every frame you are on edge at every moment. If you are a casual watcher who at the end of the day just wants to be entertained, this is a MUST WATCH! If you are an avid Cinema watcher who catches every detail, plot point, and loves beautiful cinematography, this is a MUST WATCH. I'm honestly getting my whole family on this show and they are loving it! The amount of work and passion that goes into this show is clearly felt, enjoyed and experience!",10
"Best TV ever!","This series is awesome. Amazing story and perfect cast. Awesome attention to detail. A series that, ""Has everything!"" I'm no student of Japanese history but even there, I think that attention to detail is fabulous. I'm OK with reading books that make me want to watch the film but this made me want buy the book. I bought the book!It would be too shallow to suggest the book is about Samuri. It really isn't, it's more layer and complex. In fact it's almost Shakespearean.There's a deep and profound love story contained within that could easily have been influenced by Romeo & Juliet. That's no trivial or shallow claim and the core of that subplot really digs at the heart!",10
"I love it!","I just love this series. Everything related to mid-aged Japan - their tradition, culture, courage, weapon, samurai life, emperors... - absolutely everything I love.The scenario isn't cheap, dialogues aren't redundant and boring, the plots are great, the storyline pulls you in more and more, it's forcing you to watch more and more.Even though I gave it 10/10, we come to one and only major flaw of the show. Characters and cast is great, except one. Cosmo Jarvis is visually and audibly ANNOYING person. I read a book many years ago, but I could never imagine the main character as Cosmo Jarvis. He's just repellent to watch. I don't know what, there's something about the actor that bothers you in all scenes he appears, he's just not the kind of guy you could imagine as the main character of such great adventure. And his voice... Oh my god, how his hoarse voice annoys me... It's like you're listening to a seventy year-old man speaking... Yuck...",10
"A masterpiece series!","The Shogun series is an absolute triumph, seamlessly blending historical accuracy with gripping storytelling. With its richly developed characters, breathtaking visuals, and themes of honor and power, it's a must-watch for anyone craving an immersive journey into feudal Japan. The Shogun series is a mesmerizing tapestry of feudal Japan, weaving together intricate plots, dynamic characters, and stunning visuals. Each episode is a captivating journey through the complexities of samurai culture, filled with suspense, drama, and unforgettable moments. It's a true masterpiece that leaves a lasting impression long after the final credits roll.",10
"Decent but overrated.","I don't really understand why this gets raving reviews, I'm guessing lots of people haven't watched classic Japanese Samurai movies or media from Japan.I give this show a 6/10 based on the main cast performance alone, mainly the Japanese actors. But other than that, the plot is extremely weak and nonsensical. The show doesn't do a good job of explaining the setting (which GOT does extremely well), and in fact the setting is clearly a nonsensical excuse to justify the show (it was written as fiction by a Westerner obviously). It's basically an excuse to have a Western guy come into Japan and show Japanese culture. It's as bland as ""The Last Samurai"" but even worse.The main Western actor is also not memorable visually, and the constant trope of him not understanding Japanese and needing a translator gets tedious more than it is interesting.The first episode is basically good, maybe the second. But then it just gets nowhere. It feels like an 80s movie (which it was) that aged very badly, in an age where Japanese films or films such as ""Silence"" exist.The main fundamental plot is to follow the story of the Westerner, or the ""Anjin"" (Pilot). None of this is interesting, you don't even make sense of what this Westerner wants and his scene are cringe worthy. Even a videogame like ""Nioh"" by Team Ninja presented this story in a much more effective manner, with a better visual character than Cosmo Jarvis.This is a series that needed a much better characterisation of the Westerner, with better script, but also a better more beautiful and memorable actor such as Viggo Mortensen or Henry Cavill.I was honestly extremely bored throughout the entire series and forced myself to continue watching.Again, the only true positive is the beautiful performance by the Japanese actors/actresses. Everything else is weak plot, weak characterisation, etc.I just can't see where people call this ""Japanese GOT"".",6
"Nice try, but no","To start, it's funny to hear Mariko translates back and forth like ChatGPT-3.5Joke aside, the only reason I can think of for the high rating of this show (aside from the possibly hired rate farms), is that most westerners are not accustomed with the super-polite Japanese tradition that puts honor and allegiance in front of everything. It causes some excitement to see 100 bows/episode and countless ""Sama"" and ""Denka"" honorifics in a part of the world where trash talking is commonAside from Takehiro Hira (as Ishido Kazunari), everyone's performance (including Sanada, sadly!) is subpar to cringy. Characters make senseless decisions that are not consistent with their backgrounds just to create a superficial shock (without spoiling anything, ep. 8, anyone?)Worst of all, there are no central questions that raise tension. Thus, it resolves to nothing, if it even does! Scene after scene I find myself waiting for nothing, until I reached a finale that felt like a ruined, em.. you know whatMariko's arch could've been a great leverage, but it was rushed and didn't provide enough to feel connected to her.One more note, the show has a few sex scenes that do not add anything but some fless. Why? It could've at least been a family friendly show, which lowers the expectations. But no, marketing dude, marketing!",2
"This is a treat. A view of Shogun through Mariko's eyes.","Yes I read the book. Yes I watched the 80's tv version with Richard Chamberlain. What I find fascinating is that it is true that the female samurai were held to the same standard and duty as the men, while wielding no real power. The samurai men could decree that they would sacrifice their lives and their children and their wife as their lord decreed. I'm at episode 9, and I know Toranaga's true goal is to become Shogun, military leader of Japan, while the young heir becomes old enough to rule. Sometimes I think that we in the Western world think we are great for having a few centuries of history, when civilizations much older than ours have customs, duty and wisdom that should be respected. It's a good show, worth watching.",10
"FX nailed it with Shogun","I'm already two episodes in, and my goodness, Shogun is as good as others say it is. The story, the setting, the design, characters; all just fantastic. It's another hit for FX, and one I did not expect to be this well designed.I certainly appreciate the fact that the show sticks to Japan's roots (the language, the set pieces, and cultural practices) as it should be for any other ""foreign"" depiction in TV and movies. It's something you just don't really get when America does something involving another country and its culture. The biggest troupe would be where the Japanese main character all of a sudden can communicate with the English-speaking foreigner because 'why not?' Or even when Lady Mariko, who does speak English, is actually given a reason and background as to how she can speak English to John while the Spanish translators are not around. That's one example of good character building.And as for the show itself, Shogun ticks off all the boxes for what you'd want in prime time TV. Shogun is deep in its story. It's not as simple as a foreigner washing ashore in Japan. Now the Englishman is in the midst of a Feudal impeachment which is consequential to starting a war. Camera work is really good, especially for that follow-up shot with the assassin in the palace or the rough stormy weather on the ship. Characters were also interesting with their own motive, with some even hiding something.Overall, Shogun was really captivating for me even if I was only two episodes in. Definitely can't wait to see more.",10
"This is how to remake a masterpiece","This is textbook how to remake a masterpiece - you make it even better. A lot better.You keep the story/characters more/less the same. But you improve on the acting, directing, editing, cinematography, picture quality, sound quality. Watching the 2024 version of Shogun is like watching a high-budget movie franchise that doesn't miss any details.Some idiots think that when you remake something, you have to change it all up and make it ""yours"". That's because they're idiots and don't know better.So not only is the remake better, but it also seems more authentic and actually truer to the source.The 2024 Shogun is a masterpiece collection you want to keep for yourself. You can give the old Shogun collection to your friend or relatives.",10
"Fantastic sums it up","I have seen the 1980's Shogun mini series and enjoyed it tremendously. I thought that this new version would be a dud as many remakes are, but boy I am blown out of the water by its brilliance. The acting, the pacing, the tension and the surprises in every episode makes one want it to continue forever. It's got action, romance, intrigue and humor so well weaved into the storyline that one must give Kudos to the whole team. I particularly liked the build up to 8th and the 9th episode and now can't wait for the last episode to be released. All in all absolutely the best show in the recent times.",10
"Next ""Big Thing""?","It is pretty incredible. I think this has the power to be the next Game of Thrones. Will the subtitles put people off? I hope not, but it's always a factor.I'm sure some more articulate will set up this story on here, but here's a quick paragraph:These first two episodes follow the first Englishman to cross the Japanese borders and what this means for the country. The country is in a matter of states with no appointed Shogun. After being captured by multiple parties, the Englishman brings information that the Portuguese and Spanish have ""claimed"" this part of the world saying; The kings right to claim any non-Catholic land discovered by their subjects. This infuriated the leader. Letting the Englishman ""John Blackthorne"" live, assuming to be their source of information- let's him stay on his quarters for the night. The rest I'll leave it to you to watch or find out yourself.This is epic in every sense. Perfectly balanced pacing in terms of story telling and gruesome action.All actors play their roles very convincingly, Cosmo Jarvis is channelling something between a Tom Hardy character but with a Daniel Plainview cadence of speaking. Bring on the conspiracies, politics and play for who to be Shogun.Bottom line is I love this already after 2 episodes.",9
"Superb!","This type of show is the ones you don't want to miss out, it starts a little bit slow but now that I am all the way to the 8th episode I understand why, now I don't want it to end! The story is really good, the characters are great, the actors are brilliant! You get to know a little about their culture and is very interesting and we can learn (the good things) from them. I honestly didn't want to give it a 10 because I want to wait for the last episode, the reason I'm writing this before getting to the end is because I'm excited and wanted to share it so you guys won't miss it. Give it a try you will love this show I can assure you!",9
"Samurai House of Cards","I told my niece who's also watching the show, it's slow but still great. It took me back to House of Cards, where every moment is tense, important, and a masterclass of acting and directing. FX continues to prove they are not just the home of movies but excellent tv. Shogun provides a true experience to old Japan and it's culture; the sets are beautiful, the cast is intentional with every word and movement, the director provides a depth and understanding to each characters feelings and thoughts yet can still leave one guessing. The old culture shows us that everything we do is meaningful and how much weight a single word or stare actually means. Also, I'm a sucker for flashbacks and when they are used correctly it brings so much more depth to characters and situations. This show allows us to watch as if we were listening to an audio book, and they are illustrating what's happening as we listen. I would like more action as the true action Stan I am but they provide realism to how battles occur, they take time and planning.",9
"Brilliant","When it comes to anything Disney makes lately we are all extremely sceptic of what it's going to be like. Mostly we expect it to be a mess.But this show! Oh my word! Thank you Disney! We all forgive you for all the rubbish you've made lately because this is absolutely brilliant!The script the acting the scenery the producing the editing the acting , everything scores 10/10.People who read this review, watch it! Watch it now it's brilliant! One of those shows you just can't wait to see the next episode!Now I have another 69 characters to write so I'll end with this:
Its the best series/movie from Disney since bambi in 19 whatever!Again we'll done Disney! 10/10.",10
"If you loved the book, you'll hate this show","At least, if you're like me. If you are incapable of judging movies or shows as their own things, without comparing it to the book, you will hate this. It manages to completely destroy the beauty and dignity and honor of virtually every character, while (alright to) represent a book which is stepped in beauty and dignity and honor.All of the incredible representation of the code of conduct expected at this time in Japan is missing. The courtesy, the honor of proper behavior, the careful ballet of every conversation, is thrown out of the window like a chamber put into the filthy Streets of Europe.The story is completely, COMPLETELY changed. Characters that don't exist in the book. Plotlines that don't exist in the book. All of the best parts of the book are not only absent, they're contradicted by the actions of the characters in the showA lot of people seen to love it. If I had never read the book maybe I would. But I have read the book. Several times. It's one of my favorite books. And this series is a wholly unworthy representation of it.Not. Even. Close.",3
"Characters Worth Caring For","I won't repeat what others have already said in their reviews. Yes, across the board this series hits all the marks.What stands out the most is that I actually care about these characters, which is a rare feat in both film and television these days. Halfway through the season and I'm deeply invested in the characters and how their stories will play out.Episode 5 actually had me tearing up. This is beautiful work and I'm grateful that I get to experience people working in the television industry who deeply care about their craft.After the show is done I highly look forward to reading the book and the 1980 TV series to compare.",10
"Most marvelous serie ever seen","Really Extraordinary serie!!!In my intense binging life of series, this is by far the most beautiful series I have seen. 15/10Acting is fantasticStory is compelling, interesting and excitingFilming is marvelousMood excellentIt's all there in this truly piece of passion!Maybe not the genre of some people but if you like rings of power, outlander or other historical series this is really your thing!Probably the best work they've made and willing to watch this seasonsssssssss.You know that feeling that you look forward to the evening due you just know you'll enjoy the moment.That's this serie!",10
"Shogun 2024: Feudal Epic Reforged or Missed Opportunity?","FX's 2024 reboot of James Clavell's classic novel, Shogun, took the world by storm. Stepping out of the shadow of its 1980 miniseries predecessor, this reimagining carved its own path, offering a fresh take on the clash of cultures and the struggle for power in 17th-century Japan.The series excelled in its world-building. From the opulent castles to the bustling streets, viewers would transport to a meticulously crafted Sengoku period Japan. A major improvement was the depth given to the Japanese characters. Where the original focused on the outsider's perspective, Shogun 2024 allowed figures like Lord Toranaga and Mariko to shine as complex individuals with their own motivations. The political maneuvering and battles were thrilling, keeping on the edge of the seats. The show also balanced the brutality of the era with moments of tenderness and emotional resonance. The cast delivered stellar performances. Hiroyuki Sanada brought gravitas and cunning to Toranaga, while Anna Sawai's Mariko was a captivating blend of strength and vulnerability. Even with a lead character in John Blackthorne (played by Cosmo Jarvis), the series didn't rely solely on the Western perspective.While generally praised for its historical grounding, some purists found liberties taken with certain events. The lack of the pivotal Battle of Sekigahara was a point of contention for some viewers. The later episodes felt rushed, cramming in plot points that could have benefited from a longer season.The series boasted stunning cinematography, capturing the beauty and grandeur of Japan's landscapes and architecture. The costume design was equally impressive, with meticulous attention to detail reflecting the social hierarchy of the time. The score deserves mention as well, weaving traditional Japanese instruments with a modern touch that perfectly complemented the narrative.Shogun 2024 is a must-watch for fans of historical dramas and epic storytelling. While not without minor flaws, the series stands out with its captivating characters, rich cultural immersion, and well-crafted production. It's a worthy successor to the original, offering a fresh perspective on a timeless tale.Though the season finale provided a satisfying conclusion, the open-ended nature leaves room for second season, something very much desired by many viewers.",8
"I love it","Two episodes in and I'm already in love with the show. I haven't seen the original 1980s Shogun so I can only rate it as a standalone show instead of a remake. The actors are all top notch. Sanada is always a commanding presence on screen so I knew he would knock it out of the park as do all Japanese actors but Cosmo Jarvis is no less than great as well. The production value is high and the script well written! The action is well choreographed and the story is more than thrilling! If the rest of the show is like the first two episodes then I smell some Emmy wins. If you have a knack for Japanese culture and also shows about intrigues and scheming then I can only recommend this show to you!",10
"A Captivating Journey","## A Captivating Journey: A Review of FX's ""Shogun""FX's recent miniseries, ""Shogun,"" is a triumph on all fronts. Based on James Clavell's sprawling novel, the show transports viewers to 17th century Japan, a land of vibrant culture, fierce loyalty, and ruthless political intrigue.The story centers on John Blackthorne (played with stoic intensity by Cosmo Jarvis), an English pilot shipwrecked on the shores of Japan. Thrust into a completely alien world, Blackthorne is initially treated with suspicion and hostility. However, his resilience and resourcefulness catch the eye of Lord Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), a powerful warlord on the rise.**A Feast for the Senses**One of the show's greatest strengths is its meticulous world-building. The production design is stunning, with lavish sets and costumes that recreate the grandeur of feudal Japan. From the bustling marketplaces of Edo to the serene beauty of a Zen garden, every frame is a visual feast.The series also excels in its portrayal of Japanese customs and traditions. The clash between Western individualism and Eastern collectivism is a central theme, explored with sensitivity and nuance. Viewers gain a deeper appreciation for the samurai code, the intricacies of tea ceremonies, and the importance of honor in Japanese society.**Compelling Characters Fuel the Drama**The performances in ""Shogun"" are nothing short of phenomenal. Jarvis delivers a captivating portrayal of Blackthorne's transformation, from a brash outsider to a man deeply affected by his experiences in Japan. Sanada is equally brilliant as Lord Toranaga, a complex character who commands both respect and fear. The supporting cast is also stellar, with breakout performances from Tadanobu Asano and Yoko Minamino.**More Than Just Swords and Intrigue**While the series features thrilling action sequences and political maneuvering worthy of ""Game of Thrones"" comparisons, ""Shogun"" offers much more. It's a love story that transcends cultural boundaries, a coming-of-age tale for Blackthorne, and a thoughtful exploration of cultural exchange.The miniseries format allows for a deep dive into the characters and their motivations. The pacing is deliberate, allowing viewers to savor the richness of the story and the beauty of the setting.**A Must-Watch for History Buffs and Drama Fans Alike**""Shogun"" is a truly exceptional television experience. It's a show that will stay with you long after the credits roll, prompting reflection on cultural understanding, the power of resilience, and the enduring human search for belonging. Whether you're a history buff, a drama aficionado, or simply seeking a captivating adventure, ""Shogun"" is a must-watch.",10
"Powerful series with excellent acting","I looked forward to this new Shogun series as soon as it was announced having relished the original series with Richard Chamberlain. This series is much better than the original. The in-depth focus on the Japanese characters elevates the dramatic quality of the show. All the actors were superb except for Cosmo Jarvis who was stiff and had limited emotional depth as the Englishman who steers his ship to Japan and is unprepared for the reception. Anna Sawai is particularly good as the interpreter who falls for the Englishman. She shows the depth of her acting ability in the last two episodes. The story line focuses on how Lord Toranaga uses wile and strategy to avoid war in his quest to become the leader of Japan. Jarvis as the Anjin plays a useful role to help viewers learn about the culture. Shogun should win many awards this year. Well done.",8
"Really one of the best shows out there","Every episode is amazingly well acted and full of emotion, it draws you in and keeps you guessing and doesn't treat the audience like children. Can't recommend this show enough it really knocks it out the park. Only thing I wish is that I don't have to wait a week for each release! 10/10. The emotion, the setting, the authenticity of the period makes this such an interesting and captivating show, it would be a shame for anyone to miss out on. It makes me want to read the books, I haven't had this feeling since watching GoT, the world building is excellent and the portrayal of the brutal almost barbaric nature of feudal Japan but also mixed with duty and honour makes you see into a world that seems could only exist in science fiction.",10
"Really Well Done (Re-read before watching)","Introduction:
I believe this is a really well done screen adaptation of the book. I read the novel years ago and didn't really enjoyed it, but since I was so young (~18 or so) I didn't truly appreciate Clavell's brilliant writing. Years later I fell in love with Japanese history, particularly the Sengoku Jidai, after playing Total War: Shogun 2. During college I delved deep into feudal Japanese history, including taking as many courses on Japanese history that I could to complete my class requirements (since history was one my majors). It was at this time when I realized the brilliance in Clavell's novel. He retold the history of Tokugawa Ieyasu's (Yoshi Toranaga in the book) rise to power and his unification of Japan, as well as focussed on the real life relationship between Ieyasu and the the English navigator, William Adams (John Blackthorne). Every character in the book has a historical counterpart, and while some of the characters lived a few years before or after the timestamp of 1600 (just before the key Battle of Sekigihara) Clavell's depiction of them stays relatively true to history even with his artistic retelling of the events. Upon hearing that this series was in development I re-read as a prelude for myself.Review:
While the show is not a one-to-one comparison to the book, it comes pretty darn close. Some reviews have been exceptionally nitpicking of the series and complain about trivial details that only a fan of the original novels would notice. Having said that, the series does change some details, including characters appearances, dialogue, and some important events; however, THE BOOK IS 1152 PAGES LONG!!! Obviously the series can't be made a carbon copy of the book. It would be too much on screen and, frankly, would be exceptionally hard to convey every detail from the book. The show stays true to most of the themes in the book, gives a solid historical depiction of 1600 Japan, and has some very awesome action. The writers keep the same sentiment that Clavell had in the novel, and added some very minor details from the book as well as historical details, showing that they truly understand and are familiar with the source material. It's the complete package.",10
"Overrated and underwhelming.","The costumes in this series are fantastic, truly the best part. Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. The story itself was a slog. It progressed slowly and ultimately failed to deliver on the expectations it built. I found myself forcing myself to finish it, feeling disappointed most of the time. This disappointment is only amplified by the fact that in one of the final episodes, the lead actor is literally called a diversion and a joke in the whole scheme of things. The story itself didn't even seem to need him.The lead actor's performance further weakens the series. The acting was uneven, with moments of cringe. Several characters felt like one-dimensional caricatures rather than actual people.Interestingly, a whopping 37% of viewers rated it a perfect 10. This raises a red flag, suggesting the ratings might be inflated or inauthentic. For me, however, it was a major disappointment.",5
"Honestly not overhyped","This show goes crazy on social media and in the internet. When there is a hype like that, it usually indicates a show being pushed with marketing to cover bad productions. We've had a lot of overhyped shows in the last few years but Shogun breaks this streak-like developments.Shogun combines historical and traditional, cultural and adventurous elements and this makes it a perfect arrangement of a great script, amazing acting and the best what cinematography has to offer.This is a show that you will keep in your mind. Not only the suspenseful story but the whole feeing and setting. I'm not a person that gives that 10p often, but this show deserves it. Hands down the best cinematographical product of the last 5 years, at least.",10
"Excellent","An almost flawless drama with so many great elements. The set and production design provides a convincing background for a multi layered drama. The story unfolds with perfect pacing and benefits from a mostly Japanese or Japanese speaking cast adding to the authenticity. This works particularly well when John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis) is at the centre of the scene with his lack of understanding of Japanese requiring interpretation. Anna Sawai is excellent as Toda Mariko with one of the most nuanced performances you will ever see. Having to play the dutiful part of a woman in a time were woman were little more than a chatel, while being able to portray every inner thought and at the same time adopting a facial expression that shouldn't give anything away is astounding. However, as good as she is the entire cast deliver exceptional performances, there are no weaknesses even amongst the bit part characters.There is no shirking from the brutality of feudal Japan and is not for the squeamish, but it doesn't cross a line into unnecessary voyeurism. A shout out too to the special effects team for the earthquake sequence that is brilliantly done.This is so close to being a 10/10. Having not read the book I don't know if the ending is accurate but it does feel like it was ended with an eye on a follow up. Leaving a sense that there was something left unsaid but it does make sense in regard to the whole series. Also the exception to the great acting on show is sadly Cosmo Jarvis whose bizarre low grunting while literally stumbling around as though he has just put his back out grates throughout.As it turns out it has now been announced that there will be a further series and that the Clavell estate will have oversight, so fingers crossed we will get a worthy follow up.",9
"Is exactly what every fan was expecting, and more!","When I saw the trailer it looked like a series that has potential, but I was not expecting it to be that good! It follows the book storyline very well and simultaneously creates a perfectly executed story. The actors were amazing, the cinematography was what was supposed to be, and the authenticity of Japan was preserved. James Clavell's story can be read in a hundred years and will make you a true fan of Japanese culture, and those series will concrete this. There is no political or cultural mismatch or anything that pushed you to some external narrative in the present time and completely kept you in the world of Shogun. I hope they come with Season 2 next year as we all wait!",10
"Fantastic show, finally!!","Beautiful historical story telling, great acting, writing, cinematography and excellent costume. I am totally hooked and feel I've been taken on an epic journey 500 years back.Every episode is mesmerising and captivating. I have always been intrigued by the Japanese culture. This series gives an insight into the rich Japanese culture that values loyalty, integrity, and honour and highlights the West/ East differences and political intrigue.Please don't be put off by subtitles, this is what makes the show authentic. If you like GOT, then this is definitely a show for you. Finally there's something worth watching on TV. Highly recommended!!",10
"Thoughtful","While this isn't a pure retelling of the story outlined in the novel, it captures the essence of the Clavel classic. Beautifully developed characters that are marvelously acted. Shogun is about so much more than just the samurai. It is a tale of leadership and testament to the beauties of Japanese culture.None of that is left out in this television version. I'm so thankful that it is a 10 part series rather than a two hour feature.Beautifully shot. The costumes and wardrobe are incredible. My only wish is that this becomes available to the broadest of audiences outside of Hulu. The subtle complexities be to be watched again and again. Gripping and wonderful.Such masterful storytelling.",10
"A Classic for the Ages","As a fan of the Sengoku Era, I have long waited for a show like this. The old Shogun adaptation is good but it has not aged well. I wished for someone to adapt the Tales of the Otori, or perhaps the actual history, or take another pass at adapting Shogun with the benefits of modern technology and bigger budgets. We finally have it. And it is almost everything I could have wished for. It is near perfection.The sets, the cinematography, the acting, the writing, the attention to detail, faithfulness to the source material, in fact going beyond the source material (which we need to remember was written an age without ready abundant access to research that internet allows us now) to actual Japanese history, culture, traditions up to minute details - everything is incredible.If I really have to nitpick to find a flaw, I would say the natural beauty of Japanese landscape has a very distinct look, with the iconic cherry blossoms and vibrant colors. The show being primarily shot in Canada is not able to recreate that aesthetic..But I have heard at least some shooting was done in Japan, so perhaps this will be remedied in future episodes. So this is not enough to take away a whole point from my rating.I hope this becomes a cultural phenomenon and a darling of history and fantasy enthusiasts next to shows like Rome, Game of Thrones, Tudors, I Claudius etc. It will be well deserved.",10
"More please","So many tv series get one or more wrong, not this, the tone the script the pace the action the drama the blend of cultures not hiding behind new age movements and sticking to good old fashioned story telling in a great way. Can't wait for the next episodes.I'm also happy that there was no agenda pushing like so many Disney programs these days. Director 10/10 casting 10/10 acting 10/10 location 10/10 I think as time goes on there will be less subs I feel that's the way it's going anyway. But so far shogun is everything I wanted it to be.47 ronin with extra sake and less Hollywood .Perfect.",10
"Fantastic","Only two episodes in and took a bit to get my head around as to exactly what was happening. But by the end of episode two, it was very evident and the setup for the next episode is fantastic and what's to come throughout the season. I think this show is not going to disappoint anyone and will probably finish on a cliffhanger.I lived in Japan for a year and getting to know the customs and traditions is complicated for an outsider, this show captures the intricacies of Japanese culture unlike most shows and its layered on top of a pretty critical period of Japanese history, being set in Fedual Japan - so it's a lot for anyone to digest easily, so the only thing I can recommend is be patient.The casting is great. Besides Hiroyuki Sanada (who's awesome in pretty much everything he does), there's a few TV regular actors that have found their way into the show such as Nestor Carbonell and Louis Ferreria who are excellent actors. The protagonist is interesting John Blackthorne (played by Cosmo Jarvis - good acting by him so far) I don't really know how he will develop over the course of the show. It's a very different feel then say when Tom Cruise played Nathan Algren in The Last Samurai. It was pretty evident that Tom Cruise was going to be a Samurai, but with Shogun, it's hard to know how John Blackthorne fits in and I'm very curious and excited to see what happens.Whilst it's slated as a ""Mini Series"", I'm desperately hoping that we see it have far more than one season. In my mind it's conceivable that it could have many seasons based on how much effort they have gone to in this show thus far. It would be a waste to limit it to just one season - and it is seriously a lot of effort to do historical shows like this and to do them well.I'm waiting anxiously for episode three now. Personally they should have just put the whole season out and I would have happily binged the hell out of it.Fantastic show. I highly recommend it. 10/10.",10
"An orientalist, irrational and forced scenario and an overrated work","There is also an orientalist approach. There is a novel/screenplay based on a Westerner's perception of Japan/East. Japanese people who are willing to commit seppuku even for the slightest mistake, Japanese women who have no role in society other than serving men, Japanese teahouses and prostitutes; All of them are the image of Japan in the Westerner's mind. The most striking one is the harem image. Can you imagine that the Japanese, who are known to be extremely distant to foreigners, would give the widow of a high-ranking warrior as a wife to an unknown foreigner in the 1600s? Is it possible for the wife of a high-ranking warrior like Mariko to stay in the same house with a stranger they call Anjin? If anyone believes this, it means they don't have the slightest knowledge about Japan. The Western writer wrote the East of his dreams. A harem of Japanese women: a widow, a married woman, the house prostitutes, the teahouse's best prostitute, all serving a Western man! However, that Western sailor man has such superior morality that he falls in love with only one of them and does not want the others! This is all orientalism: The superior Western man establishes a harem in the East. You will sleep with the wife of the clan's best warrior, but you will not be killed, in 1600s Japan; This can only be laughed at.Really overrated. First of all, the script is very bad. Reality is not important, but fiction also has a logic. It is not understood why the council is only under Ishido's control and what power he has. Because even while Heir's mother was a hostage in Toranaga's hands; Ishido dominated the council. Why and how? No answer. If the council is not unanimous, it can't decide on Toranaga, but it did. The council that dismissed Toranaga could not decide on Anjin's death. This is ridiculous. Why did the priest act honestly and consistently? Did Toranaga tell his son to slip? Why didn't anyone attempt to assassinate Toranaga? Why didn't they let Mariko go? So mastermind Toranaga versus the council members who are all idiots, especially Ishido? Where does Toranaga's power come from, does he have no army other than Yabushige? Where are the other council members' armies? The script is terrible, there is no explanation.Therefore, the story cannot attract the audience. However, the clothes, the samurai, the expected twists, the anticipated big war, these always keep the interest alive. So, once again, an empty script survives with a flashy production. I think the reason why it is so exaggerated is the desire to establish a harem and advertising. A bad production that is not worth watching.",5
"Brilliant but Downwards ...","It has been proven in the past that the high potential of Japanese culture has made its way to the cinema and television of the worlds, and this series has reminded us of this just one more time what this culture has to offer.I've been waiting to see this series since I saw the trailer, which I think was worth the wait. In the first episode, saplings were planted, but the fruits of those saplings weren't seen in the final episode. At first, the viewer's expectations were very high; As much as the Japanese version of Game of Thrones, but at end it was not like that.In spite of the fact that media advertisements exceeded our expectations, it was a pleasant experience. Thanks for all.",8
"Amazing","After two episodes, this has me hooked. Great production value, good plot with a somewhat historical accurate depiction of the time. Haven't had that much from this perspective and it feels really well made.I kinda get the negative reviews about them not speaking Portuguese at all. It confused me as well at first.But I guess these people cannot think very far: the entire show would be subbed if they did not do that. Because no one spoke English in Japan back then. All they knew was Portuguese and here and there a bit of Spanish. Thanks to the missionaries from both countries.Try marketing a show that is subbed in its entirety to a Western / US audience. Good luck getting that green lit at all.Can't wait to see the rest of the show!",9
"SPEECHLESS PERFORMANCE","I have no words but wow i cant stop watching this 13 hours and some minutes .. Is worth watching.. Have it a 10 out of 10 makes you wonder about how much Japan has been through these National Distaster Earthquakes . Thats what gets me other places are lucky not to go through this and still they are so friendly... Anjin what a role he played not knowing how to speak the language but understand thats a beauty.. Great great im speechless and a must watch.. SHOWS TO TELL HOW WORDS CAN BE SOO powerful and its true from experience A Mans words can change the world and perspective of life . Till this day makes me wonder and think about Dec 7 1942 the real story... Theirs always 2 sides 2 a story.. ...

A fan.",10
"Fabulous","As a lover of the book I was slightly disappointed with the last TV adaptation. So I had my fingers crossed that this would be better. And better it is.What makes it better is the courage the makers showed in focusing on depicting a society so different from ours while trusting us to persevere through cultural differences that are not always easy to understand. Given that focus, John Blackthorn is less dominating as a character, with more time given to the Japanese characters. The love story with Mariko is still central, as Mariko herself is so fascinating.Those changes meant that this is even better than the book. A fabulous series.",9
"Best show of 2024!","I'm on episode 5 and I've been binging on this show all day. Lately I find myself unable to watch shows or movies without being bored and going on my phone and checking things out (sometimes even what next to watch ð³), but I have to say OH MY GOD this show is unreal ! I paused so I could write a review that's how good it is ! They don't make movies/ shows like this AT ALL anymore. The script, the acting, the cats, the story, the traditions, the culture, the history, the locality and dedication , the passion, the emotion. THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO FEEL AND SEE. Thank you SHOGUN. Thank you for the creators of Shogun.",10
"Finally! A one of a kind series","From the very first episode, this series captivates with its masterful storytelling, weaving a complex and intriguing narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The plot is rich in twists and turns, each one more surprising than the last, making it impossible to predict what will happen next.What truly sets this series apart is its exceptional action sequences, which are choreographed with precision and executed flawlessly. From heart-pounding chase scenes to intense battles, every action-packed moment is a visual feast for the eyes.Moreover, the historical atmosphere is meticulously crafted, transporting viewers to another time and place with stunning attention to detail. The sets, costumes, and props all contribute to the immersive experience, making you feel as though you've stepped back in time.But perhaps the most impressive aspect of this series is its directorial prowess. The frames are exquisitely structured, each shot carefully composed to maximize impact and evoke emotion. Every scene is a work of art in its own right, showcasing the director's unparalleled talent and vision.In summary, this series is a true masterpiece of intrigue, action, and historical drama. With its gripping story, breathtaking action, and impeccable direction, it's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates top-tier television. Prepare to be spellbound from beginning to end.",10
"Almost as good as the original","This is a very good show, from beginning to end. Cosmo Jarvis is no Richard Chamberlain, but he is good and adds a bit of comic flair to the role. Though something about his face, just isn't right for this role. Maybe it's because everytime I look at him I think there's going to be zombies appear as he has an uncanny resemblance to Rick, from the Walking Dead.Another bright spot in this version are Hiroyuki Sanada as Toranaga, and Tadanobu Asano as Lord Yabu. Both actors are amazing.One thing missing from this iteration is a prominent Vasco Rodrigues, the flamboyant English speaking Spaniard, who helps Blackthorne navigate the tricky world of the Japanese. John Rhys Davies' version in the original was a huge part of the show. Not so much this time around, and he is missed.Overall, this is still a very good show. It is culturally and historically accurate, even if it is filmed in Vancouver.",10
"Game of Thrones set in Japan","This is done very much on the wings of GoT's success and trying to cater to the same demand and don't let anyone tell you otherwise: fun, gory, lots of cloak-and-dagger politics. Fortunately set in a much more interesting setting, 1600 feudal Japan rather than some faux-medival Europe with dragons and murdering shadows. As a limited miniseries it also can't overstay its welcome, even if the ending is not very satisfying or cathartic and a tad bit anti-climactic. I don't know the source material so I'll reserve judgement on that but I was surprised to read it followed it closely and that the book was as nuanced and its focus wasn't solely on Blackthorne as it isn't in the miniseries. Cosmo Jarvis is a bit of a headscratcher: actively disliked his casting in the beginning, which might just have been due to his misshapen head or some odd pet peeve like that rather than his shouting performance, and not to say it is a good performance, but he did grow on me; the rest of the cast is pretty decent, Asano as Yabushige is the standout and the other two presences I liked most are Sanado and Hira as the two arch-rivals. All-in-all: well-written, well-produced, well-acted, and an entertaining way to spend 10 hours.",8
"Why the brilliant reviews?","I cannot understand why this show has such a high IMDB rating. It is ponderously slow with not a lot happening. I loved this book but this version isn't a patch on the book or the previous version. It's beautifully filmed with stunning scenery and amazing set design and settings but that's about its only positive.One of the major problems is that the actor playing the main character can't act. He delivers his lines in a tedious monotone showing little expression. This has had a huge impact on the entire production. His name is Cosmo Jarvis, they would have been better off with Cosmo Kramer.I have watched 6 episodes hoping it would get better but I won't be persisting any more. There is too much good stuff around.This is ridiculously overrated and isn't in the same class as numerous other shows with similar scores.",5
"ShÃ´gun","First of all, I expect this series to have a bloody war of course, it's fun to see war in this series. A few episodes in, they have what they call a ""war"" that is about to happen. The story of how the war starts is also the reason why I watched it. There was something called ""Crimson Sky"" where I knew it was going to be a bloody fight, but it wasn't what I was expecting. There hasn't been any serious bloody fighting here in the entire series, and it hasn't made me dissapointed in the entire series.After I watched and finished the whole series, I realized that something really happened in ""Crimson Sky."" It seems like the whole series has become a psychological war, it is important to understand and read the subtitle in this show and that will give a reason to understand whole the series.It became even more interesting in how it happened during the Edo feudal era of Japan. I gained a lot of knowledge about what traditional cultures Japan does.The whole series is amazing, I can't say enough about how beautiful the cinematography is, the whole script, the costume design, the performance of the actors.I'm happy to see Hiroyuki Sanada here, the role is perfect for him. I have also seen him in his role in the show Westworld, he is in the Shogun world, and his acting is great.",9
"Game of Thrones in Japan! Great!","The series is so different from what an American or European eye knows. On the other hand, it's also so familiar and incredibly good. It is precisely this Japanese stranger that makes this series so exciting The scenery and costumes in particular are incredible and chosen with great attention to detail. Shogun maintains its high standard and skillfully conveys the cultural peculiarities of Japanese culture at the time. I'm incredibly excited about the story without any prior knowledge, Disney is finally bringing out a somewhat new series. The subtitles are a little annoying, but I got used to them pretty quickly. Game of Thrones in Japan.",8
"The Heretic","The year is 1600. Having discovered a better sea route to the Orient, the Portuguese have established relationships with the Japanese, leading to advances in their two main objectives: profitable trade and the incursion of Catholicism into the region.A Dutch vessel, the Erasmus, beset by scurvy, drifts aimlessly through dense fog until it grounds near Osaka, where the crew is captured. They are treated badly. One sailor---an Englishman named John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis)---is sent to the castle as a prisoner, to be looked over. Fortunately for him, a young woman (Mariko, played by Anna Sawai) there speaks English, having been instructed by a Portuguese priest. Through her, he communicates with those in power, though they have little regard for this outsider.This is a time of political intrigue. A board of five regents is in charge, but some have designs on more power. And long histories of conflict color every decision, every posture. Blackthorne struggles to understand what is happening and how he might regain possession of his ship.Based on the James Clavell novel of the same title, this is an excellent mini-series. I admit I took to it slowly, as the narrative established the context for the entire series, but there was a moment near the end of the second episode when I was hooked by the story and I knew I would enjoy its entirety.Besides some strong acting, there is a strong element of design (costuming, sets, atmosphere) that infuses the production. But all is not beautiful, as there is death and brutality all around. Nevertheless, immersion into the culture of feudal Japan transports the viewer. We can identify with Blackthorne's struggle to understand his surroundings. At the same time, Western understanding of feudal Europe, with its warring factions and systems of fealty gives us an analogous example that allows basic comprehension from the beginning.This is an excellent story and a convincing glimpse into the history and culture of Japan in 1600.",10
"Going by the first 2 episodes. Loved it. My only complaints.","(Disclaimer, fan of the book and original series)
I feel like it has been slightly rushed, you don't really get a sense of time passing. Some of the story has been glossed over a bit and some of the side characters have become relegated to a cameo. They kinda just jump right into it. It's not necessarily a bad thing but I feel it's paced a bit quick and could be confusing to people new to the series. Perhaps a narrator would've helped? Some of the dialogue has been dumbed down a little and shortened. The prison scene should've also done a better job showing him being taught a little of the language and politics. Still, overall I'm hooked and can't wait to watch the rest :)",8
"Well done!","The visuals are stunning! The actors show their willingness to embrace their respect for the Japanese culture and time. What is skillfully woven and hidden is Toranaga's ruthlessness and cunning deception of his desire for ultimate power. If anything more emphasis should have been given to the conversations between and amongst the embattled clans. This could be contrasted with the exhanges with Toranaga's interactions with Blackthorne as he manipulates the truth of his intentions via Mariko. It is brilliant nevertheless. Mariko does not let on that she shares the vision of Toranaga until long after.",10
"Cosmo Jarvis is no fit for the role of John Blackthorne","I was surprised about how rather close to the book the story is told. The world building and the acting is really great. The story is told well and the spirt of the novell is captured really good.The japanese actors are cast perfectly and in accordance to the descriptions in the book. The only real flaw rom my point of view is that Cosmo Jarvis is neither blond nor blue eyed nor exactly tall. In no way he looks like a typical Englishman. There is an abundance of actors who would fit the description much better. I guess that the Hemsworth brothers would have been too costly but Dan Stevens for example or Rhys Ifans might have worked?",8
"Scratches that Political Drama Itch","Television programming in recent times often adopts a broader approach to appeal to a wider audience, resulting in a dilution of content characterized by reduced depictions of nudity, violence, and consequential themes. This tendency can sometimes equate to a superficial treatment that reminds me of a middle school history class, where subjects are overviewed without diving into the depth of their darker (or more romantic) aspects.Contrarily, ""Shogun"" distinguishes itself by fearlessly portraying the brutal realities amidst the captivating backdrop of a Japanese setting and culture, thereby infusing the narrative with an authenticity often lacking in most television programming.Moreover, the deliberate decision to retain all Japanese dialogue in its native language adds an immersive layer to the viewing experience. While this choice may polarize audiences, it effectively fosters a deeper connection with the central character, John Blackthorne. The show runners have however chosen to convey all spoken Portuguese as English.Through its initial episodes, ""Shogun"" unveils a rich tapestry of Japanese traditions, honor, political intrigue, and the encroachment of Western religion onto the Japanese landscape, offering viewers a compelling exploration of historical and cultural themes.I see the comparisons to Game of Thrones simply because people equate political drama to GoT, but I don't feel the comparison apt between the magical world of Westeros and that of Feudal Japan.",10
"Rare MASTERPIECE!... FINALY, REALISTIC ""Shinobi no mono""!","Usually a remake hardly is equal good with the original one - a film, a tv show, a song, etc...But sometimes, rarely... the remake is YEARS OF LIGHT MUCH BETTER than the original! That happen to me once, with the remake of ""Battlestar Galactica"" - ""SO SAY WE ALL!""...And now... with this rare MASTERPIECE!Obviously I have read the novel!And OBVIOUSLY I have watched the original short tv show. Yes, the original was also very gorgeous, amazing casting (all actors were magnificent), superb screenplay, battles, swords-fighting, etc.But this here, this new remake... is ""out of this planet""!!! If you have study the Japanese culture and History or at least if you LOVE them (as I do), you'll be enchanted!!!It has them all, as the original - and even far more better!!! The casting is great (okay, the original tv show had SUPERB actors of that era), the screenplay is very nice, the costume are gorgeous, the CGIs are fantastic, the scenes (landscape etc) are amazing, but the VERY STORY (scenario) is MUCH better than the original!In the original tv show, the English pilot ""Blackthorn"" (""Anjin"") was instantly adopted the Japanese ways, he was extremelly polite, the Japanese also accepted him very fast, etc.Here... the English pilot is... ENGLISHMAN! He cares for himself (mostly)! He has his own agenda, he wants to achieve his OWN PLANS, not simply ""obeying"" a foreign lord (Toronaga) just because he was unlucky and got shipless there!I LOVE how they portraited ""Blackthorn"", much much more better as it was in the original show.And... I was waiting... I was SUPER WAITING... to watch what I love (and study) more in Japanese History: ""SHINOBI NO MONO""!!!In the original tv show, we had TWO such scenes; one (very early) try to kill ""Anjin"" and another to kill Mariko. They were good, really good scenes in the original show.But here... oh boy! THEY NAILED IT!In the first try (attack) to ""Anjin"", they CHANGED it now and they had A FEMALE ""SHINOBI"" (""Kunoichi""!) - how many times have you ever actually watched a FEMALE ""Shinobi"" agent in action????? And most important, in 17th century's Japan (not modern ""Kunoichi"")!The second attack... the EPISODE #9... probably THE BEST of the entire season... was great till the last 15 minutes...
...and the last 15 minutes was SUPERNATURAL AMAZING!!! I had multiple... orgasms, by watching a (supposed, we never been there in 17th century's Japan) AMAZING REALISTIC infiltration of a large group of ""Shinobi no mono"" to a castle!No ""fancy"" clothes, no ""eccentric"" weapons, no ""bizzare choreography""... no. We watched PURE REALISTIC ""Shinobi"" agents, wearing DARK BROWN (!!!!!!!) simple clothing (with ribbons around their limbs), a SIMPLE piece of cloth covering their head and face (not ""fancy"" mask and cr@p!), they were holding USUAL AND SIMPLE weapons (""Katanas"", ""Kusarigama"", ""Shuriken"", etc) and they WERE NOT ""invulnerable"" (like Hollywood think about those agents) - several agents died in the proccess of the attack!!!...AMAZING tv show, AMAZING remake!Can't wait for the 2nd season - obviously those you haven't read the novel, you don't really think this is the end of it, right?The story is hardly in the MIDDLE of the novel!!!So of course it will be AT LEAST ONE MORE season!",10
"Not James Clavell's Shogun","Those giving such stellar reviews have either not read the book or seen the original miniseries which was very faithful to the novel. I'm watching this, but it is a chore... If I was not intimately familiar with the story, I would be hard pressed to follow the plot of this production. Yeah, it's pretty and all, great costumes, but none of the characters are believable in their acting, except maybe Lord Yabu. Mariko looks and acts like she just flew in from modern day Tokyo. And Buntaro? What? There is so much deviation from the book that they should have named it something else. I was really looking forward to this new series, but I'm totally disappointed.",2
"Beautiful","A masterpiece of acting and storytelling. Lessons in beauty, restraint, dedication and dignity. The acting is exquisite.What are the parallels to today's world? Culturally, we look at the opposite civilisation as the uncouth enemy and pour scorn on the other way of life.I rarely leave long reviews but having enjoyed this so much, I felt compelled to write somethingHoping it gets a second season but if it doesn't, that's almost better as this series leaves you feeling hurt but wanting more. But perhaps we have to learn from the Anjin and accept that we don't have to see and understand everything.",10
"Deviates from the book, in good ways...VISUALLY stunning","Deviations from the book like, some minor name changes, time changes (Mariko has a child now), added characters (Yabu's nephew), small stuff, which add the run time and gives the story a bit more color. Nothing that would make James Cavell roll over in his grave (RIP).This version of Shogun, so far, gives us more insight into Toranaga's thought process, which you only get from the book and not the early version of Shogun. All for the better, in my opinion.Mariko shows real emotions. Blackthorne has the same grit and determination. LOVE how spineless and manipulative they make the regents!This is a much gritter looking version of Shogun. Much more like what I would envision for a city of 1600 Japan.The first 2 episodes have been such a delight and promising. I hope they keep up the pacing and storyline.",9
"Authentic and Raw","The detail and accuracy of the time makes this an unforgettable watch, as well as the graphic depictions of warfare and violence. Characterisation is strong and makes you finding sympathy/apathy alike for the array of characters presented. It may be somewhat predictable in places, especially between the 2 main male/female leads, which is my only criticism, but otherwise this is a worthy series. Cosmo Jarvis is very watchable; enigmatic and carries himself through well despite the unfamiliar landscape and terrain. Over half way through and it seems to be heading for an epic showdown, that I hope is not predictable.",8
"House of Cards - Samurai style","When I checked the rating of this show. I was content, it reflects my view of the show as well.When I read some of the (negative) reviews, I was surprised.Sure, I haven't read the book. So I don't know if this is a perfect adaption.But on it's own it stands out as a House of Cards-style show that keeps you locked in from beginning to end of each episode.The intricacies of japanese politics, the clash and influence of outside religion and cultures, man.. it's just delicious to consume.If you're looking for a show that is packed with action and fighting. This is not the show.If you're looking for a show that makes you want to live in this japanese era, while also having moments of fun and action, don't miss out!",9
"Fantastic - cant read a word of the subtitles......","This is an excellently made series with high production values but it is a shame that the enjoyment is reduced because we cant read the subtitles without either one of us standing next to the screen or liberal use of the pause button. Viewing is interrupted with regular calls of ""what did that say"", ""rewind, I couldnt read it"". Alright, I am the wrong side of 50 and our TV set is only 40 inches but, still, making the subtitles a size that can be read would be a great help. I have no idea how people manage to understand what is happening if they are viewing on a mobile device. It spoils the experience greatly.",9
"Must watch. You won't be disappointed","Go in cold and don't watch any trailers, just have faith it will be good and you won't be disappointed. Beautiful and intense in equal measures, the whole cast and crew knocked this one out of the park. The casting and acting is spot on, stunning sets, backdrops and costumes with a perfect score to match the many different moods and emotions this rollercoaster will take you on. The story keeps you guessing and you never know which way it will turn getting more intense and intriguing with every episode that passes. The way they have brought this story and period of Japan to life is exceptional, and once I realised I wanted to binge the whole show, I waited until every episode was released first which is now a pleasure you already have available at your fingertips.Enjoy.",10
"Beautifully Done Except for One Thing","Because I am a fan of Hiroyuki Sanada, I was excited to see Shogun. Everything about the series is beautiful with one exception. Unfortunately, this one exception truly ruined the experience for me. Cosmo Jarvis was a bad choice to play Blackthorne. His acting in the series is painful to watch compared to the rest of the cast. Sometimes it seems like he is a petulant child with his mannerisms.Other than that, the rest of the cast does an excellent job. I don't mind reading subtitles, but in the streaming version, you can watch
English-dubbed episodes. There is a lot of graphic violence; however, parts of Japanese culture seem rather violent. Overall, the cinematic experience is definitely worth watching.",8
"Excellent start based on James Clavell's historical novel","What a good start FX's (seen on Disney+) has made. Based on the 1975 novel by James Clavell, this story is based around the real life experiences of English sailor William Adams (John Blackthorne in book and series), a Royal Navy veteran, who became the first Englishman to reach Japan, and his rise to influence.With Spain and Portugal the great sea powers of the 1500s, Japan was little known, incredibly difficult to navigate to and closely guarded by the Catholic states, who were on a quest for riches. After the English defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, the Dutch and English, Protestant nations, allied against Spain and so Adams (Blackthorne) finds himself on a Dutch ship trying to open trade routes to Asia.From the outset this series takes us into 16th century Japan, in culture, language, politics, rivalry and intrigue. It's an excellent tale of differing cultures and beliefs conflicting but also merging, from Japan's rich heritage and tradition to the Catholic church's influence, not to mention the early antagonism between Protestant and Catholics.The story is rich, the production values, sets and locations excellent. We are only two episodes in, but one hopes the current standard in script and production continue.",9
"Beautifully shot but falters on casting and fidelity to the source material","Shogun is propably most notable book of late James Cavell. In time of it's publishing it was surprisingly well acceptepted even by japanese, by how well it incaptured this mysterious culture. Then comes this atrocity. Understandably some libertties need to be taken when adapting a book into a movie or tv series, but these choises done here, not only they deviate from the source material, they do it in a fashion that makes absolutely no sense. Like no sense at all. Some conversations are made totally redundant for no reason, for instance when Blackthorne explains Netherlands insurrogance against their rightfull sovereign. In a book and in 80's series it was depicted in a way that made sence. And my biggest grievance is Blackthorne. Who in their right mind thought that dead-eyed ding dong like Cosmo Jarvis was a good choice for the lead role. That's totally inexcusable. That man has zero range, he would be better of playing some football hooligan than a 1600-century pilot, whom by should be one of the better educated people in the world. In the book he has his problems coming adjusted with japanese culture but he actually learns, beacuse he's smart. Not only language but culture. And he learns how to navigate the dangerous waters of japanese in house fighting of 1600-century. Cosmo Jarvis depicts a moron who actually learns few words of japanese but absoluteli insists on being a moron and stuck to his ways. Richard Chamberlain wasn't perfect Blackthorne in 80's series, but at least he could act, Cosmo Jarvis absolutely cannot. People who are giving this one 10/10 must not have actually seen this depiction.",5
"Impressive","Considering that 44 years ago was the last and the series which can be considered, it seems a bit not sufficient. It could be much better.Toshiro Mifune acted perfectly at that time as Toranaga. Hiroyuki Sanada deserves the role in this series and I believe, at this time there is no actor could play it better than him.Cosmo, sorry to say, is completely out of the subject. No talent at all, he didn't act as for the 17th century but for actual days. Anna Sawai played greatly whit small exceptions when she didn't let the action to flow.If will be a second season, hope they will continue this great work and the scenario will bring some more action for the hungry public.",8
"Very good ð","I am admiring the serie so much due to its captivating story and good acting of Japanese actors.The serie depicts a nice historical decade of international expansion governed by Portugal and Spain , as well as their conflict with Great Britain to master the lands and divide them.The hero of the serie acted talently to show the character potential and inteligence to save his life and the Japanese kingdom. He adapted the Japanese political rules and traditions cleverly.The sences were fascinating and the cast was chosen wisely and reflects the Japanese culture. The custumes as well were designed perfectly and the colors used described the Japanese culture, traditions and it showed each character rank in the society.",9
"Sputtered to an end","Good story well acted. High quality production cinematography was first rate, but the ending was abrupt. Expecting a Season 2 and evidently that is it. I was reading an old copy of the book and it is 1200 pages in total. I expected something more but that is it. I will not wade thru 900 more pages to reach this end..The old cheap copy I had was crumbling as it was CA 1975. In the woodstove it goes or in the trash. Clavell wrote several novels in different periods set in the far east
I saw the old series years ago with Chamberlain. I didn't remember it's ending. Maybe it wasn't memorable. My review was deemed too short. Maybe this series was too short inadequate or unfinished. I get it. Toranaga becomes Shogun. That was his plan all along. Mariko was supposed to force the hands of the council by dying. His old pal who committed suicide was to do that in protest when it seemed T had given up It was all a subtle ploy. It played out with scarcely a ripple and the story ended with a whimper. I am very chagrined it did..",8
"Anna Sawai almost ruins yet another series with her terrible acting","First, let's say that the screenplay is great; the character development is stellar; and the production quality is delightful. Three stars right away. Now, the acting: Cosmo Jarvis does his best to merge James Purefoy and Richard Burton together, even though he's still pretty annoying throughout the series. Maybe it's the way the role is/was written? Fine. Hiroyuki Sanada is brilliant, maybe the perfect actor for this production/role available today. Owns every scene he is in, for sure. Both Moeka Hoshi and Fumi NikaidÃ´ are excellent in their roles, too; it's a shame these two fine talents were relegated to the side because of the terrible miscasting of Anna Sawai in the lead role. She was terrible in the Monarch series on AppleTV+, and she was terrible in this amazing role. That's one star down, for sure, because everyone seems to be afraid to criticize her for whatever reason-but she totally prevented this audience from even caring about her character, despite the tragic writing. Hoshi and NikaidÃ´ steal every scene they're in; Sawai ruins every scene she's in. Other than Sawai, pretty much every other actor in this series nails their respective role. So that's 5 stars there. The only other negative? The silly final 15 minutes where the ""outcome"" is reduced to exposition of the future, like this was the ""Twilight"" finale or something. Did they run out of money/time? Just a lame way to end a fantastic series-maybe cut a little of the fringe from the first 5 episodes, and there would have been more time for a properly developed and explored ending ... instead of just spoon feeding the political intricacies to the audience. Weak ending, sadly. Definitely a watchable series, but Sawai and the finale's ""finale"" really hurt the overall rating. #facts.",8
"Well done / Joaquin Pavon","Absolutely outstanding. It really encapsulates the political, relational, and religious turmoil of that period. Each of the actors had become iconic in their own right. I think the most enjoyable way to experience this TV show is by watching it in its original language. After noticing its high rating, I stumbled upon this show. While the first 30 minutes were a bit slow, I'm grateful that I stuck with it because it kept improving and getting better as it progressed. The directors, writers, and producers were clearly knowledgeable in their craft. They had done their research and demonstrated a deep understanding of the art of storytelling.",10
"Season 1: 9/10","The show nailed the setting of 17th century Japan and pulled you straight into this world right from episode 1. Beautiful cinematography and editing (some of it was pure ASMR). The production design and costumes were amazing. Japanese culture, customs and their beliefs portrayed were fascinating. The attention to authenticity right down to the gestures and movements was truly impressive.The writing was very good. The dialogues, humor and emotional scenes, themes like death and fate, the politics and schemings, character arcs and of course the large ensemble of unique and fascinating characters. My favorites were:Toranaga:
Cold and constantly scheming and manipulating his subordinates as well as enemies to fulfill his plans. Wonderfully acted by Hiroyuki Sanada.Yabushinge:
Funny and sly, obsessed with death, willing to back stab anyone as his loyalty belongs only to himself and his self preservation. Wonderfully acted by Tadanobu Asano.Fuji:
Cute and funny. Hiding immense grief behind her eyes, mentally strong enough to carry on her duty to her Lord. The most likeable character in the show.John Blackthorne:
His character really grew on me as the show went on. His character arc was beautiful.Notable mentions: Mariko, Lady Ochiba (wonderfully acted, her creepy eyes and her voice), Omi and so many other side characters. My favorite aspect of this show were its characters.Would have loved to see more action at the end (my only gripe with the finale, but I think the neatly tying up of the characters and their arcs almost made up for it). What action was shown was good, which was usually sudden and violent. The good score helped set the tension and shock in many scenes.I will miss many of these characters. Hope season 2 maintains the quality of this season.",9
"It is what you'd expect from the trailer!","It's not uncommon to watch a trailer and go ""wow, thats good"", and have your heart broken and your dreams shattered, and to have a complete desperation for your future as a human being, and you question your reality and the hours you put in cheap entertainment, wasting precious time without your kids and your pets, when you finally see the work advertised. Well, this is not it.So far, this series is extremely well written, extremely well acted, extremely shot, extremely scored... I mean, if you're repeating extremely a lot on a sentence, you should use it on your rating... so, there you have it: 10/10.If you like samurai stories, love stories, war stories, foreign stories... if you like GOOD STORIES, you should watch this show.",10
"Excellent TV!","Haters gonna hate. Not sure what people are expecting anymore! We get a a very intriguing series that has an amazing build up they bash it, wanting more action and more ""brightness"". Ever saw a review that it is not for ""English"" speaking audience. My guy!!! We want authenticity in a series, feel immersed. You can actually read the subtitles. We get an action series people want a more slow and interesting series.Just do your self a favor and watch this TV masterpiece! Would i want more ""fights""? Sure, but the build up was too sweet to care about a 5-10 mins huge battle than never happened. It needs the proper build up that will lead into a battle. We need to become familiar with the characters and know their stories. It's a complex series!",10
"Build up only to let you down hard!","If this wasn't the biggest deception in TV series history, then I don't know what is. This show rode on the idea of a Shogun. In Japanese folklore, a Shogun was a very powerful military commander who was second to only the Emperor and he commanded a large army. And if you controlled the army, you almost nearly are in control of the country. So when this dude, Toranaga, who comes from a long line of Shoguns, is exiled and on the verge of being killed by the then rulers of Japan, we are taking on this journey of discovery. Will he become Shogun and take on these rulers? And if he won't, then what will be do?After a long wait which spanned 9 episodes of boring, long speech, great cinematography and excellent acting we are presented with a poorly written, incredibly dissatisfying ending. Honestly it felt like we, the viewers, were the ones the trick was played on. There was no Shogun, there was no grand battle, there was no ""crimson sky"", there was no justice served, and the only deaths were those of his loyal followers who sacrificed themselves, all for what?!If not for the amazing scenes, cinematography and acting, I would have given this a 3/10. The story just sucked big time.",6
"Really don't get the compliments for this","Its beautiful and the set design and costumes are amazing.The Japanese actors do the best they can with the boring dialogue they are given.That's the only good things I can say about this. It does not deserve high ratings. Don't waste your time.Blackthorn is horribly cast - not the slightest bit believable as a tall Englishman nor physically different looking enough from the Portuguese to stand out to the Japanese as the reason why they let him live, unlike the novel. He is also a poor actor.And what is with the accent, or accents I should say as the actor cannot stick to one. Horrible. I could not believe he was a British actor. I'm English and I have never heard anyone sound like that including when acting in period pieces.",5
"This show is a love letter to the original author, James Clavel","Shogun is my favourite Book and IÂ´ve got to say I am absolutely in awe about how good this series turned out to be. The amount of detail, incredible cast, costume design, each episode quality-wise on par with top of the line AAA movies.This series feels like one of those projects made out of love and passion, I cannot imagine something so beautifully crafted, with such a high level cast, being profitable. The show's commitment to authenticity is evident in every detail, from the intricate costumes to the elaborate set designs, transporting us to a world that feels both ancient and alive. Certainly, they mustÂ´ve invested so much into this series to achieve such a masterpiece.",10
"For the 1st two episodes, it's ""Shogun"", thereafter it's ""Blackthorne and Mariko""","The first two episodes were great and some of the best TV I had watched in the last couple of years. But, as it progressed, the show started to diverge away from the best aspects of the show- the feud and the politics. Now, the whole show has turned into a romance drama revolving around Blackthorne and Mariko. Things pertaining to Shogun are in the backdrop. I had to fast forward 5-10 minutes of an episode last week out of boredom. That's how stretched out the later episodes feel compared to the first two.I hope the next episodes would be better but have a feeling this will feel more and more like a family drama.",8
"As of episode 5","This is the best TV I've seen in 30 years. I've watched plenty, I'd call it close to the first season of game of thrones in terms of the drama, and it does so well without the use of any trauma triggering action. The pace is perfectly done, character development is perfectly paced, characters act as you'd expect the to. The visuals are fantastic; I've not noticed any obvious animation but your experience may well vary. The actors are consistent in character and very well believe able, the anterarge is gripping! I very nearly over looked this and I am so thankful I did not, definitely the best show in the last couple of years, though I stand by my earlier comment of all my experience.",10
"An epic story!","There's a lot going on in Shogun, yet it doesn't distract you instead keeps you engaged right till the big payoff in the end. Seeing the anjin's shock at the culture in Japan and how different it was to where he comes from is a delight, the there's relationship with Mariko and the tension that builds with each episode and ultimately blooms in episode 9. That was the delightful payoff, though it's sad she dies in the same episode after escaping certain death in the same episode! For most of the series Mariko was bound by duty and her her marriage, you could tell Buntaro was a burden as she sleeps with the anjin after she thinks he's dead ( they tried but we all know it was her ). This was preceded by the hot tub scene were they got really intimate and is probably the best interaction they had. Phew I've talked a lot about Mariko and the anjin and that's mostly because their relationship is arguably the most interesting thing on the show and Mariko herself is the most engaging character, she will be missed. Asides both of them Toranaga is a man you just can't figure out, he's always planning something and it makes you wonder what his desires truly are. I think Yabushige understands him better than anyone especially before his death and Toranaga sees a bit of himself in Yabushige. His nephew Omi is a great character so is Ochiba no kata. Toranaga's son may not have been the brightest but he had courage and led with his heart, his actions also gave Toranaga another card to play.The story is fine where it ended, I'm strongly against a season 2 and 3 but since it's happening, Ochiba will definitely play a big part, her heir too, there might be a time skip. I can't wait to see what happens.",10
"Shogun Book versus Show","I would have given it a 10, except I am so tired of people taking great books and changing them when the go to the screen. Please keep them the same.. that's why they were highly rated books. The did the same thing with Lessons in Chemistry.After reading Shogun which was close to 1600 pages, I was very excited to see the show. Then was disappointed when complete storylines were switched around.The show is still very entertaining and amazing acting. They did a wonderful job with sets and costumes.I would still recommend watching the series because it's very worthwhile.Definitely for an older group not for young children.",9
"Finally, New Ideas for TV!","I do know that Shogun is based on a book and a previous miniseries but at this era of television it does feel authentic. This is really what this genre needed. I know a lot of people are comparing it to Game of Thrones but it is mainly because most fantasy and historical shows in recent years have failed badly not because these two shows are alike. Shogun can be like Game of Thrones in the sense that it would be the next big thing in TV.The first two episodes were really great. The pacing is absolutely brilliant. It keeps you entertained, provides enough information gradually, and does not bore you at all. Although there are a lot of subtitles but they even made that fun in some scenes like the first conversation between the Anjin and Toranaga where the interpreter is removed from it. Also, almost all the characters are portrayed beautifully by the actors and everything seems real and believable. The production and cinematography is quite good as well.I really have high hopes for the show and believe it can mark its name among the greatest shows of TV if it keeps getting better to the end and it apparently will. My only problem would then be the fact that it is said to be a miniseries and we won't get more seasons.",10
"Blown Away!!!!","Blown away! If you have any facet in your soul for culture and not some white washed bs then def check it out. The amount of detail that has been put into this show is astonishing. From the clothing to the way that people move and everything in between is unbelievably on point to the era this show is in. Love the fact that most of the show is in Japanese with subtitles makes you feel in the time period. Don't listen to the idiots that give this a low number. They can go watch the bachelor/bachelorette and continue to be a sheep. If they cancel this show after a season it's a complete travesty to entertainment. Thank you for something different!!!!!!!",10
"Amazing series, if you're not dumb","Seen the reviews complaining about subtitles. You people don't even deserve the luxury of seeing decent film. Grow up. If you're reading comprehension cannot keep up with movie subtitles thats on you. How you even wipe your own dumb fat ass?I'm betting all negative reviews re subs are America. Its not offensive, its just true in 2024. Why are some of you so ignorant and poorly educated? My immigrant friends with poor english can still manage to keep up with Eng sub'd films. Everyone here in Australia, UK, Europe, Canada we all enjoy subb'ed films. Because we're adults and educated to an acceptable degree. What is going on in US public schools? Seems to be just daycare.To complain about the best series this year like that is disqualifying. To all others who have read at least one book, just watch this without knowing anything. Its 100% quality.",9
"Meh.","I'm on episode four. The show just about continues to hold my attention. The main character, Blackthorne drives me to despair. A thoroughly unlikeable prat whose actions and attitude would more likely get him killed in the Japan of that era. The dialogue doesn't feel authentic either, and makes it difficult to remain immersed in the story world.I could easily quit this show, but I will persevere for another episode and maybe even trudge through to the bitter end, which judging by other reviews, doesn't sound too promising.For me, the Korean drama ""Alchemy of souls "" was far superior, even if it isn't quite comparing the same genre.",5
"The philosophical journey of an English seapilot in Japan","I expected disappointment and I was rewarded with one of the best shows on the little screen, no contest ! THe cultural opening is mind-blowing and yet shows how close we all are.Some compared it to Game of thrones, the political plots are very much on the same level, but viewed by an Englishman completely out of his depth. The japanese culture is on some points aberrant from the start but he is warned by a catholic sailor that he will come to see its beauty if he lives long enough.Fans of books or nostalgia, or long battles will be disappointed. Open-minded newcomers will be delighted. I suspect that's why it HAD to be filmed in Japanese in the first place. The parts in english, are supposed to be in Portuguese, which our ""pirate"" speaks but ..that would be impractical, nevertheless, we are in his shoes often enough : lost in translation..I very much never understood the Japanese culture new or old, but we deal with the new, or why people would seek it until this Series. It's not what i want for my people ever. But just like the Anjin I came to understand a few things, that beauty he was warned about and like him, i didn't change my mind, but I for sure gained a lot of respect for it that I didn't have before thanks to that series.Many bad reviews come from wildly stereotyped visions, I'm glad we avoided those.The bottomlime is that the english pirate learned and we do not.N. B.Some cultures matter more, I guess double A-bombing a small Island is how we trade better in peace and respect. Colonisation all but wiped out the unwritten history of three continents. Asia, Mesopotamia, Middle-East are however rich as historical documents go. A good narration could teach a lot about differneces without offending too many people. Any grounbreaking movie/series nowadays are the ones that aren't blindsided by old propaganda.",9
"Utterly Stunning","Its so rare these days to find an incredibly written series with such character depth. So often we're fed what to think and how we should feel but Shogun lets us explore with the characters and immerse ourselves in an unknown world, like Anjin himself.Lady Mariko's character is outstanding, so outstanding that her presence was missed in episode 10. An exemplary use of a strong female role but without the clumsy stereotypes that have crept into modern writting of such characters.Theres are too many positives to list them all but this is a must watch series for all. I just hope they leave this be and let it mature into an all time great instead of creating multiple prequels and sequels.",10
"Nothing short of perfect","Ive been on IMDB for many years, yet this is the first time I actually decided I need to comment and rate a show.I know sometime taste are subjective. And it is a possibility that some people don't appreciate this show as much as it deserve.But I have never watched a show where every episode is perfect, except this one.Every new episode, I am completely shocked. And I am not talking about cliffhanger and can't resist binging the serie. In fact, this show pretty much requires some time in between episode. I've experience every emotion watching this. I loved characters, cheered for them, hoped for them, despised some...This is the only show I have ever given a 10 and I don't think I will ever again.",10
"Yes, I get he's a pirate but.....","He doesn't have to speak like one!The Anjin's Long John Silver accent is really grating. Overemphasising every enunciation in a ""smokes 60 a day"" growl is wearing! I keep expecting every sentence to end ""har har young fellow me lad""!That aside, it's a gripping & intriguing! I am only half way through but the political manoeuvring alongside the delicate societal dances that the characters go through to not cause offence or give an indication of true feelings means you can't take your eyes off it.It is beautifully shot has enough ongoing action & twists to ensure each episode flies by.More of the Shogun & less of the pirate please! Arr Harr!",9
"Great show","Shogun i a great show. I really liked the authenticity of the characters speaking Japanese, which significantly heightens immersion. However, the experience could be further enriched if conversations in various European languages were portrayed in their native tongues rather than solely in English. It feels somewhat incongruous when characters reference speaking Portuguese, for instance, yet converse in English. Similarly, the discrepancy is noticeable when Dutch sailors communicate in English aboard their merchant vessel. This inconsistency stands out, especially when contrasted with the meticulousness of the Japanese content.Despite only viewing a few episodes, the portrayal of scenes and the performances of the cast lend credibility to the narrative. The attention to detail in set design and costume, coupled with convincing performances, creates an immersive viewing experience. The characters feel authentic, and their interactions contribute to the overall believability of the story. Each scene unfolds with a sense of realism, drawing the audience deeper into the world of feudal Japan.",8
"very well done so far","As someone who lived in Japan, learned a fair bit of Japanese and is somewhat familiar with Japanese history, this series is a pleasure to watch. I appreciate that most of the dialogue is in Japanese, capturing authentic cultural aspects in detail.I like that the series doesn't gloss over the violence and difficulties of the feudal era or the power of the samurai class over peasants and farmers. And the series captures the European colonial powers' efforts to subjugate Japan, using religion as a weapon of influence. The series I hope will show how Japan, uniquely, was mostly able to rebuff and contain those efforts, absorbing technology and knowledge for their own purposes while modernizing rapidly.",10
"Very very good , was mind blowing .","Wow , now this is something , i am speechless , i never read the book but the costumes , the plot and the acting are flawless , very good actors , from the historic point of view it brings you back in that era very easy . I loved every second of these 2 episodes .To tell u the truth i was never so hooked to a series but this one is different , it was that good , it takes very big efort to acheive such perfection . I would've give 11 stars if it was possible , i realy liked Breaking Bad and Sopranos but this one is way better , i look forward for this masterpiece , hopefully the rest will be as good as the first two . 2 quality hours i spend this year .",10
"Just not as enjoyable as I hoped","I saw the original Shogun with Richard Chamberlain and though not the best depiction of Japanese culture, it was enjoyable to watch. This remake was less enjoyable. Starting with the muted tones and sometimes difficult to follow dialog, the characters are less than engaging. There are only three standouts, Mariko, of course. The story was more hers than Toranaga's to me. Yasbushige was another standout and Lady Ochiba.Overall, it was just lot of long sad scenes, with exposition. The worst character was Blackthorne. Nothing about the character or the actor's portrayal endeared me to his plight. All in all, a beautiful look into Japan but a less than enjoyable story.",6
"Great visually-","-well acted by a fabulous cast and superb settings. But by the ending? Meh- totally let it down. It left so much hanging in the air.I am a devotee of the book- and read the biography of Will Adams even before the 1980 series came out.I loved the realism of the towns and villages in this one- but good as the cast were- the original cast were just as good. I felt cheated by the end of this new series. There was-for me- an empty hole where the heart of the story should have been.It began well- but got weaker for me every episode.I rewatched the 1980 version-and enjoyed it immensely. It was dated for sure- and far too clean and tidy- but the characters told a richer and ultimately more satisfying story.I wouldn't re-watch this version.",5
"Up there with the best TV shows","After the first two episodes of Shogun, I can say the quality of the show is up there with some of the best, like Game of Thrones and Band of Brothers. This show is so rich and authentic within the Japanese culture at around the 1600s, that it's got me wanting to learn Japanese now! I love how the Japanese have such intricate customs and traditions alongside technological innovation. How they highly value respect and honor above all else. Now, there is a double edged sword for an American audience here, because all of the Japanese actors speak in the Japanese language for the primary audio and the Portuguese language is spoken in English for the English audience to connect with as it makes you feel like a complete outsider when journeying into japan for the first time with the English sailor. I believe this is a good thing as having the Japanese speak English would have taken away a lot of the exotic/foreign mystery of the Japanese represented here and the english audience wouldnt feel as much like a foreigner when watching the Japanese in the show . So if you hate reading subtitles they do fortunately offer an English dubbed version on Hulu, along side the original audio for the show version. I implore anyone who doesn't like reading subtitles to please give the primary audio version with spoken Japanese a try, as it really adds to the story and creates a heightened sense of awareness and concern for the English sailor's survival, because it makes the Japanese here feel much more foreign and ""exotic"" here. Thanks!",10
"Shogun: A Beacon of Historical Storytelling Excellence.","""Shogun"" stands as an unequivocal masterpiece, showcasing impeccable production design and dynamic cinematography that vividly resurrects the Japan of the 1600s. The series dazzles with stellar performances and creative, mature writing that seamlessly intertwines action, drama, and cultural exploration. It navigates the intricate realms of politics, power dynamics, magalomania, warfare, honor, sacrifice, loyalty, and treachery, all while paying profound homage to Japanese customs, traditions, and values. Each episode maintains an electrifying intensity, offering viewers a refreshing and immersive historical narrative. Despite the absence of big war sequences, ""Shogun"" captivates with its expansive portrayal of the political machinations among Japanese rulers. Even with most dialogues being in Japanese, audiences effortlessly connect with and comprehend the intricacies of the narrative. In sum, ""Shogun"" triumphs as a beacon of historical storytelling excellence, leaving viewers eagerly awaiting its second season.",10
"Although the series' cultural and political foundation is impressive, something doesn't quite fit.","Half of the series is about political maneuvers and power struggles, while the other half focuses on Japanese culture, a foreigner's struggle to fit into this culture, and eventually becoming alienated from himself. The cultural aspect satisfied me.It handles the mind games and political chess much better than the average work in today's culture. The series avoids the clichÃ© or cheap tactics often seen in other shows, such as the main character pulling meaningless rabbits out of a hat by the end. In fact, it handles these aspects in a highly sophisticated manner. However, it still doesn't quite come together. While the political aspect seems well-planned, it involves too many risky moves for outcomes that aren't guaranteed. There's a high possibility of unexpected developments and the main character's grand plan could easily backfire.Also I would have liked the action part to be stronger. Towards the end of the series, I expected the tension built up in the audience to be released with some action. However, the last episode wasn't the tipping point I hoped for. In fact, I think it was one of the weakest episodes of the series.Finally, the series kills off many of its characters. This means we'll meet many new characters in the upcoming seasons. However, since we didn't see these characters in the first season, they will likely feel like they dropped from the sky.",8
"The English again","It's a good show but as a european watcher i feel like every single historical tv show nowadays depicts the English under a good light. It becomes tiresome, and it is biaised, so would be nice if the studios hear that voice one time, that it would have been a good opportunity to have a more unusuale and international vibe and to know more about the portugal / japan partnership gor example rather than involving these perpetual English characters. Make english the spoken language, that's not the point, the point is to show something different historically speaking. Apart from that the show is enjoyable, thank you for producing it.",8
"Great! Shame about the Blurry backgrounds and bottom of screen!","Awesome series as mentioned by other reviewers. But for me, spoilt by the frequent blurry backgrounds and bottom of screen. I understand this is because of the specific camera lens that they have used. For me it was far too distracting. In one scene, the corners of the screen are curved like CCTV footage!!Apart from the spoilt visuals, the story is very gripping with great characters, a little bit like Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.Definitely worth watching and one of the best series I have seen. Can't wait for the next series!I'm not sure why they used those lenses to film this, there are online posts that go into it.",8
"Just watched the pilot (no pun intended)","I first read this book last year, and tried to watch the early movies which came out a few decades back. I was so excited to learn about this show, and when i finally watched it, I was not disappointed. Amazing first episode! Great casting, great videography and music.True to book as much as possible for a TV show. Truly captures the intricacies of medieval Japanese culture, with the Sepukku being an uncomfortable but important aspect. I do wish that greater attention wouldve been given to the vile treatment of the serf villagers by their overlords, but overall excellent show and im excited to watch the next few episodes. Also, no dumb political agendas as of yet!!",10
"When it always rains you wanna kill yourself","The show looks very authentic. With culture, art, combat, rituals etc. Just well written and well told. The actors are convincing. It occurred to me that it must be raining a lot in Japan and people had the tendency to want to commit seppuku (ritual suÃ¯cide). That let to misery and again people who want to commit suicide because their loved ones also did.The story starts when Europeans sailed all over the world to trade and conquer. The asians, in contrary to the africans and Americans, were not that easy to submit. The asians made sure that they were the ones who made the terms. At this time the ruler dies of old age, the successor is too young so 5 regents are put into place to rule till he is 16. Offcourse this goes wrong and the struggle starts.",8
"Fantastic","Working to research the historical accuracy of this story however, it has been extraordinary so far. The emotion captured through the attention to detail keeps you locked-in. This atypical viewpoint on religion elicits convicting thoughts and is a sober orientation for audience to a time where law, sovereignty, and self-interest were approached in a more primal and, perhaps, barbaric manner. Furthermore, this story shines light on just how domesticated the Catholics in Japan were. Grasp of the language, hair and clothing, and peculiar cultural norms are clearly adopted and practiced by the colonial Christians.I will be supplementing this as I learn more-excited to see this unfold!",9
"Sorry not sorry, I was frustratingly bored with this","And I'm usually not an impatient viewer. I've seen slow burns and quiet drama without getting bored many times, but for some reason I just couldn't get through this one. I just didn't care about any of the characters and didn't feel like I understood the culture we are presented with here.The only entertaining character was the Portuguese guy, but he disappeared after the third episode or so. Nestor Carbonell is excellent and I've always wondered why he hasn't grazed the big screen more.The Japanese actors all did a great job, but there's just too much stoicism from them. The main Japanese characters just don't show enough emotions and many of the scenes are dragged out too much.I seriously have trouble understanding why this show has such a high rating as it has, but to each their own.",5
"I cannot wait any longer to rate this!","Shogun's first episode catched my interest. Shogun's second episode overwhelmed me.Shogun's third episode confirmed my greatest hope.This epic tale is a huge addition to the genre of historical dramas. It has great writing, brilliant atmosphere and music, loveable characters, amazing set pieces and costumes, satisfying action and a maturity long missed in Disney productions.The show reminds us of Game of Thrones itself, while in the same time standing on its own feet.I wanted to wait for the show to complete before reviewing it, but after the third episode I am certain my expectations will be fulfilled. My connection to the characters already feels like a strong bond and I am that intrigued to the story I want to binge the remaining episodes immediately.Without doubts I hereby call Shogun by the name it deserves: Masterpiece.",8
"Pure and cultural","""Shogun is a captivating series that excels in every aspect. The acting is phenomenal, with each actor bringing depth and authenticity to their roles. The leading actress delivers a standout performance, making her character both compelling and relatable. The cinematography is breathtaking, with stunning visuals and expertly crafted scenes that immerse viewers in the historical setting. The screenplay is well-written, blending drama, intrigue, and cultural insight seamlessly. Overall, Shogun is a masterfully crafted series that offers a rich, engaging viewing experience.""
I really suggest to watch this serious.",10
"As a stand alone show","The acting in this show is very good. There are some actors that are at different levels of their careers for sure, but overall the performances are excellent. The writing is for the most part very good, but I do wish sometimes they would slow down a little bit. I think sometimes they try to ""deliver"" and it comes at the cost of a more fleshed out story. This show has so many different nuances going on sometimes it can be a bit much to just ""enjoy"" I'm not familiar with the other versions of this story so it's a lot to take in at first. But with each episode the story does come together. A week between episodes does require a recap. I honestly thing all the bad reviews are quite harsh and not deserved. There are a lot of mediocre shows on these days. This is a big step up in quality.",9
"Credit due.","It's good to see Hiroyuki Sanada finally get cast into a starring role on a very well made series. He definitely earned it. As far as the series goes, everything about it so far has been top notch. The authenticity goes above and beyond. I could almost smell the stank coming from the English sailors through my television as they were removed from the prisoner holding pit after being taken off of their vessel. There was also a seen where one of their Japanese captors cut a villagers head off. It happened super fast and I wasn't expecting it. It looked so real that it left me speechless. The only thought going through my mind was ""Daaaaaaamn!"" I had to rewind it several times trying to figure out how it was done.",10
"So good!","Loved, loved, loved it. I know the book has been covered but please can we have more ...The series was fantastic and totally engrossing. Characterisation was perfect, setting superb and the whole series gives so much insight into the Japanese psychi.So much better than a previous adaptation (which was awful and nothing like the book).What a build up ... to finish the way it did! The book was huge. It seems unbelievable it could be translated into just 10 episodes.Best series we have watched for ages. I was a bit concerned about Blackthorne but was left feeling assured and wanting more.Well done to all concerned!",10
"Sho Far Sho Good!","Sho Good!Sho far, this is shooo good. Quality of this show is amazing and I can't wait to watch each new episodes. I wish I didn't need to wait every week for this.Shogun has the potential to be one of all time great shows. I am sure people compare to GOT, which is somewhat true with all the backstabbing, battles, some sexual fantasies, heroes and villains, etc.Getting more in depth to Japan's time period when foreign influence/invasion occurred seems like a great time period to get us interested. Several attempts to invade Japan has always been unsuccessful in History while we know Japan invading other Asian countries in the early 1900s were well documented.Sho excited for next episodes!",10
"A fantastic miniseries!","This show is the first in a very long time to equal the quality of the first 4 seasons of Game of Thrones. From the writing, acting, production and music, every aspect is firing on all cylinders.The GOT comparison feels appropriate since this show is heavily focused on character and political intrigue. The writers expertly construct a complex web of plotting and scheming, driven by equally complex and riveting characters. The plot keeps you guessing through every episode, with small details having major significance and every action having major consequences. No character is safe and mistakes are costly. This is all enhanced by riveting dialogue scenes and excellent character subtleties.Of course, every actor gives it their all. There is no weak link in the cast and every actor is able to convey their character's complex emotions and feelings with just small changes in facial expressions. Cosmo Jarvis, Hiroyuki Sanada, Fumi Nikaido and especially Anna Sawai are all standouts.From a technical standpoint, this show is spectacular. Sets are amazing, cinematography is spectaclular and the music is perfect. There is action, but it's used sparingly and is done very well. The culture and the world are wonderfully realised and the audience is eased into it brilliantly through John Blackthorne.I do not wish to spoil this show for those who are interested but I'll simply say, this show has everything you could want in a solid miniseries. It's destined to become a classic down the line and I'm sure I'll rewatch it countless times. Just go watch it.",10
"WHY THEY DON'T SPEAK PORTUGUESE??","I'm liking the show so far, interesting story and some well developed characters. But I'm truly, really REALLY MAD that whenever they say they will speak portuguese, they speak english. At first I was very confused, but then I understood they probably made this to be well received by their target audience, ignoring historical accuracy and disrespecting the rest of the world, specially portuguese culture and portuguese speakers. I see this happening often in the industry, such as in Hugo Cabret (english instead of french), and in All The Light We Cannot See (instead for german). Sad and disappointing.",8
"Huge potential that fails in realization","This TV show hit me hard after the pilot episode. Great effects, perfect atmosphere, beautiful scenery, perfect casting on japanese's part - everything was working out. Same with the second episode, and a bit weaker with the third. And that's it. The series should have ended there, or just fricking utilize the potential it had. But it didn't. I felt tricked as the episodes went on, as they are making you to believe some perfect storm is coming to brace yourself for action. But it doesn't!!! And it makes you feel tricked. Instead, you are getting more and more inconclusive dialogue that seems to lead nowhere. And it DOES lead nowhere. Or at least they are saving the efforts for the final episode. I would like my time invested here back, thank you very much!",6
"Poorly done","Well I've never been in the minority this bad in along time.ð But I have to admit this limited series for me was a major disappointment. The acting and set designs were top notch. But the writing, directing and editing were confusing, especially when they would throw in characters out of no where. An example would be how the Englishman, who is shown as an old man in the last show, still unclear of the purpose of that. Also I have to say that the show became rather boring to me. What with numerous tea services, multiple suicides and the enigmatic conversations. Even the love scenes were lame. (Hey cut me a break I'am 70 years old. ð. Pops.",4
"Best series of the year already","Absolutely loved this show. I was kinda skeptical when i started watching it because I didn't know it was based on a popular novel so I had no idea what i got myself into. Turned out to be just what i needed and what I've been looking for. If you're into historical series/films this really is what you should be watching right now. Best on the market right now imo. The characters are very well played. I have seen some of the old Kurosawa movies and have always been intrigued by Japanese culture and this show excelled in showcasing it. The use of poetry is just subliminal. This show got me feeling all types of ways. Gotta admit I even almost shed a tear...",10
"Incredibly real and beautiful","From the set design to the acting, all tied together in beautiful cinematography.The dark crisp picture and angled camera lines make it feel so genuine, so striking fresh and new. Especially as the journey is from the perspective of an outsider. I was fearful of it, bit it might be one of the best things of disneys modern era.That being said, only two episodes so far and I wil revise this upon completion.The main actor is so far, 10/10. Excited to watch the rest, 0 cringe so far, just a great story unfolding.Back to the cinematography, it's the kind of filming that toy could pause at almost any occasion and take a still that would be beautiful, it's reflection of the Japanese pursuit of perfection is done very well. The colour has only been matched in my opinion and from memory by a relatively unknown series called Camelot.I could watch this all day.",10
"Sublime story telling and Excellent engaging plot","Honestly , I was skeptic bout this series considering it's history and might be boring. But the first episode itself is designed in such a way it burns a intense curious desire to know more. The characters and cinematography is really good. I must say I wasn't expecting anything like this but this was exceptional. The character development is at a perfect pace making this series engaging and exciting. The Portuguese and Japan relationship and how a lot of Japan is struggling with power yet wanting to know things bout the world in such a dire situation sparks interest. I'm definitely going to recommend this to anyone as I myself who don't watch history and all , find it really interesting. 10/10 for me considering, series this days are so monotonous and boring.",10
"Not as superb as the book, but pretty good on it's own","I read the book almost 2 decades ago, so I managed to forget most of the details, but I still manage to fetch some when watching the show.Overall, the book was just superb. James Clavell managed to capture the essence of 17th century Japan so well, I could almost feel as though I was John Blackthorne discovering and experiencing Japan for the first time, for all it's beatiful but also horrific sides.The show is very well made and managed to capture most of that essence, but of course on the medium of TV it's really hard to convey all the details of the book.Therefore, If I try to look at it from a blank slate standpoint, the show is almost excellent, but if you liked the show then I can't recommend enough that your read the book, it's just *chef's kiss*.",9
"Looks gorgeous, prepare to read","Cinematography is gorgeous. Costumes are great. Main character is an English pilot of a Dutch Merchant ship, who arrives in Japan in 1600. I really appreciate an American production being set in Japan, having a Japanese cast that acts out their lines in Japanese. As far as representation goes, I think this is the only right choice.However, they decided not to do the same with the other languages. When people are speaking in Portuguese, Spanish and even Dutch, the actors speak English. And as an American production, you do not want to have a series that is ALL subtitles. The series is made by and for an English speaking (and maybe Japanese) audience after all. I see a lot of people being salty about the amount of reading they have to do, or the lack of Portuguese being spoken. In my opinion, making a bilingual English/Japanese show is the best choice, ensuring the least amount of subtitles. They are able to reach a wide audience, ensure quality of performances in these two languages, and be respectful of the country it is set in. Would have been fun if it were a Portuguese production for accuracy, but is not.So, TL;DR. Looks and sounds great! Hope they keep up the quality. If reading buggs you, this show is not for you.",9
"Entertaining","I like it very much, but it is not epic yet for me.I like the acting, most of the characters, the visual effects, the settings, the way the story is told, the difference between a simple person and the higher classes, the struggle of a European in the Japanse culture. I am no expert but I think the clothing, weapons etc. Are looking good.You do not need to think a lot, but they put you on the wrong food on purpose every time. So after a while you know the trick. And it is also easy to figure out why things are happening. But at the other hand it was sometimes confusing for me with all the characters. And I am sorry, but some characters really looked like each other, especially with their helmets on. I saw alost 3 the same people. Luckily they had a different name or no name. I do not like it so much when they use 2 almost identical faces or names.Some characters I did not like completely, like John and the son of Yoshii. I really liked the focus on the faces. I was really trying the figure out what they were thinking. Everybody has a second or third agenda. I aslo liked how the managed the languages.I did not like it so much that there was a lot of Japenese speech in it, but at the other hand I like the voices and the way the talked. So I really needed to pay attention. It did not bother me anymore so much, but when they are swithing suddenly, I sometimes missed some parts. I understand that the Portugese is in English, but why not also just Portugese?I am watching a different series: Warrior. It is about the Chinese in America in the 19th century. Everybody speaks their own language. But when they speak with each other you are fluent English. When they speak with others, you will hear the Chinese. And when they want to speak with the Americans you here them speak less fluent English. That was a nice attention to detail I would have liked here also. It is an Englishman who speaks Portugese but I only hear the English accent?I also like that John is just some entertainment and he is used as a pawn. He adepted but is still not fully accepted.There is much too like and I want more :).",8
"One of the best drama series so far","I wish I could give this fantastic series a 10/10 score rating, but some of the major and minor flaws which I couldn't disregard or overlook forced me not giving it a full score.The first major flaw is the cast of John Blackthorne played by Cosmo Jarvis, who in general, is not a bad actor, but if compared him with the older version of Shogun played by Richard Chamberlain, cast him as Blackthorne is not a good choice. His height is a bit of short that made him obscure among the Japanese actors, even among the female ones, his didn't stand out as a Western white man. During the ancient time, the Japanese people were short in general, if cast an average height white man like Jarvis is an obvious flaw. Furthermore, other than his height is not tall enough, not only he looks too ordinary, but also without strong charisma.The second flaw is Anna Sawai, who plays Toda Mariko. In this series, Mariko can speak Portuguese and English. But her English is too fluent and too American. In that era, only a few Portuguese missionary monks in Japan, the American military ships and merchants were not yet presented, how a woman could speak such fluent and perfect American English without even an error or even a stutter to find an appropriate English word? More ridiculous is she could instantly translate the Japanese into English without any hesitation like those professional translators working in the UN council.What makes this drama series so great, on the other hand, is also the great casting. Hiroyuki Sanada, Tokume Nishioka, Shinnosuke Abe, Tadanobu Asano, Moeka Hoshi, and Takehiro Hira...All of these Japanese actors are so great. Especially Mr. Sanada, who played Yoshii Toranaga. Mr. Sanada is like a rare vintage wine, too good to not mentioning here.The setting, the costumes, the dialogue (except Mariko's fluent English), the soundtrack, the special CGI effect, the directing and editing...All of them are near-perfect.",8
"The return of the samurai","Every time I come across the name of a Japanese movie or series, I unconsciously compare it to Seven Samurai? Is it better than Seven Samurai? Does it depict honor better? Does he have the ability to show love as much as Akira Kirosawa? Is there a hero with little wisdom but with honor? Where is the unity in the story? Does it tell the viewers a new secret about the mysterious and wonderful culture of the samurai? For all these questions, Shogun receives an acceptable answer. The series took me deep into Japan and the enchanting culture of the samurai. When you choose someone who ordered you to commit suicide. Isn't it amazing? How do you adhere to rituals to such an extent and at the same time lie and plot?",9
"Brilliant","Mr. Sanada definitely was born for this role! Outstanding performance, what an actor! I'm a big fan of his talent for long time, and I'm so happy he was able to realize this impressive and magnificent project as an artist and producer.Anna Sawai as Mariko and Shinnosuke Abe as Buntaro also won my heart. <3Big thanks and delight to production designers, costumes designers, decorators for creating an authentic and amazing atmosphere of old Japan. And thanks to the operators for the magnificent picture, it's just a masterpiece!And it was a special pleasure to listen to beautiful Japanese speech!Thank you all from Russia for ""ShÃ´gun"", it was great great pleasure. BRAVO!",7
"So good - but I wanted more.","If you like political dramas, this is the show for you. It is reminiscent of the early seasons of Game of Thrones.The show starts with a British sailor, the first of his kind, washing up on the shores of Japan. He has motive. The Portuguese have reached Japan before the British. A religious conflict exists between the two nations.The entire series almost has a romantic quality about it. Foreign British sailor and his Japanese Christian interpreter... At this point in history, at least in the show, depicts many Christian Japanese converts driven by European missionaries. Catholics versus Protestants. But at its core, this show is about Japan.I hope that the show was true to Japanese culture, because I feel that I know much more about it now. From paper houses to samurai, this show captures an ancient culture well.A good watch for fantasy and history buffs.",3
"Incoherent freak show","Incoherent wet dreams by six different directors, this production is riddled with persistent illogical behaviors that are hastily covered up by poorly staged philosophical lectures. There's a pitiful attempt to romanticize the twisted values of death, showcased through concentrated scenes of seppukus and beheadings. These moments are mingled with loud symbolizations of cultural and religious shocks, ultimately crafting nothing but a hollow freak show of shogunate Japan. The disjointed narrative fails to cohesively bind the directors' visions, resulting in a fragmented portrayal that lacks depth and genuine insight into the historical period it aims to represent.",10
"Not Marvel Enough","I saw this show on Disney and thought it would be something really worth watching like the Mulan remake or Shang Chi, but it was much different. So i'll tell you how it could have been improved.1. main actor should have been Chris Pratt
2. Simu liu should be the lord guy
3. Should be set in Avengers universe instead of Sengoku Japan. Sengoku japan period is just too complex.4. more comedy, less baby killing
5. Ship should have been a space ship
6. Baby yoda cameo
7. Blackthorne should have spider-man like abilities
8. Samurai should have the Force
9. Somone should read the sub titles
10. They need a big dumb guy like in guardiansfixed it.",8
"Certainly not for everyone","This show is certainly not for everyone, and I have a feeling if you aren't familiar with either the books or the 1980s mini-series, you will be profoundly bored out of your mind. I made it through about 40 minutes of the first episode until I was asleep. I guess I get the great reviews in that the show LOOKS good, but as an American, and I assume this was made for American audiences, I found I have almost no interest in feudal Japan, or what went on there. I have subtitles running on all of the movies I watch, so reading them was not a problem. The problem was that the story is completely unrelatable to me, and no, I don't watch ""superhero"" movies either, for those of you who just suggested I go do that. I just simply didn't care about this at all. The glut of award nominations made me finally tune in, and I tuned out just as fast. Again, I'll say, not for everyone. Make sure you know what you're getting into if you decide to watch.",10
"East Meets West","FX's adaptation of ""Shogun"" navigates the complex waters of cultural and narrative adaptation with a visually stunning and thought-provoking series that delves into a fascinating slice of Japanese culture through a Western lens. As someone who had not engaged with the novel or the 1980s series before watching the new adaptation, I found the experience enriched and clarified after reading the source material.The show's conclusion, which has been met with mixed reactions, becomes more coherent after understanding the deeper transformation and conflicts the protagonist undergoes in the novel-a nuance that the series only touches on. The show portrays a less intense version of the protagonist's personal journey and the crucial conflicts, particularly one that culminates in a character's death, which seems underdeveloped and thus may leave some viewers puzzled.Criticism regarding language use in the show, particularly the absence of Portuguese in favor of English, while authentic Japanese is maintained, is an interesting point of contention. However, this choice seems to align with the author's intent in the novel-to highlight the protagonist's foreignness in Japan, rather than to provide a linguistically accurate depiction. The use of Japanese and subtitles effectively reminds the audience that they are peering into a world vastly different from their own, fulfilling the show's goal to immerse rather than simply entertain.""Shogun"" does not aim to be a grand epic of war but rather a compelling exploration of character and culture. The landscapes are breathtaking, the characters are intricately drawn, and the plot offers a richness that lingers long after the screen goes dark. It's a series that demands attentive viewing, rewarding its audience with a deeper appreciation of its narrative and thematic complexities.",10
"Best TV in years","With the advent of the various streaming services, the money going into tv production has increased dramatically and this has produced a lot of excellent content, but also a lot of dross.This production of Shogun is simply the best piece of tv in the last few years.The sets, costumes and everything about the look and feel of the drama were faultless.The dramatic elements, fight scenes etc, were all sufficiently realistic, showing fair bits of blood and gore to be sufficiently explicit and sobering without being gratuitous.The truly outstanding achievement was the way it managed to convey the mentality of the Samurai mindset, much of which of course had to be unspoken. This is done with some quite intense scenes with incredible use of language and pacing, which enabled the actors to convey the emotion and sentiment with great subtlety and requiring the viewer to engage on an intellectual level and truly feel the emotions and motivations depicted by the characters. The apparent suppression of emotion within social interactions, including the brutality of the requirement to commit seppuku, or the 'matter of fact' acceptance of death as an act of service within the Samurai code of honour, which is somewhat at odds with reverence for life as a philosophical axiom of western thought, was transformed for me into comprehension of 'simplicity' as a defining thread within Japanese culture and philosophy. And while this probably reflects the quality of Clavell's original writing, this was certainly a brilliant dramatic achievement by all who contributed to this production. It certainly mocks those who complain in these ratings that this 'isn't the book'. These people have totally missed the point. As a piece of televisual tapestry that weaves historical fact with human drama and ultimately, human morality, this is as good as it gets. Congratulations to all involved.",10
"As Close To Perfect As A Show Can Get","I could go into detail about how great this show is, but it would not do justice to it. This show is an experience. The performances are uniformly stellar. Anna Sawai, Cosmo Jarvis, and Hiroyuki Sanada deserve all the praise they have received. Tadanobu Asano is phenomenal as Kashigi Yabushige. One of my all-time favorite television characters and performances. Also, Yuka Kouri as Kiku stole every scene she was in. I wish I could name all the actors and speak of their brilliance. The entire cast deserves Emmy awards. Hats off to Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks for bringing this story to life in the way that they did. Everyone who worked on this show created their own masterpiece within a masterpiece. Having not read the book, nothing went where I expected it to. By the end of the series, I felt changed as a person. I felt grateful to be alive in this time--when this show premiered. Give this show a watch. Great art makes you feel like you are part of something great, which this show certainly did for me.",10
"A Masterclass in Storytelling","It seems that this project took a lot of sacrifices to meet it's goal, I don't wanna spoil it but this is my experience:Plot: Engaging, unpredictable, well-developed.Characters: Well-rounded, complex, relatable, dynamic.Writing: Sharp, eloquent, captivating, intelligent, thought-provoking, witty, seamless, evocative, poetic.Visuals (for TV series): Stunning, breathtaking, visually striking, cinematic, atmospheric, immersive.Direction: Skillful, masterful, innovative, visionary, bold, imaginative, inspired.Emotional Impact: Heartfelt, poignant, moving, powerful, resonant, touching, evocative.Acting: Stellar, convincing, authentic, powerful, nuanced, mesmerizing, award-worthy.",9
"Great","I do not really have that much words about this: it's just a good show.I have not read original book(s) and I saw some glimpses of the original show when I was like 5 or something, so only thing I really remember about it is ""it was bright and colorful"". Definitely not like this modern adaptation, which is dark both in terms of narrative, images and lighting. That ""darkness"" made the show feel ""real"".I am not talking about the show (and books) being based on real life events, though. I am talking about the overall feel of the events and emotions portrayed by the characters and some sense... I do not know, fatalism? I wonder if this is just part of Japanese culture, though, since they do have a somewhat special view on death (and life). Mariko's character in last 2 episodes kind of cemented this feeling, and then a single phrase from Toronaga in the last episode made it monumental for me.So I do recommend trying this show. It also has good soundtrack, and it is one of the few modern shows that embraces ""dirty frame"". I think my 2 main complains are that Blackthorne learnt Japanese a bit too quickly, or at least is shown understanding it way too often, and that there were places where people were supposed to be speaking Spanish (if I understood correctly), but English was spoken.",10
"You know what.... THIS IS AMAZING!!!","Usually, I don't bother writing reviews, but Shogun really made me want to say something. After just two episodes, I'm hooked. The whole vibe of the show is something else-it's got that epic feel you get from shows like ""Game of Thrones,"" but with its own unique twist.What really got me was how they've set everything up. The story's got layers, you know? And the characters aren't just cardboard cutouts; they've got depth, motivations, and their own share of problems. It's like you can feel the tension and stakes just getting higher with every scene.Honestly, I wasn't expecting to get this into it, but here I am, waiting for the next episode. If it keeps up like this, I reckon it could fill that ""Game of Thrones"" shaped hole a lot of us have been missing.",8
"Well written and acted but..",".. if like me you were expecting Samurai battle sequences you will be sorely disappointed. Although the show is well written and there is great depth to the main cast of characters, alongside the politics of the show that involves a lot of twists and turns in its scheming - even with the poster for the show featuring a samurai army charging into battle there is zero amount of battle scenes.Even when it does come down to Shogun's fight scenes it seems the director is a little inexperienced with filming combat, as a lot of it seems very clunky and it's a little hard to follow what's happening at times. A shame as I feel like they could have done a lot more with showing how samurai fought and trained especially with the conflict between the samurai clans, even just to add a bit more depth to their culture compared to shows like Game of Thrones otherwise the series would have been a 9/10 for me.Definitely worth a watch though if you are a fan of this genre.",6
"Watchable but ultimately disappointing.","Having read the book and seen the original series I was interested to see a newly updated Shogun series. The ratings were high and it was being compared to Game of Thrones so I became excited. However my hopes were dashed pretty early as soon as Blackthorne appeared and opened his mouth. Some problems were:
-Setting. The series is filmed in Vancouver and doesn't look like Japan (I live here). Other parts use too much CG. And it's way too dark and misty. Again, this should be Japan, not Canada.-Plot. The series was compared to GoT but all the good things from GoT are missing. Very little action, suspense and nudity. A plot that doesn't keep the viewers interested and deviates from the book. It was actually pretty boring with little payoff in the end.-Acting. Wow, Blackthorne. Who is this whining guy who can't speak properly? Definitely not the captain and important figure in the book. He ruined most scenes when he opened his mouth.Also some of the acting by the young Japanese men was terrible (unfortunately how they're taught to act over here). They were a big distraction.It wasn't all bad as some actors such as Sanada put in a good shift and showed their class. It was also interesting seeing it from the point of view of the Japanese and some of the set designs and costumes were very nice.It is watchable and maybe good for something different but in the end it was ultimately a let down and just spent too much time on things that ultimately made the pacing too slow and uninteresting.",1
"Nah","Absolutely overrated! The perspective is entirely from a Western, white American viewpoint, attempting to repaint history and manipulate the narrative. Not worth watching!3 episodes in...Only Okay for me. Going to wait for all episodes so I can binge it with a free trial. Never will read the book since this was create with fantasy self insert fanfic mindset. Only saw some of the 1980 scenes. Production is the best aspects of that remake. As someone that research and study Japanese history in my spare time. That fill and respark my interest and knowledge of the late Sengoku period/Warring states period. The show could be a jumping off points for non academic populace who want to do their own research about that conflict, people and time. But I doubt...",10
"NIoh Fans Must Watch","Fans of the video game Nioh will know that this story is based on the life of William Adams; the white man given the honorary title of samurai in the 1600s. Also fans of the original show Shogun will recognize the same story.This is a must watch for fans of the game, although the main character has his name changed to Blackthorne. The rest of the story does divert in various places and is fictionalized for dramatic effects, but the main story is there to enjoy.Overall, this is a great period piece that revolves around the evolution of weapons, black powder, and rivalries between Catholics, Protestants, and the very heart of Japan.",9
"Superb","As a longtime fan of James Clavell's epic novel Shogun, I had high expectations for this adaptation, and I'm pleased to say it exceeded them. From the opening scenes, I was utterly transported to 17th century feudal Japan. The series does an exceptional job recreating the era's intense political maneuverings and cultural clashes between the powerful Toranaga clan and the stranded English pilot John Blackthorne.Cosmo Jarvis' nuanced portrayal of Blackthorne was a standout, deftly capturing his inner conflict as he's torn between two worlds. The entire cast delivered compelling performances. However, it was the show's remarkable production values that truly immersed me. The sweeping cinematography gloriously showcased Japan's natural splendor, while the intricately designed sets paid meticulous attention to historical accuracy.Most impressively, the writers managed to streamline Shogun's complex narrative without compromising its integrity. The pacing remained taught, the high-stakes drama engrossing throughout. Whether you're discovering this story for the first time or revisiting it, this adaptation is a masterful rendition that does justice to the iconic novel.",10
"I missed this level of weekly Tv show","I was just saying the other day, I haven't been so invested in a Tv show (even though I know the outcome) since GoT and HoD or tWD (with Rick), and I have loved it.I know there are slower parts for the audience used to fast Netflix flicks, but it actually makes sense and fits the culture presented. You can't get into that culture mood if you speed through it.Even with small changes compared to the source material (and keep in mind it's called an adaptation), it is an amazing experience and I am grateful they did it. It is that something different very highly needed.Please don't ruin it with another season, there is no need for it!!! Find another book and make another wonderful limited series ;)",10
"The finale was a letdown","The series was one of the best. I really enjoyed the attention to details, the action sequences, acting was on point, plus there were so many satisfying scenes - Fuji pointing Blackthrone's gun at Omi, Kiku/Mariko/Blackthrone scene that night at the tea house, the look on Father Alvito's face when he realizes his church is gonna be beside the teahouse, the entire episode 9 etc.That said, as with most mini-series, the finale is often use to neatly tie up all the loose ends so I knew going in it's not gonna be the most exciting, but this was still a letdown. The opening ""dream"" sequence should be made clear it was a hallucination but it was presented like a flash forward. Because this was not clear it took away the tension later in the episode when Blackthrone threatens to sepukku himself.Yabushige was done dirty. His character started out as somewhat akin to Littlefinger in GoT but he is much more nuanced. We learned he is just looking out for himself, trying to survive and maybe grab some lands along the way, he wasn't power hungry like Toranaga. He was also a lot more human, but not the brightest so he got played. I don't think his end was justified. It is not unusual to switch allegiance this time in Japanese history. Ieyasu (actual person Toranaga is based on) did that himself once he realize his lord was losing, Ochiba in the show switch too in the finale so Yubashige ""betrayal"" is made out to be a bigger deal then it needs to be.One of Mariko's ladies wrote to Omi to report his uncle's treachery, why to Omi? He has been on his uncle's side the entire him, it seems odd to snitch on someone to the person that was seemingly on his side. Unless she is Toranaga spy and did this intentionally to test Omi's loyalty, but that wasn't made clear in the show it's just my speculation.There is no way anyone will trust Toranaga by the time the finale rolls around. The show was presented partly from Toranaga perspective, but imagine this, if it was presented from Ishido's perspective Toranaga would not be looked on so favorably, he has shown everyone is expandable to reach his goals. So there's absolutely no way Ochiba would choose to align with Toranaga, her son is directly threatening his plan on being the absolute ruler. This is the biggest misstep in the series.Toranaga entire plan was for Ochiba to switch sides? It doesn't seem he needs to go as far as he did to feign defeat then. Crimson sky is needed, Mariko did needed to die but Hiromatsu sacrifice seems unnecessary. Also he told his plan to Mariko, his wives knew he's up to something but Hiromatsu his most trusted person was completely cut out from his plan? That's just silly. I also don't like how the series makes Toranaga seem to have some superhuman level intelligence, he wasn't playing chess, the writers him a super human and that takes away from the character making him unrealistic.",10
"One of the best period dramas of the last two decades","After The Crown I can't think of a better period drama than Shogun that has come out in the last 20 years. Chernobyl, Downton Abbey, and Mad Men are up there.But first an apology to Anna Sawai who I blasted as a terrible actress after watching Monarch. I am eating crow and Anna was stellar as Mariko in Shogun and I won't be surprised if she garners a well-deserved Emmy nomination. I am excited to see her career unfold.The Japanese casting is spot-on, Hiroyuki Sonada was flawless. Costumes are amazing and I think the cinematography in low-light shooting was beautiful. The storyline is engaging and the chess moves between Toranaga and the Regents are exciting. I read many reviews saying the pacing is too slow/boring but I never felt like that, if anything it could have gone slower.I was never entirely bought into John Blackthorn's character but Cosmo Jarvis was consistent in the acting, it may just not be my style/preference. I also wish the show dug more into the flashback scenes, they didn't connect well enough to the modern storyline.Overall though it is amazing. I'd probably give it a 9/10 but since there's such a dearth of period dramas (likely because of high production costs) this handicaps to a 10/10.",8
"Awesome example of feudal Japan.","I wasn't aware that this show was going to be aired on FX. I watched the 80's mini series of Shogun and I remembered being taken aback as a early teenager. I was always a fan of documentary type movies or mini series shows, but Japan always remained a mystery to me. My father who had visited Japan while he was in the military was also fascinated by the Japanese actors in Shogun. He said that they portrayed their customs just as he experienced it.The main Japanese actor, Mr Sanada has been a favorite international actor to me. He brings his best to this 2024 mini series. My only issue with it being a mini series is the commercials. They are about 4 to 5 minutes long and the story seems shorter and makes it difficult at times to keep up. It would have been much better if it was made into a 3 or 4 hour movie. I haven't read the book, but it will be the next book in my list.In writing my thoughts on the two episodes, I decided to just say what I felt as so many have expressed my exact thoughts. I can't wait for the 3rd episode as I am hooked!!",9
"Really good, but....","Visually brilliant. Excellent acting. And of course, James Clavell's fabulous story as a basis. The acting is top notch across the board, but particular praise needs to be given to Hiroyuki Sanada.BUT....As an old man born in the Far East, of course I've read most of James Clavell's books. I also watched the 1980 version with Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune. And whilst as a spectacle this version is better (21st century production standards and technology, of course), at the point of writing (episode 3) this production falls short of true greatness. Why? Simply because they have rushed the story. The promotion of Blackthorn to Hatamoto, for example, appears out of nowhere. Blackthorn's respect for Toranaga seems to appear out of nowhere.",9
"A Stranger in a Strange World","The cinematography is top notch. The beautiful Japanese waters and landscapes make for an awe inspiring yet intimidating landscape. Being a stranger in a strange land is an impossible feeling to escape for the main character and you as the viewer. Shogun is also extremely historically accurate which is so refreshing. The world in the 17th century was becoming a smaller place with the English, Spanish, and Portuguese building massive fleets and sailing to every corner they can to spread their empires and of course Christianity. But of course which is the best sect of Christianity? Catholicism, Protestant? The Japanese lords will be thrown into these empires quarrels and every one will try to gain power for themselves.",7
"beyond expectation","I thought I was facing the first two boring episodes!After finishing two episodes, I realized that I was nailed to the ground, and after a long time, I am going to watch an attractive and shocking series. The story of the series continued beautifully and the characters were in their right place. The only point I had until this moment was why there was no more news about the crew of the ship and what fate has been decided for them until this moment?Using the Japanese language and showing the Japanese people with their own language and culture was another positive point that I was interested in.I hope that we will witness an attractive and stunning ending.",5
"Only good in episodes 1 and 2","Initially I was very interested in this series after starting to watch the first and second episodes, then after entering the third episode and so on until the end of this series the plot was too slow. I tried to watch until the end episode after episode but I couldn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the first and second episodes, For those who don't like watching shows with unclear endings, it's better if you don't watch this series at all because it is certain that there will be no continuity. I'm surprised why this series can get such a high rating, I personally think it deserves a 6 out of 10.",10
"Only first three","I've watched it from the first to the 7th episode, and its quality downgrades on every new episode. Not gonna lie the first three episodes were very promising, the characters were very talented and well suited for their roles. But subsequent to these first three eps, the series started to become kinda ""Mexican drama series"", no story development, characters were just a vessel to reach the estimated screenplay timeout and repetitive ideas like ""Blackthorn kept asking for his ship back like kid"". Not only this but also you don't have emotions to the characters like getting sad or at least feeling something, because all they were doing is having sex and living their daily lives.What a wasted potentials!",10
"Just Epic","Epic is the Best Word to describe this series. Sanada-Samas Best Role ever! This series is rich and deep on culture. It plays wonderful wirh two clashibg culturrs, where the main Actors learn from each other. The situations and mimic of Sanada-Sama is from my point of view brilliant! Also to menton, that in the making of, he truly stated the meaning of the series as Actor and his first Producer Role at the same time. You can hobor work and dedication with watching this series. You won't be dissapointed. I would like to state, that this series is on a level with Game of Thrones in terms of quality! (if you want to conpare motion picture quality, not content).",10
"A series that no one asked for but everyone needs to see.","I was simply not expecting this piece of art, an amazing TV show in the 17th century with a Japan little discovered by the world, it leads us to excellent performances with very well-made costumes.The dialogues are great, you really feel immersed in the TV show from chapter one, normally I wouldn't give a 10 but really from the first chapter you are absorbed by the story and how the main character will develop.I can not recommend Shoung enough, is the best show I have seen in a while, it has everything but what I loved the most was the development of the characters is just amazingA series that no one asked for but everyone needs to see.",9
"Stunning","Absolutely breathtaking. The cinematography is purposeful as well as beautiful; nothing is superfluous. The performers are, without exception, masters of their craft. No one flounders. They delivery monologues with a look. Every.single.one of them soars. I havent read the book or seen the 1980s film so I came into this blind and was swept away.Perhaps the most surprising thing about such a sweeping epic is that it DOESNT feel grand. It's rich and detailed but nothing feels overwrought or dramatic in an unnecessary way. Everything feels graceful.I'll toss out there that the treatment of women in this series is also incredible; nuanced, strong, and unapologetic.Yes you're going to need to read subtitles, but if that's not normally your thing, it's absolutely worth it.",10
"A Historically Captivating Masterpiece","I am very skeptical about eastern films but this principle is soon to be altered after seeing Shogun. I believe this latest historically inspired genre brings more elating and electrifying feelings behind the screens. It starts by enjoying the captivating sound mix and background score which together ripples the film's frequency to scintilate a purposeful masterpiece. The historical essence portrayed perfectly by precise costumes and well prepared landscapes drive the desire to travel back in time. Perphaps it is the motionary Osaka that wakes the joy of wanting to belong in the past. I see this film to be well written, acted and produced to meet the needs of historical drama lovers just like myself, and I can boldly put on record here that this is the best Japanese themed movie ever made on screen. There is no hiding the fact that Shogun is a must watch piece if you call yourself a movie lover!",10
"Great show! Very Truncated.","TLDR: The show is awesome. The music, costuming, and sets are all top notch. The cinematography is breathtaking, the acting: stupendous. The writers have done VERY well with what they were clearly told to do: squeeze a 428,000 word epic into six, one-hour long TV episodes. They did very well and delivered a fantastic Cliffs Notes version of the novel. If the showrunner(s) had allowed them to tell the entire story, I would have given this a 10 instead of an 8.I read Shogun, by James Clavell, because it came highly recommended and because I considered it a challenge: I am not used to reading books that are quite that long. I fell in love with it. It is such a beautiful love letter from a Westerner to Japan. I just wish the show had taken on the monumental task of telling the entire story. One of the reasons the book is so long is that it takes quite a long time for a Westerner to learn the ins and outs of a culture as complicated and nuanced as feudal Japan. It would have been so wonderful to see the entire novel in its rich fullness played out with the level of excellence achieved in this show.",8
"The captive has a voice","I enjoyed watching this show episode by episode and I knew it needs a season two more than any other show I have watched. I do fear that the story could burn itself out and leave a lame stale taste in the audience if the writers try to extend the series for too long. But, in terms of screening, the show is intense with Japanese war lore decorating the grips fantastic. The communication between the foreign and the Japanese is well given making the story more full of flavor with a entertaining edge rather than a busted language barrier. The tension between the characters is surreal which gives the audience a sense that the story is actually happening rather than a scripted play. If your into the culture of the samurai or Japanese war cultural history, this is a must watch. I hope season two is just as gripping.",9
"In a league of its own","I am currently reading Japanese book Musashi by Eijo Yoshikawa. It is about the life and philosophy of 17th century Samurai named Miyamoto Musashi. The portrayal of Japan from that era and its rich, detailed culture are certainly noteworthy. Musashi and Shogun are 2 most famous tomes describing Japan from that era. Hence I was very curious to see the TV adaptation.The show deserves all the praise it is getting. The cinematography, acting, writing, soundtrack and pacing of story are all impeccable. The character of Mariko-sama is perhaps the best development of a female protagonist I have seen in a long time. Anna deserves all the awards that she is bound to get for this role.The translation of dialogues is also an integral part of the story. We get to see both Japanese dialogues and then see how it is being translated in English by the concerned character. How an interpreter can try to bridge the gap between 2 distant cultures is fascinating to watch.Last but not the least, the poetry in the show is very thoughtful. I mention my most favourite dialogue here,
""Accepting death isn't surrender. Flowers are only flowers because they fall.""",10
"Absolutely brilliant","I finished the new Shogun tonight and I got to say..It's magnificent.When I was a kid, the original Shogun adaptation was my first introduction to Japan and since then I really fell in love with that culture.I went in very reluctantly into watching the new one, but now that I'm done, I think that it might even be better, or at least even.There is spiritual depth in Shogun 2024, and also great depth of characters. There is hidden meaning to all of the action.The depictions of Mariko and Yabushige are especially great. Not to mention, the cast is made up out of some of the greatest Japanese actors to ever perform.I very highly recommend it.",10
"Disappointed.","We watched Shogun and were really excited about it. Especially after all these good recommendations and after it was compared to game of thrones (we are really big fans of GoT).But to be honest we can't understand the comparison to Game of Thrones or the hype about shogun.The first episode was good and promising, but the series simply lost more and more per episode. It was very long and unfortunately nothing really happened. In episode 8, a beautiful arc of tension was built up again that made us confident for the finale. However, the last episode was a pure failure. In the end, we were really disappointed with the series because we simply hoped for more. And it is definitely not comparable with Game of Thrones.",6
"Last episode felt like an anti-climax","Was decent until the last episode.I understand that it is based on the book and that even showing the battle wasn't the end of the world although it could have been a spectacular reconstruction of a battle that has rarely been depicted in film or media.The disappointing thing was not knowing what happens to the main protagonist Blackthorne. If you want to know what happens to the Japanese characters then that isn't too hard as it follows the historical timeline somewhat. However Blackthorne is fictional and it feels like the whole series is built to bring you close to the character before dumping it right at the end with no end outcome for him other than pulling a boat out of the water that may or may not be repeatedly sunk by his overlord.Unless there is a second series that could show the battle but more importantly provide closure for Blackthorne as a character I feel that the series is left undersold by a weak last episode.",4
"Shogun could be the series of 2024","I have watched the original series many times, as own on DVD, 2 episodes in and it is a very good show, so far that don't seem to have simplified the story, I also love that they have correct languages and added subtitles so you can hear the wonderful sounding Japanese where appropriate.I am looking forward to the rest of the series as the start of the show has real promise and the cast fit the show well, there are also the right level of background cast to mak it feel like a living place.My only gripe so far is the clothes and scenery look excellent but there is a blur or out of focus at the edges quite often.",10
"Captivating","I had no interest in watching this series and initially didn't watch. One night I was surfing and came across the first two episodes being aired and although I didn't plan on watching I found myself completely drawn into the story. I remember watching the 1980 version with Richard Chamberlain which was good but this one is superior so far. I adore Hiroyuki Sanada and I think it's his presence and acting skill that gives this version a different, more authentic feel. After watching the two episodes I found another film with Sanada, The Last Samurai, and was completely absorbed. He's a very under-rated actor. I hope this new series gives him the exposure and recognition he deserves.",9
"Might be the best show of the year","I know it's far too early to say this, but based off the first two episodes alone this seems like an absolute hit.The dialogue is captivating, the acting phenomenal so far (Hiroyuki Sanada is an instant crowd fave), and the characters are quite interesting. I appreciate that the characters have been presented as morally gray, and that they don't insult the viewers intelligence by spelling out obvious character details like Blackthornes need to adapt to this new culture to survive in this world, or the many intricate political plots driving the show forward. Any point of confusion is cleared out tastefully within the dialogue and it's easy to follow.I have not yet read the book, nor am I an expert on this period of Japanese history, but from what I do know, it seems fairly historically accurate in its portrayal of costumes, Japanese philosophy, and the intricacies in political rivalries. In the case that you are not aware of the historical context, the show even released a mini documentary episode a week prior to the first episodes which contained all the relevant background you might need to understand the show. This is something I very much appreciate because I like to dig deeper into the history or lore of every show or movie that I like, it makes the entire experience much more immersive.I don't understand the criticism it's been getting on the basis of being mostly in Japanese... considering it is set in Japan pre globalization I thought that would be a given. It would actually be unrealistic for characters to BE speaking in english, but I digress. I get that reading subtitles is not everyone's cup of tea but i'd much rather do that than have badly dubbed or unrealistic dialogue which would break the immersion for me.I'm a little apprehensive about the pacing for the rest of the show, although it was perfectly fine for the first two episodes. This is simply because i'm not entirely sure how they'll manage to fit all the details in just another 8 episodes. I really hope they finish on a satisfying note, or with enough of an open ending to actually justify a second season.This definitely wasn't on my radar for the year, I hadn't even heard of the show until it dropped yesterday but since then i've already purchased the book so i can read it when i'm done watching this. It really is just that incredible.If you're a fan of historical drama, or liked shows such as Black Sails and Blue eyed Samurai, this is for you. I highly recommend this show, and i'll be seated for the rest of it to see how it plays out. If the quality remains consistent to the first two episodes, it has the potential to be the best show of the year.",9
"Been waiting.............","I have been waiting for this since i watched the trailer.I am old enough to remember the original series with Richard Chamberlain in the 80's.Never read the book so cannot say if this version or the 80's one is true to it but from the first episode i am sucked in.The scenery/cgi and period costumes are great and i like that the Japanese are speaking Japanese with subtitles as i enjoy things in their original languages. Shame the Portugese speak English but its a minor thing.The lead actors are great(I especially enjoy Hiroyuki Sanada's work)and the English cursing always amuses my childish self.Anyway i am looking forwrd to the rest of the episodes.",9
"Accurate when speaking Japanese, but, where's the Portuguese?","The show is amazing. Beautiful, but, is so disappointing see the characters speaking in Japanese asking for Portuguese interpreters and what you hear is English. So, if you want to be accurate, putting Japanese characters speaking Japanese, why not do the same with Portuguese characters? Since the show targets to be so well portrayed in the particular period, the lack of Portuguese language is disrespectful. Or, should everyone speaks English and simplified the plot related to language barriers. Unfortunately, as a Portuguese speaker, is very strange hearing ""Portuguese"" in English... And I'll not mention the Spanish speaking ""Spanish""... So, it hit the post of great, but still worth to watch it ( and it's way easier if you don't speak Portuguese at all).",10
"A Masterpiece of Authenticity and Emotion","FX's Shogun is an absolute triumph, delivering a richly detailed and emotionally resonant adaptation of James Clavell's epic novel. From the first episode, I was completely immersed in the world of feudal Japan, thanks to the show's dedication to authenticity and high-quality production values.The characters are exceptionally well-developed, and I found myself deeply caring about their journeys. John Blackthorne, portrayed by Cosmo Jarvis, is a standout with his compelling transformation from a shipwrecked sailor to a respected samurai. His interactions with Mariko (Anna Sawai) and Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada) are particularly noteworthy, bringing depth and nuance to the narrative. Mariko, especially, is the heart of the series, her grace and strength making her a beacon of light throughout the story. The supporting characters, such as Yabushige (Tadanobu Asano) and Fuji (Moeka Hoshi), also add rich layers to the storyline, ensuring every scene is engaging and meaningful.One of my favorite scenes is when Blackthorne is first dressed in a kimono. This moment is both humorous and endearing, highlighting his initial naivety and the cultural gap he must bridge. His awkwardness and the reactions of those around him, especially when he gets a playful slap for trying to adjust the kimono, add a charming human touch to the grand narrative.The scene where Blackthorne first meets Mariko and Toranaga in episode 2 is another standout moment. The tension is palpable as Blackthorne, unfamiliar with the local customs and power dynamics, navigates this crucial encounter. The chemistry between the characters is immediate, laying the groundwork for the intricate relationships that develop throughout the series.A particularly fascinating scene is when Toranaga asks Blackthorne to explain the world map. This moment perfectly encapsulates the cultural exchange and mutual curiosity that underpin much of the series. Blackthorne's explanation of the map, and Toranaga's keen interest, highlight the strategic and intellectual dimensions of their alliance.The series excels not just in its character interactions but also in its visual storytelling. The cinematography is breathtaking, with sweeping landscapes and meticulous attention to historical detail. The production design, costumes, and score all contribute to a vivid and immersive viewing experience. The dialogue, rich with context and subtext, makes every conversation as captivating as the action scenes, if not more so.Shogun handles complex themes such as cultural clash, honor, and survival with sophistication. It avoids the pitfalls of orientalism by giving equal weight to Japanese perspectives, making the story feel balanced and respectful. The political machinations and personal struggles are depicted with a maturity and depth that elevate the series beyond mere spectacle.In conclusion, Shogun is an extraordinary series that brings Clavell's vision to life with authenticity and emotional power. The characters, the setting, and the story all come together to create a truly unforgettable viewing experience. This show is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates high-quality historical dramas.",9
"The New GOT? We'll see","First of all I would like to mention that I was skeptical when I first started watching this show simply because Hiroyuki Sanada has been casted as the japanese dude in any and all hollywood movies and shows. Is it really that difficult to find japanese talent? But after watching the first episode I was baffled by the quality of production of this show. Everything from Acting to set to costumes, everything was top notch and I was immersed in feudal japan. This show kind of reminded me of Shogun World from HBO TV series Westworld also featuring Hiroyuki Sanada as Main Japanese Guy, although he was a samurai in that one i believe.",10
"Great show. More please","Just finished the last episode of Shogun - what a joy.The whole thing I found to be superb. The casting, production and overall feel of the show was excellent
I was taken back to feudal Japan and ancient customs.The only regret is that I've heard there won't be more.Hopefully they'll film the next book in the series Tai-Pan. I realise the setting and cast would be different but think the novels would be do well as further adaptations.I think it's probably my favourite show of the year and easy to see where the moneys be spent. The acting was great and Cosmo Jarvis could double as Richard Burtons voice any day.Don't miss it.",8
"season 1 without war","I think Japanese culture is always interesting and attractive. Thanks to the shogun, we had the opportunity to get to know their culture closely. The clothes in the series were so classy. I admired the clothes of the nobles. Their battle armor was legendary. Osaka city and the castle was fine too.I liked the tea house scene and gift to Blacthorne scene. I was confused as to who the gift was.We watched to many seppuku scenes , executions , a little sword fight in Osaka but I was expecting a battle in season finale. Instead, we learned the plans of Toranaga, who has been planning all season.I'm excitedly waiting for the 2nd season and The great battle of 5 armies.",6
"Not the masterpiece that I was promised...","This show has good points. The photography is correct, the music too, the historical respect probably too, with attention to the detail of this civilization and this very particular era. But I still find the series quite disappointing.If i really want to be honest, Shogun is a bit...boring. Far from me the idea that a series must have a lot of action to endorphin the hollows of the mind, but here I still expected much better, Shogun is a bit of an empty shell, a lot of filler and length painful.When we land in the middle of a story of an internal conflict that threatens the whole of Japan, with the 2 most powerful clans in the country, overtones of war and repeated battles throughout, we expect that it ends up breaking, Seeing the art of samurai war.But actually no. Rather, we see a series of political maneuvers, cunning or not, mixed with the very atypical reaction that the protagonists of the series have, and their overinflated honor, just like the proportions that it takes and which can seem a bit ridiculous, seen from our perspective.I found the acting quite decent, but I have a little trouble with English, I don't know if he's supposed to play this idiotic, crude and quite apathetic character, but if that's the case he plays well, because he is difficult to like.Some are comparing Shogun to Game of thrones... Lett me be clear, it's not.",5
"Cosmo Jarvis can't act","Started interesting, with beautiful visuals all the way to the end.All the cast did a great job, great performances.Except for the lead, Cosmo Jarvis. Which is a shame.He has mainly one facial expression, just staring, or shouting sometimes.Like when Mariko was fighting the guards, and he was watching from above, with elbows resting on the wall, clasped hands. What the hell was that?Everybody else around was very tense, but he was looking down like her life was not in danger.The series got more and more boring, partly because of the back and forth translations, having to listen to everything twice.The ending was underwhelming.",10
"Awful show","I reserved my judgment during the first 2-3 episodes because I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt after seeing the various trailers and articles. Dropped it half-way through episode 4 when I started questioning why I was watching this meandering fanfic.The political/religious angle is very poorly fleshed out and overly simplistic. The writing and acting is at times unbelievably cringe.There are a few good performances but they are not enough to salvage the show.Does the show look good? Yeah but that's every other show in 2024.Is the show hollow and devoid of depth? Yeah just like every other show in 2024.",9
"Enjoyed this so much I watched it twice","I enjoyed this mesmerizing and exquisite production, with its amazing cast and meticulous attention to detail, so much that one week after I finished watching it I watched it all over again.My rewatch was partly motivated by the fact that it is hard to take in all the names, characters, and intrigues the first time around, so to allay some of my residual confusion I rewatched each episode, especially the first, very carefully. But my rewatch was also motivated by the sheer enjoyment I had of the richness of the content.Then after my second viewing of the series, I watched the final 17 minutes of the series for a third time, to savor the wonderfully poignant and incisive summing-up and closure those last 17 minutes provide.Lastly, I'd like to say a few words about my favorite main actors in the series. Of course, the stand-outs are Hiroyuki Sanada as the masterful and intriguing Lord Toranaga, and Anna Sawai as the exquisite female lead Mariko -- both have rightfully been nominated for Best Actor/Actress Emmy awards. Particularly on my second viewing, I was also extremely impressed with Tadanobu Asano as Kashigi Yabushige -- his frequent grunts and groans and tic-like movements are wonderfully apt and his performance is perfect. Lastly, a shout-out to star Cosmo Jarvis as John Blackthorne -- too often unnecessarily and unwisely compared to Richard Chamberlain -- I found Jarvis quite appealing and quite relatable, and his wonderful voice, accent, and inflection remind me 100% of Richard Burton. Well cast.In sum, I urge everyone to check out this miniseries. The 10 episodes cover the entire novel and end where the novel ends. If you don't have a subscription to Hulu or Disney+, then take out a one-month no-ad subscription to Hulu (that's what I did) -- it is well worth it and I daresay you will not be disappointed,",10
"Very realistic account so far worth a watch","Some Americans are complaining about the use of English to describe discussions in Portuguese. This is the norm for many period shows. English in an English accent is typically used.The show obviously needs to skip parts, but the tension is really described in both books much better, , Clavels Shogun and the original Pilot's Samurai William (a must read). Almost 500,000 Japanese had converted to Christianity and the Portuguese had been wrecking homogeneity of Japanese culture. Almost 30% of the Daimiyos had converted and had dual loyalties. They were causing havoc in Japan.In Samurai William the politics were even better described even between Spanish and Portuguese. The pope had given Japan to Portugal but the Spanish using the earlier Tordesilas treaty onsidered Japan theirs too.Lastly the show does miss the mastery of languages William/ John is described as knowing in the book. Fluent in English, Dutch, Portuguese and later mastery of Japanese.The acting of the Japanese characters is top notch , the European characters well seems to be a bit over the top.",9
"Really enjoyed it","I didn't read the book, so I can only judge it based on the S1. The pacing in early episodes is quite slow but if it was faster, I think it would miss some of the nuances.-Story is good, smart, and has lots of depth
-Acting is very good too. Mariko, especially at the latter episodes was nothing short of amazing. Overall, the restraint the actors acted with, to show the depth of their culture was great. The parts about 2 hearts are so well done.-Music and visuals and costumes also well done.Overall, I really enjoyed it and completely did not expect how last 3 episodes turned out. I could sorta predict the ending, but nevertheless, how it was unveiled, was so classy.10/10 for me.",9
"Meticulously crafted. Best show of 2024 so far.","Shogun is a meticulously crafted piece, with its writers, showrunners, performers and, of course, James Clavell's source novel all playing their part.Visually it is stunning, from beautiful vistas to the recreated city of 17th century Osaka; from the samurai armour to the fishermen's robes.Yet this is much more than style. The characters are vividly brought alive. There are lots of them, and it may take the viewer a couple of episodes to keep track of the various Japanese Lords and ladies, and their complex fealty, animosity, their loyalty and their duplicity.Among the many star turns, perhaps the standout performances are from Anna Sawai as Mariko and Tadanobu Asano as Yabishige. Sawai expresses so much depth through stillness, a glance, a pause. She is in many ways the heart of the story and an incredible balance of outcast and influence. Asano stands our for other reasons: his expressive mannerisms, his scheming and his doubts.A word too for the score from Atticus Ross, Leopold Ross and Nick Chuba. Like much in this show, it sits in balance- dramatic when merited, at other times subtle.A glorious show, unlike much else these days. For every familiar seeming beat there is a surprising turn, yet it all comes together with little cliche.Best show of 2024 so far.",9
"The series we needed!","After watching the first two episodes, I was amazed by this series and I cannot wait for the new episode to arrive. Shogun reminds me of Marco Polo, which was a really great series a few years ago that was unfortunately canceled after the second season. A big plus is that the series is in Japanese. On the other hand, I would just wish the Portuguese and Jesuits would speak Portuguese, but English is still acceptable. I like the main actors as they seem very suitable for their roles. So far, the series can relate to the 1980 Shogun, but even if the storyline changes, I have no doubts that it will live up to our expectations.",8
"Hit the target audience","I've think the show is amazing, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. But when it first started with only two episodes out, I couldn't help but feel the need to tell some people to pipe down a bit. Calling it next Game of Thrones already. Since GOT ended, there's been a flood of shows and movies being dubbed as the new Game of Thrones. Sometimes it's Game of Thrones with pirates like ""Black Sails"", or Game of Thrones in space, as seen in ""Dune"" and Apple TV's ""Foundation."" Other times, shows like ""Wheel of Time"" and ""The Witcher"" received comparisons that eventually died down. Don't get me wrong, I actually like all of those, but I'm just a bit tired of the ""this is the new GOT!!"" hype.But this show is actually quite good and refreshingly different, especially since it's set in Japan. Starting to admire Anna Sawai, having seen her in Monarch Legacy and now in Shogun. Apparently, she was also in F9. The show delves into a lot of Japanese lore, like beliefs and samurai culture, although I can't vouch for its accuracy. I've learned a lot about Japanese culture, particularly their dedication to rituals and customs. Hiroyuki Sanada seems to have a penchant for playing samurai or sword fighters: 47 Ronin (2013), John wick, bullet train, mortal combat, avengers endgame.Despite my reservations about calling it the next Game of Thrones, the show does have a strong political undertone, with different factions vying for power and the looming threat of civil war. Something small that I like was the show's title sequence.While the show is generally well-executed, it feels a bit odd to have the Japanese characters speaking Japanese and the Portuguese speaking Portuguese, yet having Portuguese dialogue in English lol. Japanese is subtitles. There are some things I might have missed explanations for, like the peculiar condition of Regent Ohno's skin.Many people compare it to Game of Thrones, but I find it more akin to Vikings, albeit less violent than expected. It leans more towards being a political drama at the moment, although there are hints of impending war. My only gripe is that it seems to shy away from on-screen violence, with many fights and deaths occurring off-screen. It's gory at times, but it teases so many epic battles and wars, and with one episode left, we still only get glimpses of them. Even if the last episode is just one epic battle sequence, I'll still feel the same.Now, I absolutely adore this show. It's a rare case, akin to ""Godzilla: Minus One,"" where the show/movie perfectly hits its target audience. ""Godzilla: Minus One"" was almost exclusively watched by fans of Godzilla and similar genres (myself included); everyone watching knows what to expect. I believe Shogun is predominantly being watched by its intended audience. Even though a show or movie can be amazing, it's very rare for it to receive purely positive reviews. And I think that's what's happening with Shogun - it's an amazing show mainly being watched by its target audience.",8
"A relatedness of belonging to the here-now - A treatsie in rising values","I am writing this section as I am experiencing the here-after, even though the here-now rears as the child of fifty. Ponder this question at will: has the abomination of the clear and sufficient stream of duration been enough for the child? This question is of a different tonal character than what has come before. The history of the English (let us call it that), the abolished and intricate web of flesh, has long since been present in the philosophical inquiry of the great Brentano. I will not be lengthy in this matter, but would withdraw any statements about the ""Sho gun"" (as it is correctly spelled!) and the ""Sho gin"" (as is customary for the apparition). Furthermore, this has been explained as a tower, a rising value of effort that encapsulates three different movements (again this magic number!). The way the English, or hereafter simply Man, adapts the here-now as a junction of positions is never quite clear. Nonetheless, returning to this ""review"" 400 days later, the notion appears sufficient.",9
"Not convinced by Blackthorne","Blackthorne came across pretty limited in his acting and seemed to be bumbling nonsense half the time with a constant look of bewilderment on his face. This made sense the first episode as the lad was shipwrecked after all, but after a promising start he just stagnated with the same go to acting techniques.A pity as the show has a lot of really points, such as scene settings, costumes, customs, etc. But if your main character isn't firing..I thought more of Japan life and culture could have been portrayed outside of quite a narrow militaristic prism which the show focused on, through for example some other character side plots. These would have complimented the show a bit more.",7
"Father please forgive them","Cause they dont know what they are ratingYes its a great story , we all think that - and I love the story , the book is amazing, the mini serie from the 80is is fabolous, but this,,,, abomination,,, is an insult , I looked forward to see a modern version, new thinking and todays effects , instead it came out a fast sloppy written low budget story with acting reminding schooltheatreA guy at my work said to me "" oh you should see this serie called shogun, they have swords and sht, its so good "" so I said ok you should see the original from the 80is instead,, and he looked at me and said "" Ã¶hh do they have swords also "" so when you wonder who put 10 on this serie,,, guys like thisThe story is great, but this version is garbage and just look on the original instead , I know I step on toes and swear in the church but I got so tired on people like this and dont know how much better this actually is.",3
"The best series of the year?","Quality show. Excellent acting performances all-round.CGI isn't outstanding, but used discreetly and sparingly. There's also some unnecessary ""girlbossification"", but not too insulting. It just reduces the Mariko character somewhat.They cut back on the cringe, though, and the sappy romance too.The main gripe is that Blackthorne is even more meaningless than before. He functions essentially as a narrative device only in this one. An observer.The main stand out is definitely Tadanobu Asano. He lights up every scene he's in, and the last face he wears in the show... I swear I could see Kakihara again! Everyone's favourite psychopath :)",9
"Trust the ratings","I do not care about ads or previous makes and models of this show. I do not care about the inconsistencies with the Portuguese and English, that's crazy! Trust the high ratings, but you have to be into this genre of content. It's made for history lovers with good taste. The show is awesome, plain and simple. It is both captivating and inspiring, so if you came to be entertained then you came to the right place. Acting is so beyond phenomenal I don't remember the last time I was this hooked to a show and angry after every episode because I wanted more. It's very obvious this show was never even intended to be 100% historically accurate but it's so congruent to the factual narrative that it's just so damn good.",9
"Shogun is great tv, but not a 10","Not sure where all these 10's are coming from, Shogun is excellent television for sure, but the obvious heavy handed CGI takes me right out of the narrative a lot of time, and it's a shame. But such is big budget scifi and historical pieces these days. I don't remember seeing the previous iteration on television back in the 80's I think, but this one's got all the right ingredients, and I'm also not sure how faithful it is to the original source material. Seems like it's a blockbuster breakout hit which can only be a positive, but I'd rather see more practical sets and less CGI is all I'm saying.",8
"The book and history","The show, the plot porsuit the book and tale by James Clavell.But not in accurate way. I saw all the episodes, include number 4.I reed the book several times, and I saw the 1980's series.This show, again it is not accurate woth the book. But, I thin taht they try to be more exactly with the historic period and , after the end of the 4 episode tray to explain the events who actually hapend in the real history.So Lord Toranaga, or the caracter of Hiroyki Sanada is more similar to Tokuhawa Leyasu than the idea in rhe book.The complexity of this plot is superb than I expected. What next?",10
"Great miniserie that will divide opinions","The atmosphere in this one was perfect. It took me a few episodes to truly appreciate it, and i had some problems getting fully into it. I wasn't sure if Cosmo Jarvis was the right person for the role, or if it was about the character itself.Also in the beginning it had moments where I was thinking ""is this one of those shows which literally has no surprises, and all of the outcomes are very predictable, therefore boring"". Turned out that it was quite the opposite.Coming to the last episode I knew it is going to raise some eyebrows and leave some people disappointed. No great battles, we don't get to see and live the story till the end of times etc.But try to see this with any expectations and just try to enjoy it. Great story and great stories inside the main story, in it's beauty and sadness. It's not always about massive fighting scenes and adrenaline rushes, not always only the bad guys get killed.Thank you.",9
"Realy good TV show!","I didn't had big expectations, as almost every production in the last years is a crap. But ""Shogun"" made my day, and it did it big time! I have not read the book, but i've seen the original series in my childhood. It has good plot, it is visually realy good to wach. Some of the scenes that i remember are missing, but still, i understand the story now better. The only small downside is, it is all in Japanise and there are subtitles most of the time. However, this is not an issue at all so far. And most of all- the cast is great, especialy with Hiroyuki Sanada in the lead! There are also no external, forced and made up characters there.",10
"Utterly outstanding, few shows have reached these heights.","Absolutely astonishing and marvellous show; having read the book several times I was looking forward to this, but have been totally overwhelmed by precise way the show goes through the story and portrays the delicate character interaction.The sets and scenery are astounding and you are given a a sense of the beauty, sadness and futility of medieval Japan.The acting is incredible and Anna Sawai is absolutely perfect in portraying Mariko, one of the most complex characters in the book.Can't wait for the last episode. If this was a film it would fully deserve all the Oscars.Don't worry about the Japanese or the subtitles, it's just immense.",10
"Amazing drama!","I don't find this show particularly clever in many ways. But it brings to the stage the Japanese culture, which unfortunately isn't very well represented and explored. It's a bit poor and even clumsy, Honestly! It could have a better plot; a Portuguese cast and real church scenes would bring it to another level, enriching the whole show. I like the fact that it is spoken in Japanese, but let's get real: why on earth is Portuguese spoken in English? That is plain stupid, just unacceptable, particularly because the Portuguese got to Japan a lot before everyone else, and believe it or not, they founded Osaka. I just can't imagine the cultural shock between these two completely different worlds that is not even touched. The show surely has plenty of room to expand once Japan's culture is so vast! About the drama, well, the quality is absurdly huge and taken to an emotional state where everyone commits suicide for no reason, at least to the Western eyes. Again, another questionable production error because the scenes lack significant context. There is something universal about it, which is a highly irresistible romantic love between a woman shattered by her life who has indisputably zero reasons to keep living except for her deep sense of obligation to serve a higher purpose. The show is almost abridged to a stranger who somehow was able to navigate across the oceans in a period when routes were well-kept just to find a way to a very special woman's heart! I can't help you; I'm a romantic fool.",8
"Overrated and lacks soul","This is one of the most overrated shows in 2024. I started watching with no background on the novel or the first show, nor I had any high expectations. But episode after the other I lose more interest and push myself hard to keep watching just for the sake of closure.I generally like Sanada and enjoy his performance. And I love quality Japanese drama, especially the Samurai era. But sadly I couldn't find anything attention worthy in this show.The show lacks any kind of depth, real struggles, or quality surprises. At the contrary, it feels flat and hollow. It feels more like ""random"" than ""predictable"".I think that the real problem is the lack of a coherent plot that structures the show. Throughout the show, all events and characters feel like ""they're just there"", but no well structured plot that give you a reason to keep watchingOn a mildly positive node, Sanada's performance is good, so is Javris but to a lesser degree. Anna Saway starts well then she becomes a bit boring. Nikaido and Kouri are absolute cringe!It feels like a waste of time. Won't recommend it.",4
"Lots to love","I don't know enough about Japanese history to be able to comment on its accuracy, so this review is just about the entertainment aspect.Two episodes in and I'm hooked. I love the writing, casting, directing, cinematography, the plot(s), the balance of CGI/sets, soundtrack and pace. It's even made me want to go and learn about 17th Century Japan in detail.I have few criticisms of it, but if I were to pick a main one, then it would be the speed that some of the key players are introduced. Being the ignorant Westerner that I am, it's a bit of a struggle early doors to keep up with all the names and places.If you don't mind something that's, at times, a bit brutal and if you're better able than me to keep up with the names, then I think this is well worth a watch and highly recommended it.",9
"The cinema, the photography, the costumes are amazing!","I am barely into the first episode and I'm hooked. The mannerism the costumes and the period exactness is extraordinary. I'm so excited about watching this show. I can tell already that it's going to be amazing and the detail is mind-blowing. Thank you FX for producing a show so well put together just in the first episode.I hope this show exhibits extraordinary. Yes, to the point that being precise with communication and. Pieces are so important to produce an exceptional things to watch. We need to include honest history and respect cultures and how they communicate without an interpretation that is not truthful.",10
"Exceptional","Probably one of the best TV series I've ever seen, completely exceptional. Incredible direction, screenplay, acting, everything was just fantastic. Highly recommend the show to anyone.Having visited personally visited Osaka Castle, it was truly spectacular to see the directors and produces of this show take the audience back to such an incredible time in Japanese history.The character development is exceptional in the show, and the scenery and CGI of Osaka castle is just fantastic. This truly is incredible TV show that I would highly recommend anyone interested to watch. Well done to all involved.",10
"A Must-Watch","Shogun's an amazing show rooted in its era of warring states. But there's not so much on-screen war and bloody battles as there is the slow build-up of events that lead to war. This show manages to create just as much tension in conversations with powerful Japanese Samurai lords as a full-scale battle. It adheres to the subtleties of Japanese culture, politics, its intricate yet strained history with religious influence, and beautiful landscapes and also adheres to the source material it came from by James Clavell. You will come to realize that almost all of its characters are depictions of famous historical figures from that critical era of Japan's history and once those connections are made, your experience of the show will only get better.But while it's an accurate historical adaptation and an accurate adaptation to the source material it came from, the show beautifully has some swerves and tweaks to the story that help to elevate its themes of duty, honor, ascension to rulership, and one's legacy leaving its mark on the world.",10
"A redo done that honours the original","I am rarely a fan of re-doing shows and movies. Let the original stand and speak for the story. In this case though, I am exceptionally impressed. The character development is well done with Cosmo Jarvis' portrayal of John Blackthorne even better in my opinion to Richard Chamberlain's. Anna Sawai is amazing as Lady Toda Mariko and Hiroyuki Sanada is a shoe-in for Lord Toronaga.I first read Shogun in 1981 after seeing the original mini-series. The show and the book created a huge desire to see Japan and an appreciation for the culture and the people.Only two episodes in and I hope the remaining eight continue to capture the essence of this great story.",10
"Finally a worthy successor to Marco Polo","Despite the thickheaded main character, everything else seems to fall into place. For those of us who have seen the original mini series, it is to be said that the first seven episodes almost exactly copy the ones from 1981. And i have watched them again, safe to say they still hold up and are as brilliant as ever. I would rate the english spoken amount at about 30%. Although that is supposed to be portugese, well we all have to make concessions somewhere u guess. I am truely amazed by the level of authenticity, even though some of the japanese characters act somewhat modern. What might the next season have in store for us?",9
"There should be a 12/10 rating","That's just how good this show is so far. Initially hesitant due to its slow start, it quickly gains momentum, demanding full attention-not ideal for multitasking. The episodic release, reminiscent of traditional TV, is a downside. However, its exploration of stoicism and the dissection of virtues lost in modern Western culture is both profound and enlightening. This series not only entertains but also educates, making it a must-watch for those seeking depth and reflection in their viewing experience. The characters are well-developed, and the plot twists are genuinely surprising, making each episode a delight to watch.",10
"Past Perfected","This series is truly exceptional, easily ranking as one of the finest historical dramas I've had the pleasure of watching. My personal criterion for judging historical productions hinges on their ability to immerse me completely, making me forget the presence of a film crew and the artifice of cinema. In this respect, the series excels spectacularly, enveloping me in its historical milieu with such authenticity that the modern world falls away.While the storytelling itself may not always reach the highest levels of narrative complexity or innovation, what truly captivates me is the series' atmospheric depth and its respectful adherence to historical accuracy. The creators' commitment to not tampering with historical facts enhances the authenticity, making each scene and character interaction more engaging and believable.While it would be unfair to compare any series directly to 'Game of Thrones' given its unique place in television history, I must confess that this series approaches that high watermark in terms of its immersive quality. It is rare to find a production that so successfully obscures the line between past and present, viewer and scene. Each episode feels less like watching a show and more like peering through a window into history itself.The meticulous attention to detail, combined with the series' ability to maintain the integrity of the historical narrative, ensures that the atmosphere remains unbroken and genuinely reflective of the era it portrays. For those like me, who value the seamless illusion of historical narratives and a strong atmospheric presence over intricate plot developments, this series stands out as a near-perfect exemplar of the genre.",9
"Well made, cinematic, realistic and also boring.","Initially, I was really drawn to this series; it's visually stunning, and the cinematography is absolutely top-notch. The aesthetic appeal of the show, combined with well-crafted dialogues, made for an engaging experience right from the start. However, as the series progressed, it started to feel like the plot was being unnecessarily stretched out to extend the number of seasons.Moreover, I was particularly disappointed with how some character arcs were handled. After investing so much time in watching the buildup, the unsatisfying conclusions for certain characters left me feeling let down.Although I'm likely to continue watching, I'm leaning towards waiting until all the seasons are released and the story is fully concluded. This way, I can binge the series in one go and hopefully avoid the potential disappointment of having to wait for a payoff that might not live up to the buildup.",7
"The actor who plays Blackthorne in Shogun is terrible, rest is good enough to kill the tiime.","The actor who plays Blackthorne in Shogun is terrible. Also, poor writing lets down the show. Once the naval crew is captured, they can't act like bosses. The most logical thing should have been to be respectful and stay calm. Since that time, Japan was trading with Europeans its highly unlikely that they wanted to kill the crew without validating their cause.Additionally, the writing struggles to maintain momentum after the initial capture, with the plot lacking depth and the characters falling into predictable archetypes.Also lack of respect to Portuguese language is a major concern. In positive note, costumes and inertial design are up to the standard. Also they use Japanese as primary language which is obvious thing to do.",3
"Feudal feast for the eyes","So far, this series is shaping up to be the next great, I really hope it continues down this path as it has a very strong start with the first two opening episodes. Shogun offers a brutally real look at feudal life without the romanticisation often seen in media set in this period of Japan.I am watching this without watching the older show or reading the novel so am going in blind, so far everything from the sets, the outfits and weaponry are all impressive.As someone who missed out on the hype of some of the big culture hitting shows such as GoT. I intend to stay on the ride for this one! Time will tell if this ends up being the case but so far it certainly is looking promising.Very good start and look forward to more!",9
"Not an improvement on the original.","It's a decent production and from what I remember seems to be faithful to the novel. However, this is clearly another attempt at Hollywood revisionist history. For starters it's filmed in Vancouver. You can tell that the buildings are sets. Within the first 20 minutes there is a samurai being dressed down by a woman. And of course, they had to find a dark-skinned Japanese woman to play Mariko. Interview with Anna Sawai.If you're thinking great, here we go, you'd be correct. Here are excerpts from the LA Times article ""Anna Sawai's 'Shogun' role felt personal: Mariko is 'every woman in Japan who has suffered"", FEB. 25, 2024""I wanted to know that they weren't just trying to do another white savior story,"" says Sawai. ""That they were going to do it right this time.""Her ""layer of contemporary attitude,"" as Marks calls it, is what enables audiences to see Mariko as a sympathetic character. It's rooted in Sawai's awareness of the various Hollywood tropes and misrepresentations that have plagued Japanese women onscreen for decades.""I didn't want it to be another depiction of Japanese women being sexualized by white men,"" says Sawai. ""I wanted this to be the right portrayal of women.""--Shogun was great because it was an accurate portrayal of feudal Japan. This may have been, if not for the attempt to modernize it. Which begs the question, if you're not creating your own production, with your own artistic interpretation, then why remake it? Why, indeed?",9
"I enjoyed it, but I would have loved it even more if there were more action scenes.","I don't want to get too philosophical, but despite expecting a series with more thrilling scenes, I was somewhat disappointed in that regard. However, it strangely influenced my perspective on life. It made me realize how close the line between life and death is and how important it is for someone to not be so afraid of what they believe in. I think modern life has distanced us from this reality. We've become a generation filled with fear, where our lives are so precious that we can't even protest for our simplest rights without fear. Overall, this series sticks in my mind, especially the beautiful dialogue: 'We Live and We Die'.",8
"A rare but welcome masterpiece","It took no more than a few minutes to realize that Shogun is a masterpiece. Every aspect is a 10/10. The camerawork, the script, the pacing, the cast & every other aspect. Further, if you love Japanese culture and history - then this is one of the best and most faithful re-imagines out there. A big emphasis has been put into accuracy and authenticity, Shogun is a joy to watch, a joy for all senses. ThereÂ´s even an official online site where you can read about all the characters, places and different cultural themes depicted in the series. Me and my son wondered why the highborn women walked in a very special way in the serie - on this site we could read about that, this was a cultural thing in Japan with strict rules - fascinating. This level of pure love for the project produced is a joy to be part off. I even got a new streaming service just to watch this and I hate streaming services and try to never have any.Further more, I wanna emphasis the refreshing absence of the modern obsession for inclusion and idiot producers that wanna ""do their own thing"". I cant with written words describe how tired I am of this. Watching a serie off a franchise that I already have deep love for, only to discover that the (idiot) producer has chosen to do ""their own thing"" instead of actually honoring the franchise they have gotten the rights to. Also, the fact that there are NO attempts to include meaningless diversity in the cast is so refreshing. All in-movie Japanese characters are played by Japanese people. As a Swede, I would be extremely disappointed seeing blue-eyed blond samurais (which we donÂ´t), we donÂ´t need diversity in pictures - we need authenticity and quality and that is what has been done here. The exclusion of these two modern and extremely compromising features helps elevate this masterpiece even higher than the already mint production.Shogun is a new timeless classic that will be re-watched for years to come.",10
"Why is it that only those who have never fought in a battle are so eager to be in one?","The series ""Shogun"" is an exciting historical drama set in Japan at the beginning of the XVII century. It is based on James Clavell's novel of the same name.The plot centers on the story of English navigator John Blackthorn, who finds himself in the Land of the Rising Sun, closed to Europeans.

Their interaction on the screen is one of the brightest advantages of the series.Blackthorne's relationship with Japanese society and its allies, including Lady Mariko, shows how difficult cultural exchange is.Jarvis convincingly demonstrates how his character changes: from a lost sailor to a respected samurai. In a conversation with Toranaga, Jarvis shows a strong inner tension and determination. This makes the scene fascinating and filled with emotional depth.Director's work:The director's work in the series ""Shogun"" is performed at a high level.

And the 9th episode was recognized as the most highly appreciated in the series.The scene of Blacktoran's return to England is the final scene of the series. It shows how the hero returns home after many years spent in Japan. This scene evokes a sense of nostalgia and completes the story of the main character.The shipwreck scene in the first episode is one of the most memorable in the series. The directors perfectly conveyed the chaos and fear that gripped the ship's crew during the storm. The camerawork was also excellent: the shots taken from different angles created the feeling that the viewer was on a ship.The author of the script and the director:Screenwriters Rachel Kondo, Justin Marks and Emily Yoshida have created a wonderful story and vivid characters. They did a great job.In the script of the series, everything is thought out to the smallest detail, it is logical and consistent.

It shows how Blackthorn is trying to adapt to a new culture and the difficulties he faces.Camerawork:The work of the cameramen in the series ""Shogun"" deserves high praise. Sam McCurdy, Mark Lalibert Ells and Christopher Ross were able to convey the beauty and grandeur of Japan at the beginning of the XVII century, creating a unique visual atmosphere of the series.

The cinematography and special effects are performed at a high level. The actors also demonstrated impressive fighting skills.Musical accompaniment:The musical accompaniment in the series ""Shogun"" deserves high praise. Composers Nick Chuba, Atticus Ross and Leo Ross have created unique music that perfectly emphasizes the mood and atmosphere of the series. Music adds epicness and helps the viewer to immerse themselves deeper into the era in which events are taking place.The scene in which Blackthorn sees Mariko for the first time is one of the most romantic in the series. It shows Blackthorne and Mariko's first meeting. Actors Cosmo Jarvis and Anna Sawai played their roles perfectly, creating an atmosphere of love and excitement.Editing, frame composition, special effects:The editing in the series ""Shogun"" was performed at a high level. Maria Gonzalez, Aika Miyake and Thomas A. Kruger created a dynamic and fascinating rhythm of the series, without losing the logic and consistency of the plot.The frame composition and special effects are done perfectly, they create a unique visual aesthetic of the series, which is admirable.The battle scenes are the apotheosis of the entire series. She is amazing thanks to the amazing camerawork, special effects and acting. The viewer finds himself in suspense from the first seconds.Literary work:The series ""Shogun"" is based on the novel of the same name by James Clavell. The director's concept of the series generally corresponds to the literary source, but at the same time there are some unique moments in the series that make it even more fascinating.Comparison with other films:The series ""Shogun"" can be compared to such historical dramas as ""The Last Samurai"" or ""Kingdom of Heaven"". However, ""Shogun"" has its own unique atmosphere and style that set it apart from others.""Shogun"" can be compared to ""Game of Thrones"" because of its epic scope and political intrigue, but this series has its own unique atmosphere.Personal impressions:The series is full of unexpected twists and keeps the viewer in suspense until the very end. It is impossible to predict what will happen next, and political intrigues and plot twists do not allow you to relax for a minute.""Shogun"" is a true masterpiece of historical cinema, which deserves the highest praise. The series captivates from the first minutes and keeps you in suspense until the very end, leaving a lot of emotions and food for thought after watching.

"One of the best shows ever made","Wow, where do I even begin.First off I thought having to read subtitles was going to be a chore because I hate reading subtitles. But the writing and characters are so good that I got lost in the words and forgot about that. I just finished watching sopranos for the 50th time and this show is close to as good as sopranos. Whoever the screenwriters are they need a mass payrise, the. Script is amazing. I just watched the 5th episode where they are drinking sake in the home and the writing was sublime and then the shot with the arrow blew my head off. All I can say is wow, wow, wow, wow, just an amazing show. Please someone in. Hollywood watch this show. And realise this is what we want. DEI is dead, we want authenticity.",10
"Amazing, smart, and draws you in...","Have watched the first two episodes, and I have nothing but praise. This is totally head and shoulders above the 1980 version, as it should be, otherwise why make it. I thought it is brilliant to have the Japanese cast speaking Japanese with subtitles. Definitely adds to the feeling of being present in feudal Japan. I finished reading the Clavell book a couple of weeks ago, and so far these episodes are very close to the narrative in the book. The casting is superb. Pretty much every character has quite a lot of depth and for the most part are what I imagined they would be. From what I heard, the director and production team did extensive research about this era in Japanese history, and their care shows. My opinion so far is that Game of Thrones has nothing on this series. Looking forward to watching this story play out on the screen.",10
"Full Series Review: Fell short of what it could be","I'm not familiar with the book, so I will evaluate the show on its own after having watched it all twice.I think it has one of the strongest starts of any series I've ever watched. The writing starts off very strong, and the cinematography, attention to detail, set pieces, costumes, music, acting, everything is so incredibly top notch that its breathtaking.All of that remains the case throughout the show, except for the story.Everything about this show is a buildup towards the last episode, where the grand plan of the true central character is revealed. All the intrigue, all the machinations, all the politics, it all is building up to something. The show does a good job of keeping you interested and curious for answers, but those answers are also what the entire show's writing hinges upon.And they are not answered well at all. Furthermore, the climax of the story... happens after the series ends! One of the most famous battles in Japanese history is merely mentioned. The ultimate plan of the main character does not even come to fruition, nor is it explained how his plan even made sense. To the degree we got answers, they dont even make sense.Overall, I did not expect to say this about what seems to be a faithful novel adaption... But the writing is by far the weakest part. Perhaps they could have taken more liberties in adapting a book that perhaps was great in transporting us to Medieval Japan, but was overall lacking in proper story structure.",7
"Most overrated show ever","So what is good about the show? Scenery, visuals, acting perhaps.But hell it is so boring. It never really takes off. What was this finale please? Most boring show finale ever.In the beginning the show tries to be shocking by obscene violence but that later on fizzles out.But throughout I often found myself not very interested in watching further.The biggest issue is that Toranaga's Master plan is not really all that surprising. It is clear from episode 6 or so what kind of person he really is. Basically all the interesting characters died for his greed and power hunger. That is literally what the show is about in the end. But it comes across super bland because not really surprising or tense or anything.Also the main character Anjin Blackthorne does not come across very interesting to me. He is way too clean in character and I wish he could have been a bit more of twisted mind himself.That is why I felt also the story between Blackthorne and Mariko is super run of the mill. Okay I get it, it is an adaptation from an earlier version where it was like this. But I found the love story somehow super boring and not convincing. Just like super predictable and too much of ""Foreinger comes to exotic country, married woman falls in love in with him and vice versa"". How many times have we seen this before?Verdict - I really do not get the hype and I do not think it comes anywhere close to the *early* seasons of Game of Thrones. Completely different league.",4
"A Bewildering Yet Beautiful Immersion into 17th Century Japan","""Shogun"" is a visually stunning, elegiac watch but what I loved most is the sheer alienness of the world portrayed.This is no western-style action adventure show where familiar Hollywood heroes are simply transposed into a Japanese setting. Rather, what grips and hooks you is less the drama and twists of the plot, and more the intricacies and mysteries of the culture which fuels the narrative.Admittedly, it's a challenging watch initially. Filmed primarily in Japanese with English subtitles, the writers, directors, and producers make no concessions for viewers' lack of understanding. Nothing is spoon-fed - astonishing for a big-budget television show produced by American and British companies for an American channel (FX and Hulu). Instead, everything unfolds seemingly naturally, a testament to the show's strong writing and direction.As viewers, we are invited to be as bewildered and nonplussed by the land, people and customs as our hero/anti-hero, the marooned ship's pilot, John Blackthorne. Beyond basic plot points, we're left genuinely perplexed by what's happening. Yet, curiously, it doesn't seem to matter.The jokes fly over our heads, the romantic customs baffle us, and unless a character is European, their motivations remain largely impenetrable. The grand strategies and reactions of the competing rulers are equally unfathomable. Despite all this, however, everything feels authentic and internally consistent within the show's world, whether we fully grasp it or not.Gradually, bit by bit, as the episodes progress, events begin to make sense. This mirrors Blackthorne's own growing understanding as he masters the language. We witness his previous hopes and ambitions slowly worn down by the all-encompassing culture. He's so warped and changed that he abandons his old life entirely. This mirroring effect only deepens the viewer's experience.In short, ""Shogun"" is television immersion at its finest. It's a masterclass in bravura filmmaking. If you haven't seen it, you should.",10
"Very solid production","The production scale is magnificent! The costumes, architechture, everything is shown in details and looks like a cinema production(actually, it is, just divided on 10 episodes). Hiroyuki is perfect, I was wondering how Toranaga will look in 2024 when comparing with Toshiro Mifune. Well, it is at least on par with it.The only one reason I am not giving a 10 rate is Cosmo Jarvis. Honestly, I can't imagine how he will raise to Chamberlain's level(I don't mean to copy him), but he is convincing to me. Too much growling, too much bad attitude. Anyway, despite Cosmo, I am counting the days to the next episode (#3).",10
"Brilliant","Did not disappoint at all. Directing Good, Acting Good, Costume Good, Pace and style just as it needed to be Good and Plot starting to look really interesting Scenery as dramatic as i expected very fitting. Hiroyuki Sananda brilliant as usual. Looking forward to the 5th of March. Struggling to remember too much of the original but i do remember enjoying it. I've got to admit i was nervous about this for some reason they seem to get even unmessable things wrong lately but this was great. I do hope the battle scenes are as impressive. All in all i thinkeverybody played thier parts really well which contributed towards a really enjoyable show to watch.",10
"Stunning and intriguing","""Shogun"" is a work that plunges the viewer into the intrigues and conflicts of feudal Japan in a visually stunning way. The production deserves applause for its meticulousness in recreating the settings and historical details, transporting us to a fascinating era. The Japanese actors deliver exceptional performances, bringing authenticity and depth to their roles.However, the choice of non-native actors to portray Portuguese characters is a weak point. Instead of enriching the narrative, this creates a linguistic and cultural disconnect that affects the credibility of the story. Considering the strong influence of Portuguese navigators and Jesuit priests on Japanese culture at the time, it would have been more authentic and faithful to historical events if the Portuguese characters spoke in the Portuguese language.By opting for English representations, an opportunity to explore linguistic diversity and the complexity of interactions between cultures is missed. This choice may leave some viewers questioning the authenticity of the narrative, despite the production's commendable efforts in other aspects. In summary, ""Shogun"" shines in many ways, but stumbles in the representation of Portuguese characters, highlighting the importance of carefully considering all cultural facets when adapting historical events for the screen.",8

"I am calling it a Masterpiece early.","I very rarely write reviews, but I read many. This review is written after seeing the third episode, directed by the Swedish demon director Charlotte BrÃ¤ndstrÃ¶m. Pure genius! I have never given a ten to any series before but this is so well made. Expectations are very high for the remainder of the episodes.At 50+ years of age, watching cinema and TV since the infancy of broadcasting to citizens homes, I have watched many of the greatest creations between 1975 and now.I call this remake of the cult classic original show starring Sir Richard Chamberlain, another cult classic. We just don't know it yet but in ten years, it will be on the top ten all times TV series list here on IMDB, unless its Michael Bay directing the remaining episodes full of nasty CGI.It wouldn't surprise me if the producers bought the complete rights from the late author James Clavell, and there is a spin off series in the making. But who would have the balls to try and write continuance on such a classic piece of literature?The cast is spot on, the set impeccable and the feeling of getting a true glimpse of what it must have been like to visit glorious Nippon - Japan, in the seventeenth century is remarkable to say the least. Now I must wait another week to continue watching when all I want to do here is binge it...A pure joy to watch for anyone who loves good cinema, on TV. 10/10 - my first ever so I don't give that lightly!",10
"amazing historical period drama","This is the best tv series i've seen in so long. I really enjoy historical dramas as I'm a huge history buff and it's amazing to imagine ancient civilizations. The main lord toronaga is one of my favorite actors. He's so genuine in every role.... The Last Samurai, 47 Ronin, John Wick 4, etc. He does the Japanese culture with so much respect and loyalty to proper traditions, roles, and behaviors. But he always dies in his films so he better survive this one!! And the Mariko actress was really good in the Monarch Godzilla series, and she's really amazing in this show. I've rewatched all three episodes a few times already it's so enjoyable. Plus I find things I've missed after seeing it a few times, given the language barrier you need to follow very closely to storylines and events. Amazing amazing amazing in every sense. Wardrobes, acting, mannerism, sets, cgi is good enough to convey the story and scale of events. Can't wait for episode 4!",10
"WoW!! 10/10","What Can I say. I'm speachless.Whithout a shadow of a doubt The Greatest mini-series of all time.The performances of Mariko-sama and Anjin-sama are out of this world. And of course the amazing performence of Toranega-sama and the underrated performence of yabushige-sama.An all around magnificent package.Since starting the series 3 days ago , I've been thinking about it non-stop.Even The set-pieces and world building and costume design is amazing.I've just finished ep.09 - which for me is one of the greatest episodes in TV history- and I've been walking around my room for half an hour now contemplating what I've just seen. I just can't get my head around what happened and it's bugging me sooo much and that's how you can tell how great of a show Shogun is.I paused the episode multiple times out of stress of what's going to happen next.Truly Magnificent Series.I wish I could completely forget it so I could once again watch Anjin-sama and Mariko-sama debate.Their relationship is what makes this series so special to me.Edit :
Just finished ep.10.Cried during and after it ended.I've never seen anything like this.",10
"I really wanted to like this series","First off I did not read the books or watch the previous series and I a at episode 7 at the moment, I love Hiroyuki Sanada, even from the trailes the scenery and cinematography seemed amazing, and then having over 9 stars in IMDB starting off, everything seemed promising, and you can tell there was a lot of care put into the show a lot of the details are very impressive and the violent scenes are very realistic and impacting for sure that was all well setup in the first episode, and I understand why a lot of the fans of the old Japanese culture would love this, I like it but I am no fan compared to these people, but after episode 7 I confirmed my worst fear, the writing got lazy and dumb.First of all I want to talk about the blackthorne actor, I really think he was a mistake, probably the worst one of the show, his voice is amazing but he should stick with voice acting, every scene he is on feels like an amateur trying to impress his dad, all his gestures, face expressions and movements are just a pain to watch not to mention he looks like a 14 year old on a giant body, he just looks too innocent to be the character he is trying to be and whats worse does some things that I think were meant to be badass but it just ended up looking ridiculous, stealing the light on all the other great elements of this show, not to mentio his character arc makes no sense, he kinda grows, but then he doesn't and goes back to being a primitive ape trying to seem ballsyAnd now as for the writing, the last straw for me was (SPOILER ALERT) a certain someone slipping to his death, is it supposed to be shocking? I guess it was, but probably on an unintended way, hell it was even funny to some degree but with things like these it's hard to take this show seriously and I really feel for those who did their best job to make this series great, their work is overshadowed primarily by Blackthorne and some of the writing confusing decisions, and this is coming from someone who is entirely new to this story, no books or previous TV series knowledge at all, but I hear they are making some dumb changes to the book and I think it is true.I am kinda hoping that these last few episodes and the seemingly dumb writing pays off in some way I am not able to understand yet, but right now that hope does not seem something worth holding on to. I am probably going to finish it anyway, it's not like it is too bad that it is intolerable either, but it is definitely overrated, I'd give it a 7.5, but I'm going with 6 simply because it does not deserve to be over 9 at this moment, I'd let an 8 pass, maybe even 8.5 knowing the strong wave of Japanese culture fans all over the world that would be blind to the negative aspects of the show, but 9 it's just an insult to other series that do deserve it. Feels like a ghost of Tsushima thing all over again, I also wanted to like it only to find out it was just a prettier assasin's creed with slightly better gameplay but it was nowhere near the masterpiece people seemed to think it was, even as far as believing it deserved game of the year over The Last of Us Part 2, just cuz they were not mature enough to appreciate a great story.",6
"Great Series But NOT Shogun","This is a great series Sanada and Sawai are absolutely stunning. But this series should not be called Shogun. It is so far removed form the source material that I am at a loss as to understand why the Clavell estate didn't put their legal foot down and stop production. The story vaguely follows the timeliness of the book but places so much emphasis on the development of the characters of Toranaga and Mariko that it does a severe disservice to the essential element of the book. Which is Blackthorne's slow and inexorable assimilation into the Japanese culture. It also glosses over the basic antagonistic relationship between the Catholic and Protestant Characters in the novel. A really rousing series but it is so different from the novel as to be almost unrecognizable.",2
"Shogun: a chess game with all the pieces in place but only one player was awarded of it.","'Shogun' is more than just a show; it's a brilliant plan unfolding step by step. From the start, it's like a game of chess, with every move carefully thought out. The way they reveal who wins is just genius. What makes it special is how they mix in love and betrayal, making every moment count. Every character's journey feels important, adding depth to the story. And the best part? It lets you think for yourself, making it exciting every time.The last episode is really satisfying. They tie up all the loose ends and give closure to the stories, which is amazing. It all makes sense, showing how every chess piece was used wisely. Some characters die, but it's done in a meaningful way. They don't cheat by bringing them back.About that spoiler: how they show who wins the battle without actually showing it is just wow. It proves 'Shogun' doesn't need big battles to be exciting. Adding one would have made it less special.",10
"""Shogun"" is a true hidden treasure of a series.","""Shogun"" is a true hidden treasure of a series.

The subtitles, seamlessly translating Japanesse dialogue into English, enhance the show's ambiance. With a stellar cast delivering superior performances, each episode leaves you craving more. Ending at the same point as the book it's based on, the series tantalizingly leaves room for a sequel but with out any more source meterial every thing from now on would be New and Depend solely upon the Writers.

"A must watch!!!","""Shogun"" is a must-watch for anyone into gripping historical dramas. Set during the early days of Tokugawa Ieyasu's reign, the show immerses you in feudal Japan like never before. The attention to detail in the sets and costumes is mind-blowing, making you feel like you've stepped right into the 17th century. Plus, the acting is top-notch, with every cast member delivering performances that draw you in and keep you hooked from start to finish. From the intense political maneuvering to the breathtaking visuals, ""Shogun"" earns a solid 10/10 for its compelling storytelling and immersive world-building.",10
"The ending is perfect to me","I finished the 10 episodes in 2 weekends. It's the best show in a while. Maybe the best show after the first 4 seasons of GOT.First, the acting is simply superb. All the main characters were portraited with such details and subtlety that it's a pure joy to watch. Mahershala Ali won Oscar because he can act with his eye expressions. After watching this series, you will realize that all the main Japanese actors can do it! The smirk on Toranaga's or the smile on Yabushige before he dies was just epic. Obviously Anna Sawai, who played Mariko and Sanada, who played Toranaga, are stars of the show. But Fuji, Yabushige and Kazunari were all excellently portraited with such charm and finesse. The overall acting is 8/10. The points lost were from the main character Cosmo Jarvis who played Blackthorne. His acting was robotic and superficial, and not on par with the rest of the crew. However, maybe this is by design, to illustrate that the character was out of place.Second, the characters. The producers of the show are great story-tellers. Each character carries their own story and therefore their own charm, giving the show such richness to savor. Obviously, this was not possible without the superb acting and directing, on top of the great book.Visuals. Sometimes they used wide angle lenses that deliberately gave some distortions, and sometimes they used lenses with obviously vignetting (the corners appear dark), and they masterfully didn't correct them. Such photographing gave a very unique feeling as if you are watching a real event through a camera lens. The sceneries, especially the Japanese gardens, yards, meeting rooms etc, are esthetically appealing. The Japanese costumes, including the traditional clothing and warrior armors, feel like visiting a live museum!Last but not least, the story was a master piece. I always like series based on true events such as Narcos. Dramatized real events make the best TV. This one is no exception. Nothing felt artificial or strange. All pieces fit well. Some people complain about the ending, claiming it was epic. However, I argue that the ending was perfect. We have seen the main characters and their stories. In the end, we see the real face of Toranaga, the Shogun. And the genius of the Blackthorne character is that it provides a Western view of the characters and events. The most important character of Blackthorne is his empathy for human life, which is in direct conflict with the disregard of human lives way in 17th century Japan, and he provided a bridge to modern viewers. The ending offered a shock without an epic battle scene, and in my view, done masterfully.",10
"Riviting","I cannot find a flaw with acting , direction , nor writing .Such a fantastic show , special effects top notch feel like your in old time Japan and the customers and sets awesome.This is possibly the next big tv show , after GoT .I look forward to Monday nights when the new episode airs .Really makes for a great evening ,The actors are just brilliantly cast , Blackthorn better than say Tom Hardy ( whom I bet they tried to get ) .Just finished episode 5 can hardly wait until next week .Do yourself a favour and watch this , this will go down as one of the great tv shows of all time .",10
"So far, so amazing..","If you are going to remake a classic mini series , this is the was to do it. I won't go into the plot of the series but just to say I am so far very impressed at how these first 2 episodes have panned out. The original 1980's series was very impressive for its time and Is worth checking out if you haven't seen it.But this remake has so far proved to be superior in scope and attention to detail and script. The acting and characterisation is sublime.Obviously a lot of research has gone into the production and the casting of the main characters. I would recommend anyone interested in this period of history to check it out.",9
"It's living up to its mark","The anticipation for this show has been crazy, and so far is staying very close to the original story what's sad thing about it is the subtitles are moving so fast you don't have time to read it all which is very disappointing. At this day and time the Japanese language should be represented but slow it down some, we all are not fast readers. The patent tree is absolutely excellent and you're learning the true culture of the Japanese people in the 16th century which we may see as harsh but what culture isn't harsh. We all don't live in a better roses. I can't wait to see how this is going to end.",8
"This is what television has been missing in recent years","This show was incredible. I have not felt this pulled into a series in years. The only things in recent memory I can compare it to are The Bear and House of the Dragon in terms of the elaborate storytelling and compelling characters. I am yearning for more after the credits role on episode 10, and yet I feel there was no better way for them to have ended it. I adored the characters, and mourn for those that were lost that I had grown fond of. This is the quality I expect from channels such as FX and Max, and I am glad that this series delivered what it promised during all of the marketing prior to its release. A must-watch for drama and period-piece fans. 9/10.",9
"Go Back and Watch the Original","As someone who's a big fan of the original miniseries with Richard Chamberlain, this version leaves a lot to be desired. For starters, the original series is faithful to novel, which is an excellent read (I've read it 3x), whereas this version departs from the original story often. The dark filters and modern music are just dumb choices. No Japanese music for some reason. The best actors in this new version are those playing Toranaga and Kasigi Yabu (no idea where ""Yabushige"" comes from--not in the book or original series). The guy playing Blackthorne is a terrible actor for this role; he comes off like he's about to have a seizure at any moment. So many additional story changes with this version too. For some reason, the writers decided to make Ochiba a conniving, power-hungry woman (not so in the book). Do yourself a favor and watch the original series after this. I think you'll find it's much, much better.",6
"It made me rewatch the far superior 1980s mini series","It's funny that a 10 hour ""mini"" series is actually longer than the 10 episode ""normal"" series of 2024. And this is the main problem with this show, it was ""modernized"" for ""modern"" audiences. Something a show about 17th century feudal Japan does not need.We have all the tropes of modern shows - cliff hangers, extremely long and pointless establishing shots, ""witty"" dialogue, gray and brown tones for ""realism"", and pointless changes to the original story for no apparent reason.Do yourself a favor and watch the 1980s show instead. It's superior in pretty much every way, and was actually shot in Japan, unlike the new one that was shot in Canada for some reason.",1
"Stunning and nostalgic","20 years ago I'd heard about an amazing TV show produced in the 1980's called Shogun. The production took great care of bringing Japanese culture to life. I then began reading all of James Clavell's works. From the multi-hundred page sailing adventures to the meticulous thoughts of hearing every villagers thoughts as events were unfolding.The new series is everything just as good as the original TV production and brings a level of quality that fully modernizes a setting from the 1600's. I got to relive my fond memories of Blackthorne and Mariko.There was sort of fond sadness seeing this show draw to a conclusion. Emotions are displayed in subtle manners which left capacity for my own thoughts and feelings. I remembered how much these works meant to me 20 years ago and I'm lucky to feel the appreciation I have now.",10
"""Flowers are only flowers because they fall""","An absolute masterpiece that leaves you wanting more.We won't ever get more Shogun sadly, but maybe that's for the better, because it was the perfect miniseries.It was so refreshing to see a show cover such a rarely covered time period and setting - 1600s Japan towards the beginning of a period of Christian and European influence.The casting was impeccable for both main and supporting characters, especially the roles of Mariko, Toranaga, and Ochiba. Anna Sawai deserves an Emmy for this one.The score was incredible throughout, the show but really came through when it mattered most - in the finale.The storytelling and character development really are what shine through though. While Shogun will draw comparisons to shows like Game of Thrones, is more similar to a game of chess than an action movie. It's poetry in motion and the best miniseries since Band of Brothers.",10
"From writing, acting and production standpoint, it's probably the best show I've ever seen!","I've never read the source material and I hardly ever write reviews, so when I do, it's either very good or very bad. This show was very, very good.These are the few things that I loved about it.I love that a majority of the cast and crew are Japanese as requested by Senada and co. The make up, costumes, set decoration, mannerisms, historical accuracy, time period language etc - all genuine. As this show is based on a book that is based on historical figures, all the authenticity helps the cast to fully immerse themselves into their roles, thereby giving a much more accurate and fuller performance. And with 70% of the show being in the Japanese language, this also helps the audience immerse themselves into the show too.The idea of this show was 11 years in the making. Sanada had been signed up for 8 years, with the Showrunners signed up for the past five years. This is why the show is great because you have actual screenwriters, producers and crew who care about the source material, who care about paying respect to the culture, who care about a craft that they put their heart and soul into. They're not just making a TV show to make the studio some money.Speaking about the writing, it is sublime. Obviously the culture of that era in Japan was rife with poets, but there are casual lines within the show that are just pure gold, e.g. ""if freedom is all you ever live for.. you will never be free of yourself"". This line was not expounded on nor brought up again later, it was just out there as one of many great lines to ponder over.The blood, guts, sex, profanity etc were all necessary in a show about feudal Japan. None of that was avoided. None of that was censored. That was perfect.The fact that the show was not adjusted for 2024 political correctness. For example, we hear men saying things like their wife is their property and they can choose to do what they want with her eg kill her, beat her, sleep with her whenever etc, and not only was this not tuned down, but it was left raw and plain to digest. The show left us audience to recognise that ""no, this is not how you correctly treat people"", ""this is gross"", ""this is disgusting"" etc. We don't need to be spoonfed into one of the characters speaking up about it not being right, the audience knows it's not right - and I love that they let us come to that conclusion.I think the main thing I love about this show is not actually about the show. It's about how the show is presented. This show was released weekly. This makes a huge impact on Shogun's appeal. I think this works in this shows favour because others have said this show felt rushed compared to the book. The Anjin is a prisoner trapped on foreign soil while the audience are trapped to wait another week for a new episode. We also feel like prisoners not able to ""binge watch"" the show. Anticipation is, I feel, key to why this show works so well.lastly: Anna Sawai. Omg she is fantastic in this role! Unbelievably gorgeous. She was completely lost in Monarch Legacy of Monsters, but OWNED this whole show. Her facial expression can convey a thousand words alone. She said in interviews she prefers roles like this that she has a deep connection with, and I hope for all our sakes she gets cast in many more heartfelt roles to come.Come to think of it, I haven't really heard any negative reviews about the show. One of the things that could've been improved on in the last episode is, I didn't buy Anjin's love for the people of Ajiro, at least not enough to kill himself over. We never see him talking to any of the townspeople the same way he had banter with Uejiro. I would've like to see him having a laugh with more of the help - the cooks, cleaners, fisherman, farmers etc as they're his kind of people: labourers.All in all, it is a fantastic show.From a writing, acting and production standpoint, I think it's the best show i have ever seen. Episode five and six are my personal favourites. I must admit I hyped myself up for all out war in the last episode and let myself down, but that was my own doing. I re-watched the final episode and aligned my perspectives, and it is so much better on a rewatch.10/10 Highly recommended!",10
"Can't recommend this show enough","When I first heard about Shogun I couldn't wait to see it because I absolutely loved the original. I then read the reviews and while the majority of them are really good they were still mixed enough that I thought I'd judge for myself? Well, I loved it. I loved it so much I'm already watching it all the way through again. I kept telling myself that there's no way they can keep every episode as entertaining as the last but they did. It just kept getting better and better. Like many have already said it's historically inaccurate. I can get past shows like that as long as it was entertaining enough and this definitely was.",10
"What, No Second Season?","Everything is Perfect in this TV Series! Screen writers overdid themselves. Very nice Costumes, Great Scenery! Very Interesting traditions of the ancient Japan! Captivating Story Line! Good choice of the Cast! Tadanobu Asano is the most talented actor and Anna Sawai is the most Beautiful actress in this Show! In my humble opinion of course. After watching 8 episodes, I just don't want this Lovely Show to stop! I want to continue enjoying it! And please don't tell me, that they don't have enough Money to make season 2. And also I don't believe they wont find someone with Good Imagination, to invent the New and Interesting Story!",10
"It's okay - definitely not 9 out of 10","Was looking forward to this since December. And was very excited to see all of the 9 and 10 ratings.In my opinion this is an okay tv show, one very fitting with fx, but I will not be overly excited to watch the new episodes week on week.The score sounds like something from a daytime tv movie. Any ""tense"" scene has basic drums to try and build tension, which gives the whole show a rather cheap feel.To those comparing this to game of thrones need to go back and watch the first few episodes and remind yourselves how gripping it was.To summarise, it's okay but i wish I had watched it with slightly lower expectations.",10
"The series of the year without a doubt.","We are in the presence, perhaps, of the best series of 2024 despite having been there for so few months.What Shogun has generated may only have had precedents on TV since the time of Games of Thrones.A fantastic story, an incredible casting, unbeatable locations and a direction to take your hat off to.At times it is classified as slow but in my opinion it is a delight to feel the tension of each moment without having to resort to violence.Hiroyuki Sanada's performance is fantastic playing a Toranaga who does not show his cards until the end and leaves you wondering if he is the villain or hero of the story.The character of Yabushige is also portrayed magnificently and shows you the story of someone obsessed with death and who always tries to be on the most convenient side of history.Mariko Sama is another complex character, overwhelmed by the past, not wanting to die until the end of the story as part of the ""crimson sky"" plan that she dies based on the plans that Toranaga had been orchestrating a long time ago.Finally, the character of John, played by Cosmo Jarvis, has multidimensionality in terms of a person who at the end of the story perfectly understands the feeling of living and gradually stops being an arrogant Englishman thinking about war to being another puppet in the story of Toranaga.The secondary characters are all very good, special mention to chapter 4 when Buntaro gets drunk with John...god, the tension that was experienced was fantastic.The historical basis of the story is sublime, and perhaps the last chapter could be anticlimactic considering what chapters 7, 8 and 9 had been, but it still closes in a great way, we saw the result of what they were showing us.Great series.",9
"Finely detailed, engrossing","The effect when you watch such a finely detailed show as this is mesmerizing, it sucks you into the world and time ... and the culture.Before an actor utters a single word in any episode there is the fact and nature of the world building that has been done in order to give them a stage to perform on. In the case of Shogun what has been accomplished is astounding, but it really comes into its own when the camera is tight and the sets and shots are relatively tightly constrained. Up close this world is utterly convincing - the costuming extraordinary.The script is also exceptionally well written and manages to convey a deep sense of Japanese culture (primarily of the upper classes) - but also tells its story very economically - it provides ample opportunity for nuanced communication.This brings us to the actors and the director and cinematographer who captured these subtleties - not easy to do with a light touch, managed here very deftly. The result is a show not over burdened with dialogue that tells part of its story some of its most significant moments, with gesture and response, subtle character action, a glance here, a hand movement, a tilt of the body, or the sweeping swish of fabric before composure again. On this level the show and its actors are quite magnificent - but there is room for special mention.Anna Sawai as Mariko is as refined and elegant as you'd expect from a high born and well educated noblewoman of the era, she is thoroughly steeped in the culture, captured here in very fine detail - Sawai's minute control is truly something to behold - very special indeed. So also Hiroyuki Sanada as Lord Toranaga - another brilliant and subtle performance from this fine actor.I've read some nasty dismissal of Cosmo Jarvis' Blackthorne - they miss the point. Of course he is uncouth, brash, insensitive. Of course his energy clashes with everything around him and he seems clumsy and arrogant and a bit useless. That IS the point, and the reality. His character is completely out of time and place - culturally he may as well be on another planet. The way he walks and moves is an affront to centuries of careful aesthetic, the way he sits, the way he drinks, the way he looks at people - all a culture shock. English arrogance and insensitivity gets a turn in front of the mirror. Well done.This show is sensational and ticks all the boxes - brilliant work by all involved. Not to be missed.",9
"The Failure to Deliver","It was well made, but they set up so many things to happen that just don't go anywhere. The main conflicts lead nowhere ultimately. Another thing I don't understand is that this is a very common observation and they still give it a 9 or 10. This show deserves to be reflected accurately, and a 7.8 would make more sense than the current 8.8, given that nothing that is set up leads anywhere.The acting was good, the cinematography was good. But again the lack of delivery on set ups is just silly. There are two or three instances of set up, with small little resulting action from them, like a character dying. But then the major conflicts just die out. No attempts at giving action to em. So, again, it is misleading that this was given an 8.8.",7
"Oh Heck No!","I was so excited when I heard about this. I remembered adoring the 1980 version so much that it spurred me to read the novel.But oh my god. No, no, no, a thousands times no.Talk about unfaithful to the novel! $!?!RC was a great Blackthorne! CJ... not so much.The relationship between Mariko and Blackthorne, as written by Clavell - the engine that drives the novel and makes it great - is faithfully represented in the 1980s version but completely bastardized in this dreadful remake. I was heartbroken when Mariko died in the original version; I felt absolutely nothing this time around - which pretty much says it all.Last but not least... the 1980s version was filmed entirely in Japan. The remake? Filmed entirely in... British Columbia. #facepalm.",3
"If you don't like subtitles you're going to have a hard time with the plot","If you haven't read the novel or watched the 1980s Richard Chamberlain 1980 miniseries, you will come away with an amazing impression of feudal Japan at one of its most important points in history. But this isn't the Clavell version for both good and not so good reasons. This is a very japanese version with Anjin San as a lesser character, who while a spoiler and central figure, is shown as more mercenary and clueless, and frankly less likable and heroic as the book or Chamberlain versions. You are immersed in the palace intrigues and the interplay of each of the Japanese characters motivations and plotting. If you don't like subtitles this movie isn't for you since if you don't pay attention to the subtitles you will get rapidly lost in the complex plot. Of course there is English dialog (which funny enough is supposedly the characters speaking Portuguese and Dutch, as Portuguese is the common language with Mariko as translator, and no actual English is depicted spoken in the entire film). It would be funny if they do a Portuguese dub since this WOULD be the entirely accurate dialog.This is very much a movie about Japanese culture and politics with Anjin San thrown into deep water and unaware of the forces around him. The plot is a lot harder to follow because many important themes and details from the book (which were also in the 1980 version) were simply omitted and inadequate substitutions put in place which make some actions strangely inexplicable because these are reactions to events and circumstances which don't even exist in this version.If you've read the book then you will miss Vinck and the crew, and all the interplay with Anjin San's samurai, who are mentioned by Toranaga then only make an appearance at the end. Especially brother Michael (who as the alternate translator to Mariko and beholden to Anjin alone) who would have gone a long way to explain the slightly weird way Anjin has little grasp of Japanese then sporadically fluent then struggling again. Most of the importance of his ship, the Erasmus, is glossed over. In the book it is the threat of his potentially powerful ship let loose on the Portuguese black ship which is alluded to sporadically in this version, but with much less emphasis as a knife at the throat of the Portuguese.This is very much a movie about Japanese culture and politics with Anjin San thrown into deep water and unaware of the forces around him. The plot is a lot harder to follow because many important themes and details from the book (which were also in the 1980 version) were simply omitted and inadequate substitutions put in place which make some actions strangely inexplicable because these are reactions to events and circumstances which don't even exist in this version.",8
"Excellence!","As a person who grew up watching some of the best shows in the last 30 years such as The Sopranos, Entourage and Game of Thrones etc etc. Shogun is something of purity. No over the top bad guy, no need for some megastar power no character the Rock can play or funny guy Kevin hart. Not that I have anything against those talents it's just finally something true to give the book justice by creating a masterpiece on film. This show was well written, beautifully acted and executed to the highest of standards. Just watched the last episode and from what I've read is that there will be no season two. The show ended exactly how the book ended which will keeps us wanting more but I'm okay with that. Like Mariko-sama said ""We all live and die"" let the show be that way.",10
"A Modern Epic that Captivates and Exceeds Expectations","The 2024 adaptation of ""Shogun"" has exceeded expectations, offering a remarkable viewing experience that has captivated both myself and my wife.The series showcases an incredible leap in quality from its 1980s predecessor, thanks to its phenomenal casting, particularly Cosmo Jarvis and Hiroyuki Sanada, who have brought depth and authenticity to their roles. This adaptation, rich in action and intrigue, successfully modernizes the epic for today's audience, making it a standout series that has us eagerly awaiting each week's release.Its engaging storytelling and dynamic characters have made it the only series we commit to watching on a weekly basis, underscoring its exceptional impact.",10
"amazing directing it looks expensive","Watching the show feels like a movie every episode , the directing is good , it looks expensive on how the director made it... wnglish guy ok, but the rest they are good esp the head of edo togayama san , very good! Story is good.. everything is good i hope its a longer series.. but i enjoyed it every episode hope more tv series like this to come director is good an..very nice.. om just prolonging this since there is required characters to review anyway one hundred fifty more characters and im done. But seriously this is a gre a t well done tv series , as if made by a very big budget fil,m it looks and feel that way..",10
"Absolutely no rivals","First of all, it is simply a visual treat. The rivers of lights flow along the streets, and you start to see in them some spirits of Japanese mythology. The laconic sea landscape seems to be painted with calligraphic brush strokes. Not to mention the meticulous reconstruction of everyday details: painted screens, traditional gowns, lacquered armor. Not a single moment gets lost, even if the personages just thoughtfully contemplate the rain outside or engage in a ritual exchange of gifts.But all this is just a frame for something even more exquisite. The plot is crafted with unrivalled precision, and almost all dialogues show exceptional emotional weight. The scene where Anjin discloses important information which makes him a valuable ally creates more tension than any battle with a shower of arrows in a night forest. A sudden betrayal, an order to commit seppuku - all these things can strike more than The Red Wedding itself. It will be Crimson Sky.An artless, rough Englishmen, the navigator John Blackthorne, must now navigate the intricacies of relationships in so sophisticated Japanese society. He will undergo a deep cultural shock, a gradual understanding of the foreign mentality, and an existential identity crisis on his way to fully transforming into Anjin.However, you even need not be stranded in a foreign land to have an identity crisis. It is excellently illustrated by the story of Mariko, who is caught somewhere in between her tragic backstory, hate for her husband, loyalty to her lord, Catholic faith, and her slowly blossoming affection for a daring, audacious stranger. How her character is presented to the viewers is a right way to do the female empowerment. Mariko-sama can't defeat all her adversaries with a sword, but her skills as a gifted translator, her strong will and deep insight into human nature often make her more helpful than any man. She is definitely more compelling than most on-screen superheroines nowadays.Personages, plans and worldviews clash, a tight web of political intrigues, polite equivocations and social conventions is woven, and you get completely caught in it. It overwhelms you, drives you to the point that you think you can endure no more, but it gets more and more ghastly - and you can't help but watch. What remains is a heartfelt longing for an authentic connection across the boundaries of nations, countries, religious beliefs, ethnic groups and languages. As a result, when you get some touching moments as a reward, it is more cathartic than in a Greek tragedy. Not only can a gaijin win the heart of a Japanese beauty, but even a protestant and a catholic can have a friendly conversation, dreaming about a future in which all their controversies will no longer be such a big deal.Finally, there is him. Hiroyuki Sanada absolutely kills it with every concise, filigree remark in the role of ruthless, scheming and shrewd Toranaga. Of course, everyone who read about the history of Japan knows perfectly well that the story of Shogun is not quite historical. And also knows what became of the idyllic vision of a future without war under the rule of the Shogunate. A horrifying persecution of all Japanese Christians, a despotic regime, opposed to inventions and innovations, nearly total isolation from the Western world. But this is another story, to be discussed in connection with some other films, and can't tarnish appalling and stunning beauty of this otherworldly remake.",10
"Wow!","Do yourself a favour and watch this amazing show. I'm a big fan of GoT, House of The Dragon, Big Bang Theory, The Big Lebowski, Shawshank Redemption, Breaking Bad, most Quentin Tarantino movies, etc. Why are they relevant? They aren't, as such... It just perhaps explains the kind of things I like. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE EVER WATCHED ðGreat acting, particularly the actors that play Toranaga, Marico and Blackthorne. But honestly all of them. The story is riveting, based upon research of that period in feudal Japan. The cinematography, wonderful locations, but above all the drama. JUST WATCH IT.",10
"A Swan Song in a Time of Deafness","I remember seeing the trailer for this series a few months back and thought this is what I've been looking for; Japan in the late seventeenth century. The production is excellent and could easily be mistaken for a high budget film. The writing is sharp and even had quirk in it, fast paced and thought provoking. But what stood even beyond this is the characters. They actually feel real, imagine that in this time of famine, we have been starved of intelligent characters for so long, it felt refreshing to actually see writers put some effort into building these ""people"". Speaking of which, John Blackthorne the wild card British Pirate(Merchent - yeah right) that could upset the tides of war was a bold gamble on the writers behalf, but if they play there cards right, he might be the Ace that grants this series it's well deserved second season. If you haven't already, I would strongly recommend you start this series, you will not regret it.",9
"SHOGUN is completely Captivating, deeply Profound and even enlightening.","I waited until watching episode 4 to write a review and now I am most certain that the new 'Shogun' series is a deeply profound, completely captivating, meticulously authentic version of James Clavell's groundbreaking novel. The character portrayals of Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), Mariko (Anna Sawai), and Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis) are intricately complex and multi-dimensional. It is genuinely fascinating to watch the actors simply interact and converse within a room. I found myself re-watching specific conversations 3 or 4 times over to extract every nuance since much vital information is communicated thru subtle physical gestures and facial expressions, and usually not thru words alone, which has the effect of pulling the viewer deeply into this 16th Century Japanese environment since full concentration and attention to detail is most definitely required at all times while viewing! I can't remember the last time I have watched a series so intensively, and waited in such anticipation for each subsequent episode..... feeling as if being allowed to enter this mesmerizing 16th Century Japanese World for roughly 70 minutes each week!Much credit for this exceptionally well researched, well crafted, authentic Shogun series must go to writer-producer team Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks and a lot of the meticulous authenticity can also be attributed to Hiroyuki Sanada who has been a movie Star in both Japan and America for many years and has a wealth of experience starring in pivotal cinematic Samurai epics, he is also a producer and obviously has incredible knowledge of the subject matter presented here! Sanada's portrayal of Lord Toranaga as an exceedingly shrewd, astute, and masterful tactician seems spot-on.Anna Sawai also gives an amazing performance as Mariko, embodying the profound inner conflict due to her loyalty to Toranaga versus Mariko's sincere wish to be a devout Christian = this is a fascinating aspect creating much internal struggle which Sawai expertly expresses in very subtle but effective ways. An interesting note is that Anna Sawai mentioned in interviews that she thoroughly researched the life of 'Hosokawa Garasha' who lived an actual Life very similar to Mariko's in that same 16th Century Era of Japanese history and was a fascinating and complex person in real life.Cosmo Jarvis also gives an excellent portrayal of 'Blackthorne"" (who also had a real life counterpart in William Adams). Jarvis appears to be an expert 'method' actor and imbues Blackthorne with an extreme degree of disheveled bewilderment but also a keen pragmatic mind that adapts to situations very quickly and is able to appease and gain a littlle of Toranaga's trust early on by imparting key bits of information regarding the covert plans of the Portuguese.All in all I am really enjoying this new version of Shogun = all performances are beyond excellent and the overall presentation is often deeply profound and even elightening while still being amazingly entertaining! 10 Stars +",10
"An Epic Misadventure","There is plenty to like at first with the series. The authenticity to Japanese customs and language, the beautiful visuals in cinematography and dress, and the set up of different characters. The problem is as the show progresses, the characters do not. English subtitles are needed, not only for those who don't speak Japanese but those who butcher the English language. Perhaps their authenticity to speaking 16th century uneducated English was intended, but John Blackthorne, his sailors, and other sailors are difficult to understand throughout the series and often seem to yell their lines. The hope was John Blackthorne would grow and adapt, that he would learn the language, understand the customs, and love the people. He does not. As other reviews mentioned, he is close to a village idiot who just wants to leave as soon as possible even late into the series. Sure he falls for his beautiful Japanese translator, which does nothing but show how shallow of a man he is. He also learns to bathe which sadly is progress, but he continues to bumble his way through the show even at the end. He's very unlikable from start to finish. Mariko, his translator, and Usami, John's housekeeper, are the only likable characters both of which have such tragic lives that they want to be free of them by committing Seppuku. With so many samurai characters, the hope is there would be some epic fight scenes and battles but there wasn't much. The number of suicides is equal to the few fight scenes, which are short and glossed over. The show builds to a grand ending only for it to be undramatic due to great scheming. The show was full of unnecessary sex scenes that did nothing to add to the story. This show does not compare to The Last Samurai which is a pretty low bar in Samurai shows. The expectations of what is built early on fall flat by the end. If talking, scheming, no real action, no real love story, a complex plot that builds to nothing is your thing, than this is your show.",6
"Is this the most boring show of 2024","I was really looking forward to this new version of Clavell's book as I had enjoyed the Richard Chamberlain version all those years ago.The first 3 episodes I could see that the story was developing, albeit at a slow almost glacial pace, and was looking forward to something happening.However that pace I mentioned earlier slowed, if such a thing were possible, and I found myself getting bored, to the point where I was beginning to envy those cast members who managed to get out early by committing seppuku. I presume had that written in their contracts after reading the script.Nothing happened, literally nothing, we saw the same conversations, and whilst some high minded critics might refer to that being 'nuanced' anyone else looking to be entertained would call it repetitive.Suffice to say the series was a disappointment and how any reviewer on here can give it 10/10 is beyond me, when you compare it to the likes of the Sopranos or Breaking Bad.Simply mind boggling, or perhaps like me they started to doze off.Well I watched it to the end and it only worse, nothing of substance occurred. The lead actor may as well have not been present.Sayonara.",1
"Superlative reboot of the 80's Classic series and made for TV movie","This series a big draw for us old farts who read James clavell's novels
In the late 70's and 80's.I would imagine Richard Chamberlain is enjoying some new attention
In his salad days.The first two episodes 100%,with the next generation actors,supported by veteran Japanese artists,Hiroyuki Sanada my favourite and also in other dramas, a great mifune retread.Newcomers maybe shocked by the history
of European expansion and the opening of trade routes with the far east,it had already been divvied up by the Catholic kings of Spain and Portugal,who were determined to supplant the Japanese culture with their own doctrine, then along comes an Englishman,shipwrecked,and keen to establish the British empire existence, sworn trade enemy of the Portuguese.incidentally the Japanese considered the european invasion as pirates and barbarians.it would take almost two centuries before the isolationist policy would bring Japan into the modern world.Sorry for the potted history lesson,but you have to accept the stark brutality portrayed on screen by the indigenous towards foreign invaders,""The Gajinn,sic.foreign devils""
I hope this series continues with a more authentic rep of clavells's novels..Tai Pan is James clavell's next century thriller ,and would be a great follow up,if this repro is successful. So far so good.",10
"Shogun: A Masterpiece of Cultural Collision That Should End on a High Note","The 2023 mini-series Shogun, adapted from James Clavell's iconic novel, is an epic blend of complex storytelling, mesmerising performances, and breathtaking visuals. Over 10 episodes, the series remains gripping from start to finish, immersing viewers in a dramatic clash of cultures and political power struggles that never falters in intensity.At the heart of Shogun is the brilliant performance of Hiroyuki Sanada as Lord Toranaga. Sanada's portrayal of the ambitious and calculating daimyo is nothing short of masterful. Toranaga's quest for power and control over the shogunate drives much of the series, and Sanada perfectly embodies the character's sharp intellect, strategic mind, and ruthless determination. His performance anchors the show, capturing the complex layers of a leader who must balance personal desires with the demands of politics and loyalty. Toranaga is a character who always seems to be several steps ahead of everyone else, and Sanada plays him with the kind of gravitas and charisma that makes every scene with him captivating.Tadanobu Asano also delivers a memorable performance as Yabushige, a key figure in Toranaga's inner circle. While Yabushige's role in the series is significant, his motivations are ultimately more self-serving. Asano brings complexity to Yabushige making him a character you both like and mistrust. There is never a dull moment when he's on screen.Cosmo Jarvis, portraying John Blackthorne, brings great depth to the role of the English navigator caught in the midst of this world. Jarvis convincingly captures Blackthorne's evolution from a brash, out-of-place foreigner to a man who begins to understand and respect the complexities of Japanese society. His dynamic with Lord Toranaga and his growing admiration for Japanese culture, particularly through his relationship with Mariko, are pivotal to his character's development. Jarvis's portrayal is filled with emotional depth, making Blackthorne's journey both compelling and relatable.Honourable mentions must also go to Anna Sawai, whose portrayal of Mariko is one of the series' most emotionally charged performances. Mariko, a Christian convert and translator for Blackthorne, stands as the bridge between two worlds. Sawai expertly balances Mariko's loyalty to Toranaga, her religious convictions, and her growing affection for Blackthorne, all while maintaining her inner strength and poise. Her performance adds heart and complexity to the story, particularly in the way Mariko embodies the struggle between duty, faith, and personal desire.The writing in Shogun is one of its greatest strengths. The series does a remarkable job of adapting Clavell's dense and sprawling novel into a tightly woven narrative that flows effortlessly across the 10 episodes. The writers skillfully manage the political intrigue and cultural clash, keeping the tension high without losing the nuance of the characters' personal struggles. Every episode leaves the audience eager for the next, as the stakes rise and the characters' fates intertwine in increasingly complex ways.Visually, Shogun is a stunning achievement. The cinematography captures the beauty of Japan's landscapes, the intricacies of feudal architecture, and the stark contrast between the European and Japanese worlds. The series excels in creating an immersive world, where each frame is meticulously crafted to reflect the historical and cultural richness of the period. The visuals reinforce the clash between two civilizations-each viewing itself as the center of the world-and yet slowly learning from and adapting to each other.In conclusion, Shogun is a masterful adaptation, delivering a mesmerising blend of political intrigue, cultural exploration, and personal drama. The performances of Hiroyuki Sanada as the ambitious leader Toranaga, Cosmo Jarvis as the transformed Blackthorne, Anna Sawai as the conflicted Mariko, and Tadanobu Asano as the ambivalent Yabushige, are all standout elements that bring the story to life. Combined with exceptional writing and breathtaking cinematography, Shogun is a must-watch for fans of historical drama and anyone drawn to stories of cultural collision and human ambition.It is crucial to recognise that this story is complete as it stands. The mini-series was conceived as a single-season event, and its success should not lead to further extensions that could dilute its impact. Pursuing additional seasons for financial gain risks undermining the story's integrity and leaving it in a place where it no longer holds the same emotional and narrative weight. Shogun should remain a one-season masterpiece, celebrated for the brilliance it has achieved without overstaying its welcome. Let it stand as a singular, well-crafted chapter in television history, rather than a franchise stretched too thin.",10
"Terrific acting performances, eyedropping gorgeous photography and a visceral, mesmirising storyline. Near perfect epic drama!","This epic drama series starts out slow and unassuming, but this storyline gets more and more intense, slowly but steadily towards the riveting, visceral, intense and dramatic end. So have some patience at the start, your patience will be rewarded...The good: the actors (and characters) in this story are really impressive (unlike many other tv series) and even the supporting actors are good (which is a rarity), with great actor's chemistry between the leading actors. What incredible delight to watch!More good: this storyline is really intrigueing, although it starts out quite slow and unassuming, this story spirals into a feast of honor and survival, with the most wicked and dramatic and heroic plot turns that leaves me behind breathing for some relief...Even more good: this series looks and sounds the part. With beautiful costumes and sets and eyedropping gorgeous photography. What beauty.This is the sort of quality one only usually gets to see in masterfully made feature movie classics.Beware: you might be misled by the trailer, which shows lots of action sequences, but besides several stylish, yet quite bloody, short samourai fighting scenes, this movie is firstmost (for some 80%) an ACTOR's movie with TERRIFIC dialogues and lots of suspenseful INTRIGUES. Probably best suited for an audience who appreciates the finer period acting dramas is my (lucky) guess...One of the very few tv series that make me watch the end credits of EVERY episode till the very last credit line and the last piece of soundsore. What blissful mastery!Bravo!",8
"Unique.","A fantastic and engrossing show, and the stakes of how it begins were entirely unexpected. I was surprised by the overlap with the Protestant/Catholic divide per Spain, and Portugal as it correlated to the English and the time period tied together with this period in Japan.The pilot episode introduces a unique and interesting Englishman who quickly becomes a central character to the storyline and watching how he tries to connect when reaching Japan and being unable to bridge the gap of communication at first was both a brutal and intriguing watch.There are many layers of storyline happening at once and lots of detail specific scenes that capture various sentiments between different types of people as they are all brought into Japanese culture - or in some cases, exposed to Europeans and their empirical mindset. It's interesting to see two very different, and very technically advanced and civilized worlds meet and how their people respond during those interactions gives even more insight into the difficulties posed in life during these times, and across diverse viewpoints.",9
"Incredible","Shogun is one of the greatest shows of all time in my opinion. It is so much more than just what you see on the surface that makes it beautiful. Intricate details like the use of outdated Japanese are what really set this show apart. It is not what a lot of people expect I'm sure cause there is minimal action, but the story is so damn intriguing. It is more about telling a story of how the Japanese people lived during that time. It really captures a lot of things. How powerful faith is to people, and how many use it to control people and get rich off of it. How devoted the Japanese people were, and for the most part still are. Duty and honor above all things. It really is a beautiful thing. I love how Anjin was used as a vessel that kinda spoke for the audience in a way. Many of the things we would question, he questioned. On the outside we look into their culture and question many of the choices they make, because instead of making choices for themselves, many of the people that lived in that time in Japan made choices out of duty to their Lord without question. It really makes you think at the end of the day. I loved the little haikus and other things as well. It left me wanting so much more. I am sad to see it finished.",10
"Sheer perfection","This is as serious as a production can get. The attention to detail What a hero Hiroyuki Sanada is as the lead, consultant and producer of the show. It's 10+ years in the making. The costumes are meticulous but a feast for the eyes, the set is palatial but architecturally prominent, the action is necessary and pushing the drama to the high point. The acting is intense and thoughtful. All the great comments about representation is right, it's so well done. I've learnt a lot from this show about that section of Japanese history.This is Japanese perfection x Hollywood budget and resources. SO. MUCH. HEART.",10
"Very well done, almost perfect.","Having read the original book, and remembering the original TV miniseries, this has so far done a really credible job. Location are great stand ins, actors are doing an incredible job. It does not move overly fast and not to many confusing flash backs. However, just a few things keep it from the 10, I would love to get it. Unlike the original series the show is dark, not as bright in coloring if that makes sense. The other problem is the subtitles. While the teen in movies is to use native language with subtitle, having to read the almost all the time, distracts from being able to sit back and enjoy the film itself. If you lie having to read your shows, it's perfect.",8
"Fantastic in every way","People who have read the book who gave this a low rating are merely doing so out of spite. I get that it isn't exactly page for page the same as the book or the 80s series but that doesn't magically make this series bad. Even if you take into account the changes from the source material, it still is a great series. I wish that people could be more realistic with their own expectations and their feelings when something isn't exactly what they want yet is still masterfully done.Everything in this series is on point. There isn't a negative thing I can say about anything. Yes the story does extend on for a bit but there is a lot of nuance in the characters and their ambitions. I rich world like this one has to be delicately laid out and not just thrown together on a whim. Everything feels like it has a purpose in the filming. The colors, the set pieces, the costumes, everything. Everyone does a fantastic job in their characters and they bring real feelings and emotions out of them that are very tangible. I am pleased that this series has shown that there indeed are people out there who know how to make great film and artwork still. This series is as close to perfect as something can be.",10
"An epic journey, however a little anticlimactic","I know not everyone will agree with this opinion but I couldn't help but feel just a little disappointed by the ending of Shogun.There is no denying the satisfaction of seeing Toranaga's plan come full circle and how he truly was the master strategist behind everything that eventually led to his victory. All of those who played a key role.I think the main feeling of loss comes from not ever really seeing Torunaga in action. The whole season felt like it was building towards some kind of confrontation that never really happened or at least was shown. Now, please don't misunderstand. I am not asking for an epic battle or even filming of the war itself. But for there to be zero action or suspense in the finale seemed weird to me. We basically just got a narration of how things concluded instead of actually experiencing the conclusion for ourselves.What if they had taken an extra episode, covering that final month, to see how the tide turns and perhaps show some of the skirmishes leading to the eventual defeat of Ishido.I think I just really wanted to see Hiroyuki Sanada be a samurai again and be the shogun. He was amazing in his swordplay when he starred in The Last Samurai. I think I wanted to actually see him be Shogun and just never really got to experience that.Don't get me wrong, it was an excellent show through and through. I just wanted a little more sauce.",7
"Good watch, but also overrated","This is not as good as many make it out to be. Don't get me wrong, this is, for today, excellent TV, but claiming this is genius or the best show ever is laughable and sad. I get it, you have not seen anything okay on TV in a very long time so when something good comes along you think it is great, great becomes fantastic and so on. But slow down a bit.This has gorgeous cinematography. Japan has never looked more beautiful. The acting is, for the most part, the main highlight. There are a lot of slow moving pieces, a lot of build up (usually to nothing), and if it wasn't for the acting his would be boring. Several characters are great, and the general story very interesting.Sadly there also ends the positives.I am a big fan of the old mini-series which was excellent, and did the story much more justice. The acting on the older version was just as good. Yea, the cinematography was worse and they could not rely on CGi, but the directing, editing and pacing was much, much better.When I say that this has gorgeous cinematography, we are also shown that. Over, and over, and over again. Slow moving camera shoots, panoramic slow moving camera over a city, within a building, slow moving characters walk around, bow, sit down, bow, have tea, bow and then kill themselves slowly. I get it, it is beautiful, artsy, and it is great filmmaking, but not when you do it 100 times. Each episode can easily be cut down 10min and it will be much better for it.Another thing that really bothers me is that the antagonistic tone is much more modern in this version. Instead of showing good politics, intrigues, and diplomacy, we are instead shown antagonism. In the old version we got a slow build up of understanding, and the Portuguese, although mostly antagonists, are shown to be just as good and moral as everyone else. In this show, not so much.I think this is good, and if you have not read the book or seen the original TV show, you are likely to enjoy this a lot more than me. And this is, for today, great TV. But this is also badly edited, badly directed, slow paced, and despite the excellent acting even boring at times. A 5/10, and I do recommend, but I would suggest you go watch the older version instead. Much better TV.",5
"Stunning Authentic Series","A engaging, historic story that shows a clash of cultures with several stellar aspects of this series. Let me break down what's impressive with Shogun.The casting was superb with believable actors playing the parts.The historic accuracy of the Japanese culture with accurate depictions of the colonial era across Asia.The art direction made a powerful impact and helped immerse you in the story.The research for this series was impressive where minute detail were perfected to made an authentic story including ships and cultures.The Shogun series followed Clavell's book closely and added to the viewer's enjoyment.",10
"Modern excellence","From the first moment to the last, this show drags you in and makes you love its characters. That's what Shogun is in it's core, character driven narrative.It feels like a show written for writers. It's regular practice to put a sort of death mark on characters. If they nearly die, they eventually die. But with Mariko it felt like they were going to reverse that. She had wanted to die all show, and when she was about to do it she hesitated and was saved by Ishido. She was happy to have survived, showing major character growth. I thought they wouldn't go through with it. 30 mins later and damn I was wrong. They reversed the reverse. Well played.",10
"REVIEW IN PROGRESS","EPISODE 01 - ANJIN:""Shogun"" dives headfirst into feudal Japan in its premiere episode, ""Anjin."" Lush visuals and intricate costumes transport viewers to 1600, while the story unfolds through the eyes of both a powerful warlord and a shipwrecked English pilot.The episode masterfully establishes the complex power dynamics and cultural clashes at play. Lord Toranaga navigates political intrigue, while John Blackthorne, an outsider, struggles to adapt to Japanese customs.While the pacing might be slow for some, the deliberate approach allows for nuanced character development. The episode doesn't shy away from portraying the realities of the time, and a thought-provoking closing monologue challenges viewers' perspectives. ""Anjin"" sets the stage for an epic journey with its captivating story, stunning visuals, and intricate writing.9.05/10.EPISODE 2 - SERVANTS OF TWO MASTERSWhile not quite reaching the heights of the premiere, ""Shogun's"" second episode, ""Servants of Two Masters,"" continues to build the complex world and political intrigue of feudal Japan.The episode focuses heavily on exposition, laying out the motivations and alliances of various characters. While this can feel clunky at times, with characters delivering lengthy explanations, it ultimately provides a deeper understanding of the power struggles at play.One of the episode's highlights is the revelation of the Portuguese Jesuits' influence. Their control over trade and their willingness to manipulate for personal gain adds a layer of complexity to the political landscape.We also see the first signs of John Blackthorne becoming more than just a pawn. His knowledge about the Portuguese and their secret gun-running base proves valuable to Lord Toranaga.The episode isn't without its flaws. The pacing feels slow at times, and some of the dialogue comes across as overly explanatory. However, the episode is saved by strong performances, particularly from Tadanobu Asano, who steals the show as the cunning and conflicted Yabushige.Overall, ""Servants of Two Masters"" is a solid, albeit slightly uneven, episode that builds upon the foundation laid in the premiere. It leaves viewers eager to see how the various factions will clash and how Blackthorne will find his place in this intricate web of power and intrigue.8.975/10.",9
"FANDEMICALLY REVIEW'd","I have thought that this looked interesting ever since it was announced. I admit I have never seen the original show. I was not prepared for how great this show was/is. This show is so good, I don't even want to spoil it for you. The character introduction is solid. You care for the ones you should, and hate the ones that you're supposed to. The action is believable. I was thinking is was just going to be an action martial arts show, and it definitely is not that! The entire show feels like a poem that speaks to your heart from a time that honor & trust was the way of the warrior. I beg of you to watch this show. This show has something for everyone that watches it. If I have to give some type of critique, I would say that some of the subtitles were gone before I could read them fully. I think my brain was just soaking up the beautiful cinematography. FX great job on this one!",10
"~ a flower's only a flower because it falls ~","My personal mini series Mount Rushmore is led by Band Of Brothers and Chernobyl. Two amazing HBO historical series that left a deep impact on my view of TV. But similar to Vinland Saga, Shogun is able to take histories and intertwine them in this dramatic fashion by taking liberties with its story and blending history and drama in a great way.Shogun is framed as this show that indicates battle as swords and battle armor are the forefront of the shows poster. Even the synopsis of the show indicates taking action on enemies and staying a float in an ongoing civil war. And while there certainly is a war, it's not as simple as any ordinary one. Characters in Shogun have to be careful with their actions as the events of the show are to slowly let someone bleed out rather than to charge them head on and leave body's dropping.This series is a long chess game that gives every move room to breathe, leaving characters to ponder and the audience to anticipate what's next throughout many unforeseen twists and turns. But some of the best elements of Shogun are some of the themes it portrays.Mariko is in my eyes Shogun's best character. Her backstory leaves a lifeless shadow on her despite the fact that she shows ambition in her path of following Lord Toranaga. But throughout the journey they're more glimpses of Mariko's past that make her motivations more clear. Throughout the show there are many quotes and poems regarding life, death, and other facets of the world the characters live in. The line that defined the series was one about a flower, and it perfectly encapsulates not only an arc, but the surrounding of that arc that put everything into perspective.When it comes to expectations, don't let the expectations of flashy battle weigh over you while watching this show because I think the intention is to show audiences that battles aren't as clear cut as drawing blades. It shows the impact of life and death by throwing you into a story where it doesn't take entire armies falling to determine the fate of many people, and sometimes it takes the right voice and message to make everything grow.Even though I think the Emmy's have lost an extreme amount of credibility from the way they treated shows like Better Call Saul and The Wire, I still appreciate the publicity and flowers it gives away to shows that end up translating to mainstream media since the Emmy's are the benchmark for TV awards. And with that hopefully Shogun sweeps the drama category as it's truly the best show of the year so far and is looking to stay that way. Not to mention Anna Sawai stealing the show as well Hiroyuki Sanada who acted AND produced this series. Either way, some award doesn't define what a great piece of media is. With or without one, Shogun is an accomplishment that should be cherished by anyone who enjoys the journey it takes you on.",9
"Shogun is the next GOT!!","You want political intrigue?! â
You want violence? â
You want Romance?! â

You want a great soundtrack â
I LOVED the first 2 episodes!! Yup some the bills up may take a bit.. however it's vital to know who these characters are.. why they operate the way they do and how they interact with each other (rivals family or allies)!!Hiroyuko Sanada (Mortal Kombat 2021, Last Samurai) is an amazing actor...but in this case he was also a producer BTS!! I can see him receiving an Emmy either as actor or producer!!I do wish they had used to actual Portuguese the non Asian characters used.. but we have to appeal to the American masses some way!!The costumes (as what I've read and seen bts of) are VERY authentic and great detail has been taken to make it appear so!The script is amazing and delivered by the actors in a believable thoughtful creative way that lets the actors shine!!I thoroughly enjoyed this series and I can't WAIT for the rest of it to come out..I do hope they are able to renew it for at LEAST 2 more seasons!! There's plenty to explore and expound on!!",10
"Slow Start to Episode 1 But Picks Up Steam from There","I almost gave up on this show about halfway through the first episode. I actually turned it off and started rewatching Game of Thrones on HBO Max. But tonight I decided to give it another shot and I am really glad that I did. The second half of episode 1 and all of episode 2 were really quite good. Now I am hooked and looking forward to seeing what's next.I don't mind having to read subtitles for a portion of each episode, and I certainly couldn't care less about whether the Portuguese explorers and the Catholics from centuries ago are portrayed as the bad guys (at least so far).Good character development and developing plot lines seem to be setting up for an interesting path forward. Despite what other people have said about this series, there has not been any nudity or sex scenes through the first two episodes.Worth a watch for sure.",8
"Immersive","I never got bored while watching episodes of the series. The characters are very well written. It was also a series that introduced me to Japan. It was very interesting that they did not attach importance to life and had a different perspective on the world. It was very enjoyable to watch Anjin's cultural clashes and the games of Toranaga Sama. I wish there was a second season. Mariko and Anjin's relationship was one of the things I liked about the series. But I couldn't help but feel sorry for Mariko's husband. Overall, it was a series that I liked very much and I recommend everyone to watch it.",9
"Good Enough","What I like most is the cast, the acting, and the production. Especially the Japanese actors shine in their roles (I had some difficulties with the characterization of the ""new"" Blackthorne). The story is, of course, well-known - if you have read the original book by James Clavell or watched the first adaptation for TV starring Richard Chamberlain. Additionally, if you know ""The Last Samurai"" with Tom Cruise, you will recognize many similarities. Regardless, Shogun is legitimate and a solid, well-made piece, good enough to kill some spare time. Conclusion: a good show, but it's definitely not the masterpiece that many other reviewers claim it to be. At least, that's my opinion.",7
"Terrivle","I had the opportunity to enjoy Shogun after reading the books. I was fascinated and totally captivated by the quality of acting, cinematography, plot development and all that came with the production of this masterpiece.My wife and I and the entire circle close to us were looking forward to this remake with all the technological advances in cinematography, the rich tradition of the original series, and superb acting that we knew was to come with this remake. Boy were we wrong. From the moment the first episode began, we knew that this was not going to be a good experience. 8.7 stars? Pleeeaasse! I'd give an 8.7, negative 8.7.",1
"Beautiful reboot","I was already a fan of the first series back in the 80s and they finally did made it true to the massive book from James Clavell. The book is yet a small part of the quadrilogy about Japan that the writer did. James Clavell spent a long time in Japan and the description and knowledge of the Middle Ages there is striking.What I really liked was the fact they we finally see more of the Japanese system of domos and the ultimate seat the Shogun. The Japanese actors shine. What a joy to see Hiroyushi Sanada again. I loved him in the Last Samurai and a joy to see. I really look forward to see the rest of the episodes. 3 so far. It's hard to wait !",9
"It's just amazing from start to finish.","I can already tell this show is amazing. Feudal Japan was one of the most violent times in Japan's history and the series emphasizes that fact throughout.The complex Japanese politics and psychology is the centerpiece. It shows a consistent inability to trust strangers yet they are at the greatest danger from the strangers they accepted.I really like how this show is rich with good acting, writing, directing, cinematography, and story. There is so much attention to detail.If you like the political dramas with a brutality on another level this show is for you. It's just amazing from start to finish.",10
"The best limited series on this genre! I would definitely recommend it to watch.","A great amalgamation of History, Art, Fashion, Religion and Savagery ""Shogun"" is a treat for the eyes. It is really not east to portray 1600s Japan of this magnitude in a series. Great job done by the production set team. Every cast has done a tremendous job in portraying their role. Hiroyuki Sanada , Anna Sawai, Jarvis and all others were at their best.Although, with a limitation of being a limited series the ending was a bit dull for me but at the same time every character's meets his/her fate.In my view, a limited series did not do justice on the book by James Clavell. It surely needed a series portraying the complete story. But hey, this was far better than my expectations.",9
"Excellent....costumes , Action Amazing actors except..","I can barely watch the lead Englishman ... His contacts made him look so strange. Like a goblin. Or a Cyclopes with two eyes. I watched 4 episodes ; production value is off the chain ! Costumes are magnificent... makeup is great ( except cyclopse eyes ) arrrrghhhhh I just can't get past those eyes or his acting ability. Im sorry. But I do work in the film industry... And I believe if they needed a blue eyed actor .... There are MANY who could have nailed the role.That being over said ; I probably watch the series a bit more but I'll fast forward past fake blue eyes. I cannot imagine a love scene with the beautiful Japanese lady and that guy.",10
"Excellent","This is one of the best TV shows I have ever seen.I'm tired of consumer series, which I watch, but mostly I sit on the phone or even fall asleep on them.I loved it so much that I put off watching a new episode, just to prolong the viewing process as much as possible.You can see the investment in it, everything is close to perfection, from the historical episodes, to the clothes, hairstyles, gestures, habits, it's extraordinary!Unfortunately, we Europeans are not used to unpleasant endings or the loss of beloved characters, this really took me out of my comfort zone.The love between Anjin and Mariko is truly a story that makes you reflect on many things.It deserved 10+.",10
"Spectacular and intriguing, but read the book!","My thoughts from the first two episodes:
This is a lavish production that's well worth seeing. But I strongly recommend reading the book and watching the original 1980 series. The casting for Father Sebastian, Father Alvito, Father Dell'Aqua and Captain Ferreira was better in the 1980 series. The current Rodrigues is well cast, but can't compare to John Rhys-Davies. Blackthorn is good but I notice his voice often sounds like Richard Burton ð The current version sort of glosses over the true depth of Yabu's perversion. I expect the current version will have more more time to be faithful to the novel since it is expected to over 10 hours compared to the original's 9 hours, but I wonder how many more plot changes we will see in coming episodes, e.g., the Captain General of the Erasmus didn't commit suicide, he died ashore of his illness; the tempest in which the galley taking Blackthorn to Osaka is virutally eliminated and the rescue of Rodriguez is overly simplified which is a shame since it is so central to the development of their friendship. Blackthorn's time in prison is also glossed over, again unfortunate since that is when he learns so much about the culture and language from the Friar. But, 8 more episodes to come. It will be an interesting ride :)",8
"The movie is damn good!!","The movie is damn good!!!The dialogues are written superbly, preventing the viewer from getting tired of listening to the dialogues!!!The photographs are magnificent, the editing is balanced!!The fight choreography is lame in places, but this is a very minor thing!!!The movie is damn good!!!The dialogues are written superbly, preventing the viewer from getting tired of listening to the dialogues!!!The photographs are magnificent, the editing is balanced!!The fight choreography is lame in places, but this is a very minor thing!!!The movie is damn good!!!The dialogues are written superbly, preventing the viewer from getting tired of listening to the dialogues!!!The photographs are magnificent, the editing is balanced!!The fight choreography is lame in places, but this is a very minor thing!!!",10
"Well Done","This is a well done series. The actors are all very good and they all give great performances. The backdrops and scenery are fantastic. I read the book about the same time the original mini series aired. The only down side for me is this one feels a little flat. They've given it a more realistic voice for modern times, but the fire is gone. I kind of miss the old school bombastic Japanize lord. Whether the original series seems more appropriate or not probably depends on your age. I think every generation is more biased against the newer versions. Definitely worth a watch in any case. Will. Looking forward to Gai-jin .",9
"They Didn't Read the Novel","Unfortunately, it appears as if the directors, producers, and writers did not...or must not have...read the novel. It was a very long time ago that I read Shogun...and perhaps a bit less time...that I watched the TV mini series (in the 80's, I believe). The novel and the TV mini series were excellent in every way. This 2024 version is not at all up to those standards. It's harsh and mean and without any of the class of the first mini series. There are some good performances, especially the person who plays Toranaga, but they are too few. The lead character, Pilot or Anjin, is aweful. He mopes around like a hulking monster. There are no redeeming qualities with this lead...as opposed to the novel and mini series. The dialogue is dyslexic and the plot is tiresome. Wish I could finish this version but I can't...it lacks style, it's too mean, and it's just plain dull.",3
"film students only?","Perhaps only IMDb members of a certain age will recall, but the 1980 version was also a major hit and swept the awards at the time. In fact, both versions are excellent. But the gauntlet is thrown to the film classes to deconstruct the differences. I have just watched both versions, top to bottom, and I was struck by the fact that the creators of this revised version somehow felt the original was too subtle for modern audiences -- many scenes of Japanese dialog, with no translation, and very long silent reaction shots -- and went out of their way to punch up the action scenes here instead. Do I agree with this upgrade? Yes and no. One of the powerful themes of the original novel was the clash of civilizations. Japan had a culture which, left on its own for centuries, placed great emphasis on strength, character and duty. The author of the novel was showing us that, under the right circumstances, a ""barbarian"" from our world could in fact rise to the occasion. It was a powerful message and, by scrutinizing both approaches very carefully, you can see that Chamberlain was better suited to the role. I would argue that both versions have their merits, but the earlier version has the greater depth and subtlety. The only major improvement, to this reviewer, was the casting of Anna Sawai in the modern version, who, to be fair, rates much higher on the Scoville scale. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer."" Please check out my list ""167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))",9
"Damn good so far","For those upset that actual Portuguese isn't being spoken, you do realize that the entire show would be subtitled without turning Portuguese into English? Aside from when the main character is talking to himself it would be Subtitled Japanese and subtitled Portuguese and the show would not get nearly the same viewership and then sadly canceled. Having the English and Portuguese speak English helps keep the flow of each episode moving at a smooth pace.With that out of the way, great show so far, the main character is a little off with his performance from time to time but everybody else knocks it out of the park. Excited to see what the rest of the season gives us.Ps: those who ""read the book"" and are all Butthurt, just stop. Not just with this show, all adaptations. They can't do everything in the book, be happy you're getting quality content for the things you love, there are plenty of fans of other books who get terrible, poorly cast, cheap movie and television adaptions from people who have no idea what they're doing, The dark tower, Twilight, the hobbit etc. Be thankful for what you get.",9
"Dramatic Accuracy Meets Intense Empathy - Season 1 Review","The c.1600s Feudal Japan era and its tradition-driven society were superbly showcased in season 1 of ""Shogun"". From outstanding Samurai action-choreo to some of the finest on-screen characterisations, this series delivered it all, and then some.It bottled vice and violence, but within the parameters of this historical tale. Such balance was exemplary and made the plot feel credible, though it was partly fiction.Partly, because season 1 of ""Shogun"" was based on the historical fiction after the same name by James Clavell. His novel was directly based on power struggles in Feudal Japan, with a special emphasis on Toyotomi Hideyoshi's successors, who later founded the Tokugawa shogunate.In the book as well as the series, each main character was based on an actual historical figure, dramatized as and where needed to tell this story.Hiroyuki Sanada (as Lord Yoshii Toranaga) deserves first mention before I delve further into this review. His timeless acting and extraordinary screen presence made his character stand out and leave a lasting impression.Anna Sawai (as Toda Mariko) brought subtlety, elegance, and deadly nuance to bear on her role in ""Shogun"" season 1. Every scene in which she featured felt rife with suspense and imminent danger. She also stoked outstanding empathy in the later episodes.Cosmo Jarvis (as John Blackthorne) was the 'foreigner' who, ever since he was brought to the Land of the Rising Sun, found his luck setting into darkness. His performance as an enterprising English Protestant was amazing, especially the way he conveyed the culture-shock gravitas of his situation. Blackthorne's gradual evolutionary arc was worth beholding.Tadanobu Asano (as Kashigi Yabushige) played a suspenseful double game that made him a red herring, of sorts. He also gave nothing away in almost all his scenes - an acting style that's quite underrated.Fumi Nikaido (as Ochiba No Kata) was subtle yet brilliant, delivering a performance that elevated statecraft and legacy-driven ambition. She was the mother of the Heir, the rightful Taiko who was yet young, leaving a power vacuum the Regents shamelessly exploited.The first season of ""Shogun"" covered Osaka, particularly the political turmoil brewing in the higher, and highest, ranks of government following the death of the former Taiko. I never would've guessed bureaucracy would be so intriguing.The detailed web that linked so many people - including Hiroyuki's Lord Toranaga and the intimidating Ishido Kazunari (played by Takehiro Hira), Lord Kiyama (played by Hiromoto Ida), Lord Sugiyama (played by Toshi Toda), and Lord Ohno (played by Takeshi Kurokawa) - was astounding.I liked how they captured the darker side of Portuguese-Catholic trade relations and corruptions instead of simply aggrandizing inter-nation prosperity angles. When they added some catalytic European Protestantism to the mix, I had a feeling some serious religio-political chaos would ensue; and it did.This Japanese period-drama showcased storytelling excellence in more ways than one. It could've easily broken the golden rule of 'show, don't tell' but managed to elevate the delivery of each episode - and the characters and struggles featured in them - in some of the most artistic and technical ways.Form whichever angle you approach it, this plot is not exactly something you'd call original. There are so many such Samurai stories, after all. The era in focus has been done to death, too, capturing the many slices and chapters in the lives of Shoguns and their fiefdoms.Regardless, ""Shogun"" season 1 somehow took the familiar and made it seem fresh and exciting. I remember feeling much the same when I watched ""Vikings"" (2013-2020). Yet, I was left in multiple states of suspense and longing when viewing ""Shogun"".Outwitting manoeuvres, assassination attempts, racial prejudices, and realistic twists added to the credibility of ""Shogun"" season 1.The way each player pursued their motives was human, down to a T. In fact, the protagonists who seemed to be the good guys only did what they did to hold on to what they had.This intensely empathic and exceptionally dramatized story has the power to stand the test of time. I can't wait to see what they've got lined up for us in season 2 of ""Shogun"".",9
"Glued to Your Screen Action","I have been waiting for a TV show to have the same grip on me that Game of Thrones had, I feel like it was the last show where every episode had me on the edge of me seat and holding my breath until the very enter - while at the same time completely amazed by the cinematography. Shogun delivers that experience, with the added benefit of being based in reality. The political atmosphere of feudal Japan is display with brutal accuracy, and the story of European colonialism in the East is re-set from the lens of the colonized. The show does well to represent the Japanese as the advanced society that the were and are, and not as the uncivilized societies past media has portrayed them as.",10
"""Brutally Beautiful Transcendental Experience""","It's been a long time since I've watched a show this meticulous, refreshing and drop-dead gorgeous. Its epic scale in the present day can only be closely compared to The Game of Thrones.The Cinematography and Photography *****

Language and Subtitling *****
The Storytelling and Pacing ****Leaving just a small margin for pacing (personal opinion) I truly believe this show is damn near perfect. It is such a visual treat!Anna Sawai as Lady Mariko embodies strength, perseverance and grace. Her character truly portrays the struggle of a woman held in by the constraints of the 17th-century traditionalist world dominated by men.One of my favourite actors, Hiroyuki Sanada (who also serves as Executive Producer on the show) is a stunner. He portrays the shrewd, strategic and charismatic Lord Torunaga effortlessly.Shout out to Tadanobu Asano who plays Kashigi Yabushige.The deliberate choice to stick to Japanese as the primary language was spot on. The use of historically accurate behaviour, production settings and finer details in costumes, including the extras is a testament to the endless research and collaboration for this show. The use of both Hollywood actors and seasoned Japanese actors from the homeland contributed to the authenticity. 'Noh' was also included within the storytelling - Noh is a Japanese form of theatre, seamlessly incorporated into the show to pay homage to this vibrant mystical culture. Not forgetting that a show of this scale commands a big investment. And I think it was worth it!Without giving more away, if you're not watching this show, you are definitely missing out!!!Thank you FX!",9
"Well played","Deceit, cunning and Everything that makes him a complete Lord, this should be a Bible of some sort indirect but at the same time direct in a vague manner, toranaga dono always keeping you in suspence not knowing what comes next is absolutely amazing and devastating in the of the unknown, this series taught me a valuable lesson of some sort that in life you yourself is all that matters, the imprint of one's name and legacy on the world is all that counts, the ambition to be the king it only counts when you see everything and everyone around you as an instrument for your ascension to the top, I've seen so many variations of power been display before cliche, in this case he already has a head start being born of high blood the cunning and deceit were just a gift from the gods and behold those talents weren't wasted on him, best series so far just another boom bang series that explodes till the end.",9
"Who picked the main character?","The main character Blackthorne looks like a low IQ dolt. I can't stand his limp cry baby facial expressions, but for the rest, the series is eminently watchable. Still, the original with legendary actor Richard Chamberlain was much better. Overall one say the Japanese cast performed better than the Europeans. One of the series' greatest strengths is its exploration of cultural differences and the clash of civilizations between East and West. Through the eyes of Blackthorne, viewers gain insight into the intricacies of Japanese society, from its strict hierarchical structure to its emphasis on honor and duty. This cultural exchange serves as a powerful lens through which to examine universal themes of identity, loyalty, and human nature.",8
"Is the world not ready for subtitles?","In the Treaty of Tordesillas Portugal and Spain divided the world in two. 530 years later this show did exactly the same... People from Japan speak japanese, people from England speak english, people from Portugal speak english and people from Spain, with no suprise at all, also speak english. For a series where authenticity is extremely important for it to work, I thought the world's audiences would be ready by now for subtitles... They even went further and cast Portuguese and Spanish actors just for them to speak english as ""portuguese"". I find myself in a time where I find it more annoying to portrait several languages in english than having a multi-language production.",6
"After seen it twice, didn't get the storyline.","I've seen the series twice, but even then I didn't get the storyline. The only thing what was in the frontline is a lot of slaughtering with grotesque scenes. The acting performance of the actors is good, but this is the only positive thing about this series. It's full of movie making mistakes, wrong lenses, sun cap borders, the overal is way to dark, even to watch on a OLED TV. It only shows a possibly dark age of the Japanese time, way to difficult to follow because of the many flashbacks, parallel storylines. I find it a waste of my 20 hour time to watch it twice, although the CGI was pretty good, with the ending like this I'm hoping they don't make a sequel.",2
"Best show since GOT.","Very good start to this show. Most people hate reading subtitles. But to me, I'd rather have an authentic show with the characters speaking their native tongue. So which is why I couldn't give it a better score because the Spanish are speaking English. The story is great, It gives a game of thrones type of vibe. 5 families running Japan but there is always that 1 family above em all that doesn't want to be on top but it is their destiny. Not to mention the main character is English. His mission is to discover Japan which he heard stories about the Spaniards discovering Japan and keeping the country a secret from the rest of the world in a time where Spain and Europe are at war.",9
"At last, a real vision of James Clavell's masterpiece","This is just stuning. A have now seen three episodes. I will admit a little niggle when Anjin escaped from the captain of the Black Ship, but it was a minor detail I won't reveal here as I don't want to write a spoiler. Finally we have some real stars coming from Japan, always a country I felt had the vision but was up against Hollywood.Hiroyuki Sanada is magnificent as Yoshii Toranaga, and good to see him and Tadanobu Asano playing Kashigi Yabushige redeemed after that awful 47 Ronin.I really liked Hiroyuki Sanada as Takeshi Nagase in 'The Railway Man'. He really is the male actor to bridge East and West movies and let's not forget how good he was in 'The Last Samurai'.Anna Sawai as Toda Mariko is just breathtakingly beautiful, but she also plays the part to perfection. Mildy hostile to John Blackthorn (Anjin) but also drawn to his honest view of the world beyond Japan.This is just a magnificent series that I really cannot wait to progress. If I could give it more than 10 stars, I would.",10
"Must watch","This show is amazing. Great cast backed with high budget. Almost like Game of Thrones.Great story that will have your emotions tested. They really took pointers from George R. R. Martin, when getting attached to characters.I have not watched a show of this quality of acting, screenwriting, or producing since Game of Thrones.At first I was upset about it being mostly in Japanese and had to read the subtitles. DO NOT let that discourge you, it actually gives the series more flavor and made it more authentic.Every episode was great, and kept me wanting more. Now, I can't wait for season 2.Nevertheless, this is a must watch series.P. S
Pay attention when watching, or you will miss out a lot.",10
"It is utterly unmissable","""Shogun"" (2024) emerges as a cinematic tour de force, embedding itself within the rich tapestry of historical drama while delivering an enthralling and nuanced portrayal of feudal Japan. Reimagining James Clavell's seminal novel, this adaptation doesn't merely retell the story-it redefines it, breathing fresh life into the pages with its exceptional storytelling and visual mastery.The film offers a heady blend of political intrigue, character complexity, and cultural exchange, set against the stunning backdrop of 16th-century Japan-one that's rendered with painstaking detail. Every frame is a visual feast, reflecting careful research and a commitment to authenticity. The use of traditional Japanese music and instruments adds an additional layer of immersion, grounding the narrative in its time and place.At the heart of ""Shogun"" is an ensemble cast whose performances are nothing short of remarkable. The lead actors navigate the linguistic and emotional hurdles of their characters with aplomb, creating a powerful dynamic that drives the film's central relationships. The chemistry is palpable, the emotional stakes are high, and the character arcs are deftly crafted, making the historical figures they portray feel incredibly real and human.What distinguishes this adaptation is its respectful approach to cultural representation. The filmmakers handle the cultural exchange with sensitivity and insight, avoiding the pitfalls of orientalism that often plague Western portrayals of Japan. The script-the product of a diverse and well-versed writing team-delicately balances the perspectives of its characters, fostering empathy without sacrificing the complexity of the era's geopolitical landscape.""Shogun"" is a rare gem that not only entertains but also educates, challenging its audience to contemplate the nature of power, honor, and the human spirit. It's a narrative that defies expectations, transcends its genre, and invites viewers to consider the past in the light of the present. As a piece of historical fiction, it sets a new standard, and as a cinematic experience, it is utterly unmissable. 10/10.",10
"Japan as it where","This historical drama is well made. I dont know if the budget is big but the production is very serious and has done a very precise depiction of the japaneese culture and customs at that time. What stands out the most to me is the cultural behaviour of that time that is very distinct and rigorous. Its actually at par with the story as the highpoint of this series.The acting is fenomenal. Everyone does an amazing job and its a real treat to watch the actors act out the japaneese culture.Camera and sound is hardly noticeable because the timing of everything is so good that you are so into what you watch that you dont notice the music.The diversity aspect have been heavily cut down, thankfully.. but they couldnt leave it all alone. The main character, the anjin(englishman) is half armenian, half english, but thats pretty much it. I guess the diversity aspect only have to apply to White peoples productions..The story is allright but kinda slow and not the series strong part and also why I gave this 8/10â­ and not 9.I recommend this but beware of the slow tempo.",8
"very intriguing","It took me a minute to get into the story and understand what's happening. It's like culture shock being immediately immersed in traditional Japanese culture, which can be brutal and unforgiving at times. It sets the perfect stage from the perspective of a visitor arriving in Japan for the first time, learning the language, figuring out the strict social hierchy and trying to survive such a harsh environment. In my opinion the world building was really great and I was addicted by the ended of the first episode, I don't want to ruin it but the last scene was intense. Its like a mic drop but with cameras.",10
"This show is amazing","Everything about it from costumes to makeup to the acting and writing is beautiful. You can tell a lot of money when into this. I loved the original series and this one is better.I read the book and this series definitely does it justice and is visually so incredible. The whole cast is really good and the sets are lovely to look at. It's also very historically accurate.its cool to see Japanese actors being represented on the screen too. I will admit that the acting of Cosmo Jarvis is over the top and that's the only thing that stops me from giving this a full ten out of ten review. I really recommend this show.",9
"Not as good as it thinks it is.","I much preferred the original with Richard Chamberlain to be honest. This is ok good acting, looks grand with CGI but the script and dialog just seems out of place. Some of the way the Japanese speak sounds to American. Especially for the 16th Century. They have drawn it out over 10 hour long episodes. We don't really get a conclusion and now the second series is on the way. To long to slow, anti climatic and unbeliable. The way the were pulling the sunken ship from the sea was just ridiculous to be honest. The lead of Blackthorn is a good actor but seems to melodramatic in this, like he is on stage on a lavish production projecting out to an theater. The swearing was uncalled for and like I said it all seems to modern in its way of speaking. Don't think I will bother with series two, will rewatch the original.",4
"One of the all time greats","This incredible drama series, based on the ever acclaimed novel, that I have read - quicklg ascended as one of the all time great historical epics, rivaling others such as Game of Thrones and Rome, and for good reason.The actors all do an incredible job, conveing s complex, emotional and vastly ranged set of characters, all true to the novel and then some. Very career defining, very beautiful, and accompined by a stellar ever encompassing script for the ages. Splendidly written and paced.The cinematography, cutting and editing is stellar, as ever very feature worthy, and immensely beautifully put together. Great action set pieces, and some overall beautifully looking scenery and imagery. Very beautifully put together.Overall, definitely a masterful achievement, that is highly recommended for any lover of film!",10
"9.8/10 show. Better than the original.","No spoilers, just my personal view.Firstly I would like to say that 99.9% of the time, any remade tv shows and films I hate, as the writers or directors fail in improving the story and just cash grab with unoriginal or weak ideas. However, this updated version of Shogun has surpassed the 1980's mini series, which is also a great watch that I would rate 9.5.The first credit must go to the superb screenplay writing skills of all the writers involved. Well done, and I hope you have great careers ahead of you. The second credit would be to the director. Great job indeed.FX Productions spared no expense with amazing visuals and compling a great team to work on the show.The cast couldn't have been any better. The actors were on point from the main, all the way down to the little guys. These talented people really helped immerse the watcher.The plot was well received and it was different to the 1980's version. The twists and turns in the new show are very up to date for what's expected in this day and age.Overall, I would recommend this show as - A must watch.Well done to everyone involved, you made a great tv show that I will re-watch in the future.",10
"Why?","I can't find fault with the first two episodes of this new adaptation of James Clavell's brilliant novel. The cast is fine, the sets and scenery look perfect, and the production values are the highest.My only question is: Why? Why remake a story that was already done brilliantly in 1980 and which still holds up well on dvd, when there is so much classic Japanese literature that would lend itself to film or tv adaptation and would add new themes, stories and characters to the genre?This remake, while excellent, seems to be another example of Hollywood's creative constipation and propensity for taking shortcuts to maximize profits rather than adding to the choices that they give us. I'll watch the rest of the series and undoubtedly enjoy it, but instead of waiting for each new episode, it's far more easier to watch my dvd version of the 1980 version on my own schedule.",10
"Wow wow wow","One of the best series I've seen in a while.Great story, good acting and very exciting.It really pulls you in. Don't even try to speak to me while I'm watching this show you might just be banned to your room.Using the original language with subtitles is brilliant, it keeps the story so authentic. The sets and costumes are beautiful and speaks to the period which makes it even more realistic.There has been no part so far after 4 episodes that I felt the need to fast forward because it was boring.This show deserves a 10 and more. Waiting in anticipation for the next episode or episodes if you will.",10
"Superbly Done","This is a top quality production that is one of the finest series to hit our screens over the last 12 months. It's based on the bestselling 1975 novel by James Clavell, as was the earlier 1980 miniseries starring Richard Chamberlain, and it takes us to early 17th century Japan in the company of the fictional English sailor John Blackthorne. There's real substance to the piece and we feel immersed in that era. The tale is told with great flair and a strong intellect and at times the series has a mystical / spiritual feel. All the central performances are excellent. Hiroyuka Sanada is completely convincing as the would be Shogun, Lord Toranaga, but ultimately Anna Sawai steals the show. She gives an unforgettable and at times mesmerising performance as Lady Mariko, the character as a result of which we probably care for the most. It's beautifully filmed and feels like nothing else on tv at the moment. I'd highly recommend it.",9
"Great, Adult, Beautiful","I will mostly keep this review spoiler free and I will mark it as such, though it is impossible to talk about a 10 episode long mini series without at least hinting at things.Shogun is the best series I have seen in a while now. It is masterfully shot, with great effects for a series. At times the series even got me thinking that it looks better than some big budget movies. The core of the series is about 2 things. One is the culture shock from the point of view of John Blackthorne, the second is the internal meddling and politics in Japan. The culture shock provides all of the comic relief and fun in the series, the meddling provides the intrigue, backstabbing and suspense.I would call the series ""adult"". On the surface you could take that as there being nudity and gore, which there is. What I mean though, that there is a lot of things left unsaid. The series doesn't quite hold your hand and tell you everything outright. Though that leaves me somewhat unfulfilled after having finished the series, it is not really in a bad way. The conclusion feels as if two great chess players stood up from the table and walked away because they both realized the inevitable outcome, though to me, a casual viewer that is not quite clear. Even after getting an explanation that in 5 more moves that would lead to check mate, I feel a bit like I would have liked to seen those five moves. What that leads to, is me wanting to read the book and then rewatch the series to see if this time I could keep up with lord Toranaga. The ending would surely be more cathartic if all the cogwheels fell into place. I feel like the ending is dignified though and indeed fitting for the whole series. Through each episode I was entertained and so I can recommend it with no remorse.A sidenote: I usually choose to watch dubbed versions of series, so my wife could enjoy it with me, but with this one it is somewhat pointless. If the English spoken parts were to be dubbed, that would still leave about 60-70% of the runtime in Japanese, hence subtitles. I didn't mind though, it really fits the setting. Just be prepared to read a bunch, unless you are fluent in both English and Japanese.",9
"Best Samurai Series / Idea ð¡","The idea of the movie is insanely good, the actors are perfect, the story is new & interesting to watch, the way the series is moving is perfect, the variety of different people in the series is perfectly done, vision & recording is absolutely beautiful nothing more to say, I highly recommend to anyone that loves the japanese civilization & it's culture and traditions and has a good story to watch this series, to be honest this is the most liked series and the most vibe series I've ever seen in my life, I can't wait for the upcoming episodes, am sure it will be perfect, thank you for this excellent series.",8
"The ultimate disappointment","9 near perfect episodes then one of the worst endings of all time. The ending doesn't fit in with the show, they completely write the Anjin differently, right from the word go showing he gets back to England a grows old a feeble. Toronaga is revealed to be a power hungry warlord, which wasn't hinted at at all before this. It might have been a great twist if they had lent into it. Instead this amazing show ends with a whimper. The immense sacrifices that so many Honorable characters made turn out to be for nothing but one man's grab for power, a man who apparently has been secretly a sociopath the whole time who didn't care about the people who loved him and the dream of a free Japan. But if this was his character arc why when completely alone at his son's and best friend's funeral did he say to himself that their sacrifice would not be wasted. I'm so so sad and angry about this. The writing before this was truly incredible, it feels like the last episode was purposely tanked or written by a completely seperate group who hasn't seen the series up to that moment.This could have been a truly iconic series, a landmark in cinema and they spat on the ashes of what they had created.Definitely watch the show, just never watch the last episode.",8
"Weak adaptation with poor characters","Full disclosure: I love the original 1980 adaptation. Yes, it's a bit cheesy at times (here's looking at you, Richard Chamberlain) but overall it's a marvelous adaptation of a fairly mediocre novel.I can binge watch the entire 1980 adaptation in a day (and I have), no problem. It's that captivating. The 2024 adaptation however took perhaps two or three weeks to get through. Only once, if memory serves me right, did I watch more than one episode in a row. I took a break for about a week or so after the second or third episode simply because it never grabbed my attention. It's not bad, it's mediocre, just like the novel.It is interesting to witness two completely different adaptations of the same source material.The 1980 adaptation is basically a fish out of water narrative almost exclusively told from Blackthorne's perspective where he is stranded in a strange, foreign land whose society and customs we learn along with him. More than that, we the viewers also learn snippets of the language along with him.The 2024 adaptation is closer to the novel whose second half in particular is devoted to an intricate Japanese power struggle a la Game of Thrones. This, incidentally, is also the least intriguing thing about the novel, and the TV show does not surpass its source material. For anyone who has read the novel, it surely doesn't come as a surprise that they would up the sex and blood in this new adaptation. And finally Mariko gets her B A moment which is absent from the 1980 adaptation.It's amusing to read the reviews lamenting the blue balls ending to the show. A ton of build up promising a final confrontation, and then nothing. That's taken straight out of the novel.The point where this adaptation fails are the characters who are poorly introduced and defined. They mostly melt into the wallpaper. I have both read the novel (as recently as last year) and must have watched the 1980 adaptation at least a half dozen times (low ball estimate) yet it took quite some time before I realized ""Wait, that's Omi? And *that's* Buntaro??"". They came off as extras, not as vital characters to the plot.The guy playing Blackthorne is doing Richard Burton for some reason. Other than that, he's OK. Although he seems to be almost fluent in Japanese quite fast, using words that we as an audience have not seen him faced with earlier. Blackthorne and Mariko have absolutely zero chemistry in this adaptation. It's like watching a vacuum. As for Sanada, he lacks the natural authority of Mifune.Visually, it is quite honestly a let down. Yes, beautiful costumes and wigs. But the VFX work is surprisingly shoddy. Take the scenes on the boat, for instance. No doubt nowhere near water but shot on a parking lot with a blue screen. I'm reminded of the director's commentary track to The Naked Gun where they joke about their cinematographer being the only one who can make a location look like a set thanks to poor lighting. The roto work, especially in their hair, is a fuzzy mess. I fully understand shooting action scenes in a controlled environment. But regular sailing shots in beautiful weather on calm seas? This just came off as lazy.But it's not only the boat. It's basically any show where you see more architecture than a wall or wooden hut (sometimes even nature) in the background.The PR for this show drones on and on about its ""authenticity"", yet it was shot in Canada. I'll tell you what, the 1980 adaptation got so much free authenticity just from being shot on location. When Blackthorne draws the world map in the gardens by the pond, it's really Hikone Castle (standing in for Osaka Castle) in the background. When Blackthorne and Mariko are strolling through the gardens, it's really Himeji in the background. As Blackthorne is escorted through the castle by brother Michael, the Japanese priest, near the end of the series, they blend seamlessly between Himeji and Hikone. If you go to these locations (as I have) you can literally walk in their footsteps. Now that's authenticity.",5
"If you liked the Chamberlain /81 series, you will love this, too!","After episodes 1 and 2, I dug for The 'original' with Richard Chamberlain, king of mini-series, and acquired the 6-Dvd set (I just reviewed it at IMDB). So, typically, a remake is usually inferior, eh? Not so this time! ANJIN-san is well-played by a Liam Neeson cutout called COSMO JARVIS (not Kramer). The actor for the Toronaga warlord must be a relative of the original, or maybe a cyber- preserved same guy from 1981?Since I never read the lengthy book( historical fiction), I cant help you with that comparison, but the screenplay is written with less need for sub- titles or Orson Welles narration. (The old entry had lengthy speeches that were unexplained--unless you spoke Japanese). The Eastern customs and manners are quite ancient and clash with Western. Anjin-san, our fiery protagonist, must sort these out, if he hopes to survive.Toronaga, his 'sponsor warlord ' has a similar struggle on his hands, and finds Anjin a useful ally. Well, as the Eagles say, You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.10/10 fantastic! Tnx Disney!",10
"AMAZING!","This is one of those series you should never miss. Everything is top notch and detailed! I'd recommend even for my enemy. The plot, the costume, setting, dialogue, character and acting comes with the best quality you'd see in today's cinematic production. I literally can't get enough of the acting as every role was netted out perfectly. I've always known the Japanese were big on honor, respect and integrity but watching this series unfold takes you to the deeper part of their history and how they turned to be one of the leading nations worldwide today while they still maintain their culture. Honestly, you should give it a watch because there's a lot you're missing if you don't if you're a moviedict.",10
"Shows Much Promise","Visually stunning with good acting, dialogue, direction. Japanese representation is extremely authentic and feels like a native high-budget period piece (jidaigeki).Unfortunately, people unfamiliar with the historical backdrop and the characters might find the first episode to be a bit confusing and overwhelming with many characters introduced in a short period of time amid multiple international tensions. Those familiar with the original series or the books should be fine, and the rest of the series should be more enjoyable once the main characters and their roles are firmly fleshed out. If the production value continues in this manner, I very much look forward to the rest of this series.",9
"Great telly!!","Forget what you remember from the 80s. This is awesome viewing and I can't wait for a sequel.The acting, sets, effects are all superb and the story has always been good.Admittedly, sub titles are never fun but certainly necessary and for this series they seem to flash up pretty quick resulting in often having to flick back. Deffo demands concentration but worth it.This started off as something nostalgic having memories of the 80's books and TV but has earned its place in modern epic serialised drama with all the suspense, laughs, sadness and shock you would expect and more.On another level, there is also a lot to be learned and appreciated about cultural integration.",9
"Would recommend","Shogun is one of the series that someone must watch! The costumes, the acting, even the scenery are. Immaculate. Watching just the first episode is enough to get you hooked to watch the rest. If you are a fan of the historic periods of japan or even with historic events alone, you will be amazed with the dedication put on the series to achieve just that.However, being a series of 12 episodes , it would be extremely hard to fit all of the story itself since the book is too big and one series with so little episodes wouldn't be able to showcase everything that happened thus, it ended up being rushed through the story without that much of a detail , unlike the book itself, many things weren't fully explained. Also personally the death of mariko left me a bit bitter since i found her character really interesting and i though she would have more potential as a character further in the story if the series ends up having a second series.But other than that, i would 100% recommend this series since the story and all the dedication that was put into the making was honestly amazing!",8
"A fearsome medieval time","The tension and fierceness of the inevitable war was well depicted in ""Shogun"", giving the vibes of ""Game of Thrones"". What makes it more fearsome is the political players not only have the calculation and intelligence, but they also naturally manipulating human lives as mere chess pieces to achieve strategic and tactical goals.In medieval times, death was common, but more so in Medieval Japan than other places. This was explained as the result of the harsh environment with earthquake and tsunami, and hunger and typhoon and winter all on a not overly large land surrounded by the ocean. It is unsurprising that death is a prominent theme in this series. The TV series did a good job exploring one aspect, that is, people accept death naturally and try to make their death useful for some greater purposes, like loyalty or honor.However, it mischaracterized another important aspect, that is, people still want to live even on a harsh land where death is so common and defeat means certain death. In such a place, everyone would fight with greater ferocity to avoid defeat, and for those who cannot avoid defeat, they accept death naturally and try to make it more meaningful.",8
"So far, so very good","The cinematography is amazing. The lightening is perfect even in the night. The dialogue and conversations are funny yet intelligent. Almost every scene is filled with suspense. Its a historical fiction in a way so its not going to be exactly like the book. Its been a while I have been so excited about a TV show. This is amazing on every scale. Only time will tell if it will be on par with great shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones but so far, so very good. The director compared the politics of Shogun to succession. The politics and power play is just so exciting to watch unfold. If you are a lover of historical T. V. series, I urge you to watch this series and you will be glad.",10
"One of the greatest achievements in tv history!","I can't stress enough how good this show is! It is intense, beautiful, and intriguing in every moment. I can't take my eyes off the screen when Shogun is on; the story the acting (Hiroyuki Sanada is mesmerizing, as always), the wardrobe, and set designs are beyond phenomenal. I never read the book but I'm going to now, and I fear it won't live up to the show (and I'm a reader so i can't even think of an example where the live-action version of a book was better than the book).I hope the creative team does more after this limited series because they have an amazing team right now. If u only have the time or the bandwidth (mentally) for one serious show, make it this one. You won't be disappointed.",10
"Disappointed","I agree this show excells in many aspects, i.e. Production design, the use of the two languages, costumes, sound, etc... However when it comes to the plot i was expecting something else. I was looking for a more action based series, but instead i got endless political disputes and human relationships that didn't make too much sense (at least for my western mind)When i say this i don't mean the story is not interesting and i'm sure it is very accurate and inspired by actual events. I just don't think it was the most appropiate story to tell for a tv show. On top of that, the ending just didn't deliver. Especially when the whole time we are told there's a huge battle incoming and in the end there is none. Not only that, we also find out that all the protagonist did was meaningless and it was all part of Toranaga's plan...",7
"A fantasy spreading disinformation about Japan","I watched the first episode and found it lacking in historical accuracy regarding Japan. The show portrays Japanese people treating foreigners with extreme cruelty, such as boiling them alive or urinating on them, which lacks historical evidence. While the series is based on James Clavell's novel, which is inspired by true events, many elements are fictionalized or exaggerated. The real William Adams, on whom the character John Blackthorne is based, was treated as a trusted advisor by Tokugawa Ieyasu, not with hostility. The series dramatizes historical events, often prioritizing storytelling over accuracy. Just a non-asian fantasy portraying poorly Japan, and I say this as a European!",1
"In retrospect","I havent read the book and only have a vague recolection of the 1980's mini series. So really this is a relativly first time experience with the marvelous world of Shogun. I scored it initially a 10 after a few episodes. Although I have to admit some doubt started creeping in around episode 4.I think if I had binge wached this I would have scored it a solid 9. I think the fist half of the series is superior to the latter half. The final episode, with a major character missing, was a little bit flat.To be fair I was unsure what I was expecting. It did all seem to fade out rather than go out with a bang.This may sound overly critical . As a whole its brilliantly acted , beautifully filmed and has an intrigueing story line. Also to . The western eye, it could well have been a total fantasy as the Japanese culture is such a mystery and seems so alien.Not perfect but highly recommended.",10
"A great production","I think it's too early to make deep comparisons between this series and its predecessor from 1980. In my opinion, this production is much more believable in terms of realism, production, direction, characters, atmosphere, and effects than the one from 1980. Its main protagonist H. Sanada is also of a superior and more experienced acting quality in my understanding than R. Chamberlain as the main actors without ceasing to recognize the excellent interpretation of Cosmo Jarvis. Anna Samai, among others. For the moment, all the main and secondary roles have an outstanding performance.It is a great production and excellent actors.",10
"best show of the year so far","I'm sure everyone has heard about Shogun by now but if you haven't, what are you waiting for? It's basically Game of Thrones in feudal Japan but that description really sells it short. It's better than that.Instead of having a fantasy society to build, it delves into the real society of feudal Japan, with its own set of stringent rules that sometimes can seem alien and incomprehensible to the single European in the story who is a major character, John Blackthorne.Blackthorne starts as a churlish pirate/sailor (though he disputes being a pirate) and over the course of the season, evolves tremendous growth. The other major characters have amazing journeys of their own: Toranaga, a descendant of ancient Shoguns, who is suspected by others in the samurai class of wanting to revive that title; and Lady Mariko, a steely, intelligent and elegant interpreter for Blackthorne.Don't be put off by the fact that the dialogue is almost all subtitled Japanese. You get used to it quickly.Supposedly this is a miniseries but I don't believe it. It's too popular and where the story ends feels like a prelude to a bigger story.",9
"High quality series but....","For me, a very well constructed and conducted series.Beautiful shots and interesting (alternative to the famous Shougun from 1980) plot conducting.I would rate the whole thing 10 however there is a 'but' - the main character or rather the character created by Cosmo Jarvis.Flat acting, all emotions in 3 sets of faces, dialogues as if read from a prompter (those in English). From episode to episode it gets worse and worse because ... all the same alle the time regardless of the emotion of a scene. Too bad!I'm very sorry Mr. CJ, but unfortunately ... in the whole series he is the weakest part of the show.Nevertheless, I recommend and encourage you to watch.I, certainly longing for good acting, and I am going back to Shogun with Richard Chamberlain.",8
"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent.","Well it has come to an end after 10 episodes, and what is there to say about ShÃ´gun, but Excellent, Excellent, Excellent, a total masterpiece in cinematic quality, in every detail.This is a must see television series, and one of the best series I've watched in a long, long time, I was a little unsure of Cosmo at the beginning, in the first couple of episodes, but Cosmo grew on me as the episodes progressed, and he filled out his character a little more as the series went on.Recently I read they might well produce a second season, even though this is based on a single book, and pretty much the story is played out, but I do hope there is a second series and then some, as the ending certainly seemed to say there is more for the characters in this series and more to say in their saga.Overall a massive 10/10 from me, well worth a binge over a wet and miserable weekend.",10
"Great First 3 Episodes","I thoroughly enjoyed the first three episodes and look forward to the remaining seven episodes. The whole show was mesmerising from the backdrop of 1600's Japan to the intricacy of character development is done with finesse.The clash of different people and the language barrier at the beginning made this intriguing then Mariko acting as the translator made it more enjoyeable especially when James is trying to get his point across to the other Japanese characters.It'll be very more interesting with the Catholic and Protestant line in the story and how it'll all come to a head sometime near the endI absolutely love Mr Sanada and his acting ability especially from John Wick 4 but here in his own language he can express himself much more freely. The rest of the cast do a great job too and bring the characters to lifeI have already bought the audiobooks by James Clavell and ordered the paperback edition of Shogun which I'm excited to read.Overall the first few episodes were a great start to this amazing series and look forward to my weekly fix of storytelling.",9
"A Visual Masterpiece","This production is top notch but doesn't really do the Novel justice. If you crave more Shogun you need to read James Clavell's masterpiece. The show diverges quite a bit from the real story.Positives are the visuals and I love the casting of Lord Toranaga and Lady Mariko, I'm glad they had the characters speak in Japanese.Whomever was in charge of the wardrobes deserves an award, simply stunning and historically accurate.Negatives, the casting of Blackthorne not the best, and how short the episodes were, to many plot lines left open (Read the Novel)Overall fantastic to watch, Best show this last couple of years.",9
"Best television since way too long time.","""Shogun"" emerges as a captivating journey into the heart of medieval Japan, showcasing valor, intrigue, and cultural richness with unparalleled finesse. The series not only transports viewers to a bygone era but immerses them in its intricacies, thanks to its meticulous attention to detail and historical accuracy.One of the standout features of ""Shogun"" is its breathtaking cinematography, which beautifully captures the essence of feudal Japan. From sweeping landscapes to intimate character moments, every frame is a visual feast that enhances the storytelling experience.As we revel in the triumph of ""Shogun,"" one can't help but hope for more television shows to follow in its footsteps, striving for the same level of quality and dedication to storytelling. In an age of endless content, ""Shogun"" stands tall as a shining example of what television can achieve when excellence is the ONLY guiding principle.",10
"Not worth watching . Specially if compared with the old one.","I can only find two good things about the new version. It looks very good. The level of production is very high. And some of the actors did a good or at least decent job...but not many.As the story progress it gets worst and worst basically in every way (ecept production) to the point of not making sense. For me it was a strugle to watch it till the end.Of course the old one has its flaws. Some very notorious like the hair pieces. But then again is a production of another time.To wrap this up i would say that the perfect Shogun would be about 80~90% of the old one and 20 ~10% of the new one.",5
"Must watch! Great acting, direction and dialogues","Shogun is not just a TV series. It's a long beautiful poem. Everything about Shogun is just spot on, be it the acting, the poetry, direction, screenplay and most importantly the depth of characters. One of the best series of all times. The show taught me so much about life and living mindfully.My favorite character is Mariko. Anna Sawai plays the role with such grace and centerness juxtaposed to John Blackthornes personality. The chemistry between the two transports you to another world.The crew have placed immense attention to detail. The costume design and cinematography take you to 1600s Japan. This is a must watch show!",10
"English is Portuguese??","Beautiful and amazing tv show portraiting one of the best Eras of my country Portugal which I'm so proud of.If you can have a tv show with a very complicated language as Japanese to be spoken whats the excuse with Portuguese. Because if you had to put Spanish language, they wouldn't hesitate. But Portuguese for many directors, movie producers is a monster to learn or put in movies. We have so many brilliant actors, Joaquim de Almeida is in the show , we have Diogo Morgado also, Nuno Lopes, who could have been in this show and speak Portuguese to give even more credibility to the show.I think the lack of real Portuguese spoken here is a big flaw. That's the reason why I don't give 10 stars.",9
"Finally! What an Achievement!!","This has been a long time coming. I read the original novel at someone's recommendation back when it came out. Especially being a big fan of Japanese cinema, and specifically Toshiro Mifune and samurai movies, I couldn't wait for the original series to come out. What a let down it was. Toshiro Mifune was criminally under used, and as I later found out that was a trend for him in any American production, possibly save Midway. This production is all about the Japanese, the language, the dress, the culture, and it is excellent. Needless to say, I loved it. Hiroyuki Sanada, who plays the lead character of Toronaga (The role that Toshiro Mifune played in the original series) deserves even more credit as one of the main producers dedicated to keeping it true to life as a producer as well. He worked tirelessly on this production, hiring many Japanese actors, arts and crafts experts, etc. Kudos to all.",10
"Beautiful Series. Shogun, Sugoi!","If you're a fan of historical dramas and political intrigue, ""Shogun"" is likely to capture your attention. Based on the 1975 novel by James Clavell of the same title, the series narrates the gripping tale of English sailor John Blackthorne (portrayed by Cosmo Jarvis), who finds himself shipwrecked in Japan. Aligning with the powerful daimyo, Lord Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), Blackthorne becomes embroiled in a deadly conflict with rival daimyos and religious zealots determined to overthrow Toranaga.One of the series' standout features is its rich character development. The protagonists, especially Lord Toranaga, are not only compelling but are portrayed with depth and complexity. Toranaga's wisdom and strategic acumen, turning seemingly dire situations to his advantage, are particularly fascinating and kept me thoroughly engrossed.The casting and performances are exceptional, vividly conveying the tensions of strict Japanese cultural norms and the overarching political machinations. The focus on the characters' emotions enhances the narrative, supported by subtle yet effective cinematography and lighting. The use of natural lighting enriches the authenticity of the setting, transporting viewers to the era of feudal Japan.Having watched all 10 episodes, I was impressed by the well-paced script that maintains suspense and engagement throughout, culminating in a finale that leaves one eagerly anticipating the next season.Moreover, the historical accuracy concerning the rise of the Tokugawa shogunate adds a layer of educational value, enriching the viewer's experience as the story unfolds.",9
"Transportive. Soulful. Wonderful.","As of the first season (10 Episodes), Shogun becomes an all-time calibre series, to me personally.The soul and allusion that is captured in the 10-episode pilot season is masterful, and seems unattainable by the majority of current big-budget studios; as the world moves away from cinema and towards overtly-dramatic, and (often) excessively drawn out TV series' -Shogun is anything but.For a story which wallows in traditional politics, Shogun refuses to bore the viewer for a moment throughout its duration; telling its story through use of poetic script-writing, intentional body language, soundtrack, cinematography and most importantly, these terrific acting performances.I would watch through this series again and again, in hopes of recapturing the allure which swallowed me up on my first watch-through.",9
"A taste of nostalgia...","It's great to watch again a series we enjoyed from the 1980s.He beautifully portrayed Japanese culture, the western world's view of the east, and the political influence of the clergy, or more precisely the missionaries, on the countries they visited.Each episode of the series has a different excitement and a different tradition. This creates an incredible curiosity in the audience. So much so that you can't wait for the next episode.I wish this series would have lasted 3-5 seasons... but it didn't!Of course, one can't help but wonder, are there still people with such strong characters in Japan?",8
"A reasonably faithful retelling so far","9-9.5? No. We'll see how it progresses, but it's solid so far. I'm also a big fan of the original mini-series and this this one has A LOT to live up to. We'll see how they compare over the course of the series, but they've certainly favoured noticeable CGI over authenticity in some locations and 'camera' shots. If I had a gripe through 2 episodes it would be the portrayal of female characters. IMO, the series has ignored the status of women - even those of higher status - in feudal Japan in favour of a more contemporary portrayal. If you haven't seen the original, I recommend you do. Melodramatic period style aside, it's really expansive and epic.",8
"Instant classics and a television masterpiece","There are some series that become instant classics. Game of Thrones. Band of Brothers. Breaking Bad...to name but a few. This version of SHOGUN is one of them.Over 10 perfectly paced, acted, written and directed episodes it introduces us to the culture and customs of Feudal Japan in the 1600s.The acting really is off the scale, most notably from Anna Sawai as the graceful and fearless Lady Mariko (outstanding!), Hiroyuki Sanada as the calculating Lord Toranaga and Cosmo Jarvis as the seafaring British John Blackthorne who is marooned in Japan and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between The Council of Regents. Jarvis really comes into his own in the finale and delivers a powerhouse performance.This series is magnificent and is sure to sweep the awards come the time. How would a rate it out of 10? I'd give it 11 ðð",10
"Okay but highly overrated","I watched the Shogun series as soon as it came out, said ""Okay, it's watchable"", and forgot about it. Now I found out it won a record number of Emmys, okay, but then I saw it has 8.6/10 on IMDB, and I was like, WHAT? I don't know how anyone could rate this show that high, I mean, it's almost god tier.The problem for me is that the story isn't interesting, at least the way they showed it. They hired Hiroyuki Sanada, they showed the love line between Anjin and Mariko, but for me it all doesn't work. I saw all of that in The Last Samurai, and it works great there. I saw a wise Japanese man, I believed that Tom Cruise's character was learning to understand Japan and the Japanese, their philosophy, their outlook on life. In Shogun Sanada is acting like the cool Japanese guy again, nothing new. Cosmo Jarvis is definitely bad as Anjin, from the beginning till the end his character is basically undeveloped and looks like a dog who doesn't know where he is and what to do, maybe it was intentionally, but I didn't like it, I mean why is that? I want to see the character development. Game of thrones is also poorly shown here, everyone except Ishido is completely faceless and static. Generally, I can say I didn't care about what happened there and about all the characters, except Fuji, she's cute. And: there's almost no action in the series. Yes, now I know it's a chess game, but what they showed in the trailer hinted that there would be action. Heck, you showed Toranaga wearing armor and riding a horse with a sword in the poster!So, I think the series is okay. 8.6/10? Hell no.",6
"Waste of time","All the promotions going for Shogun is a huge lie. Just done episode 10 and it was a struggle to finish the drama. All the anticipation from last year is poof gone. Now am an advocate to say its an utter waste of time.Not sure why the critics are praising the drama. But from a normal person perspective, the story lack a lot of things. And to unnecessarily added the few ""pillowing"" scenes was so irrelevant. Not sure whom are they trying to attract by having those scenes.The trailer shows an imminent war, real drama no such thing. Everyone dressed up like for real but to have conversations about the war.Jumping here and there the story. It was really difficult to digest and appreciate the drama. The only thing the producers and directors did right is hiring this group of people who acted real well in their roles.Apart from all this, nothing great to shoutabout.",1
"You don't need to play audio of people slurping their drinks every minute to inform us that people in Japan slurp.","I get that people in Japan slurp their drinks, but there's no need to play constant slurping every minute to convey that to a U. S. demographic. Everytime someone is eating, you'll hear slurp slurp slurp slurp. It's gross and adds nothing to the story. If you can get past that, it's a great and gripping show.

"Get down!!! The cannons are coming! ,,This is not how samurai fights"" - this scene should be watched.","If you want to see proper seppuku, watch this, not ,,Harakiri"" (1962).I think this TV series is authentic and they manage to capture Japanese manners well. The creators represented 1600s with attention to detail. Even they speak in old Japanese. This production really shines with costumes, make-up and cinematography - it just pleases the eye. If you are admirer of a brutal and bloody massacre - there are a few scenes you will like.I like many things in that TV series but there are two main flaws:
the story after 6 episode is bad presented: it builds very slowly and stays vague till the endmain character - Cosmo Jarvis (John Blackthorne): for me his acting is way too simple compare to others (for example without Anna Sawai and Fumi NikaidÃ´, whole atmosphere want be the same). Other characters are well selected.I didn't regret watching this movie.",8
"Some impressive parts","First part:
A Japanese samurai was sentence to suicide for his insult to the Regent Council,even the samurai's new born baby was asked to die! Everytime I thought on the killed baby,I even can't breath and feel sick.Making me more impressive was attitude of surrounding Japanese ,who took the baby's death as it should be,Lady Mariko even persuaded and comforted the baby's mother to accept this merciless sentence. Until then I realized that it's a culture and a group psychology status,not only an individual cruel behavior simply.Second part:
A civilian was beheaded in the public street by lord only because he asked one word about the John Blackthorne who was just captured by the Japanese. These surrounding civilians hadn't shown any protest and took it as deserved.Third part:
John Blackthorne's old gardener was sentence to suicide only because of taking away a rotten chick hanging under the eave,touching which was banned by John Blackthorne earlier. Although John Blackthorne took his ban as a joke,but the reality was cruel.Fourth part:
when John Blackthorne instigated the Lord Kashigi Yabushige to climb down the dangerous cliff to save the Spanish sailor,Lord Kashigi struggled severely in the heavy wave. Instead of asking for help, his choice was going to suicide.Fifth part:
In the end of this season,Lord Kashigi Yabushige, a sly double-dealer,was sentence to suicide by Lord Yoshii Toranaga. Even such sly and ambitious person was willing to accept this sentence without any defence for himself, without any trick or resistance.I think these events above can't be only explained as an individual feature simply,such as numb or ruthless. In my deductions, in ancient Japan,death might not be treated as a punishment, also might not be regarded as a stupid loyalty to the superior lord,it might be took as a relief at that time.Dilemmas were everywhere in this world,but how to treat these dilemmas were various from country to country. It seemed ancient Japanese cared too much about these dilemmas, and led to a living environment full of paradoxes and contradictions which became more and more burden on their lives. It might be that who can live in the stress of these paradoxes was respected in ancient Japanese culture. People at that time didn't try to solve these paradoxes but kept in the balance of these paradoxes, liking walking on the high-wire. Of course,there would be more and more burdens were piled up in their mind.So naturally, resistance or escape was not an option ,because it would prolong their pain and increse their burden.Sixth part:
The relationship between Lady Mariko and her husband can be seen as a miniature of ancient Japanese social.Her husband,a samurai Toda hiroshige, was extremely love her actually,but what he treated to her wife coldly, instead of love. Outward reason is that it would been regarded as weak if a samurai immersed in love affairs. While the deep reason was that love was so expensive in a highly stressed social in ancient Japan,one couldn't afford such heavy additional cost.For the same reason,Lady Mariko chose to ignored his husband even when she was suffered her husband's violence. Anger was so expensive and should be given to a man she had never loved.Seventh part:
Lady Mariko was sent to Osaka for carrying out Lord Yoshii Toranaga's scheme,that pushed the whole storyline to climax.Only outstanding Yoshii had recognized the key point to success is the awakening of power center rather than a powerful military. The power center means the members in Regent Council and the successor's mother.Lady Mariko's brave struggle awaked these hostages to face the fact that Lord Ishido held them by force was a violation to the social order at that time. Lord Ishido broke rule and brought additional stress should be punished.",9
"Simply amazing","This mini series is so far away from my usual watch. But I loved every second of it, beautifully put together, amazing acting and powerful story!This was such a special mini series and I just hope that a season two would be possible. It's opened my eyes to watching things I wouldn't normally, watch. I didn't even have my phone in my hand for any of it because I was hooked from the beginning with complex characters and vibrant culture! It is more than worth watching, it deserves its current rating! I loved delving into a different culture and even didn't mind subtitles it was that good! Watch it I guarantee you will love it!!",10
"Great show with some innaccuracies","I read the book many years ago, and barely remember the first TV adaptation. This means I'm watching this new series for what it is, and very little, if any, expectations from either the book or the 1984 series.Two episodes in, I was considering this to be an easy 9 stars, with the possibility of reaching 10 by the end of the series. The cast is excellent, landscapes are beautiful, wardrobe superb, and the dialogs captivating. I was very happy to hear each character speaking his original language instead of that silly thing many productions do by having everybody speaking in english with stupid accents (remember AllÃ´, AllÃµ!).And then, the show lost a star in my rating when a spanish character speaks in english with the englisman (who, at some point, claims to speak some portuguese). This becomes even more absurd when portuguese and spaniards speak english among themselves. And there are at least two portuguese actors who, again, speak english pretending to speak portuguese! Just pathetic and sad.Another star was lost when the main character starts describing the world, and how the portuguese and the spaniards divided the world in two. The acting is great and with a strong emphasis on how presumptuous it was for those two countries to assume they could just own the world.However, the historic innaccuracies are unacceptable in a show with so many resources available. How hard is it to do some research about the treaty of Tordesilhas?! They could've easily learn that it happened in 1494, about 100 years before the action of the show takes place and not 70 like mentioned by Blackthorne.But that could be a minor mistake until they start talking about how the portuguese and the spanish kings are working together to control the world. That never happened because Portugal and Spain were always enemies. In fact, the english were allies with Portugal even though the first being protestants and the latter catholics. And that description by Blackthorne becomes even more incorrect because it ignores the fact that at the time of the action and for the previous 20 years, Portugal was being ruled by the spanish kings (until 1640)!What a pity... This show could be quite better!PS: after finishing watching the last episode, I reviewed my own rating and raised it to 9. Unlike many who were hoping for some great battle fought by vast armies like many other shows, Shogun finishes with an epilogue after an intense, multi stages, battle fought by a single woman. Epic!",9
"Hulu offers dubbed option!","I don't know why people are complaining about the subtitles. Personally, we preferred the original version. We found it much more authentic and enjoyed hearing the native tongue of its country of origin. However, what doesn't make any sense are those reviewing the show rating with a 1-star lamenting there wasn't an option to watch with English audio when THERE IS! We tried the dubbed version, the bilingual actors dubbed their own characters and those who spoke only Japanese were replaced with bilingual Japanese voice actors. Both options were great but as I mentioned, the original version was best for us.At any rate, this show was awesome. My only complaint is the number of episodes. Somehow the ending felt both slow and rushed. Would have loved to see Toranaga's plans fully played out and maybe how Blackthorne successfully returned to England. Otherwise, one of the best limited series I've seen. Two thumbs up.",10
"Great series, though far from perfect","It is the year 1600. A Dutch ship runs aground on the shores of Japan. Leader of the few survivors of its starved, diseased crew is Englishman John Blackthorne, the pilot. The crew soon become prisoners of the Japanese who, influenced by the local Portuguese priests, enemies of the English and Dutch, treat them as savages and pirates. Unbeknownst to Blackthorne he has arrived at a crucial juncture in the history of the land, with political machinations shaping power. His path is soon crossed with that of Lord Yoshii Toranaga, one of the five rulers of Japan and a man that will have a significant bearing on Blackthorne's fate.Great series, weaving the story of Blackthorne, a stranger in a strange land, against the political struggle between fierce, cunning adversaries in a struggle for power, particularly that of Lord Toranaga.While the political machinations are there from the start, initially the series is more about how Blackthorne gets to be in Japan and meet Toranaga and the culture clashes that ensue. The cultural aspect supplies decent amounts of humour as well as thought-provoking contrasts.Once the background is established the political aspect start to come more to the fore. This is interesting but also to the series' detriment as the machinations are often complex and confusing. Adding to the complexity is a host of characters whose backgrounds and relationships to other characters are important to the plot yet, due to the large numbers of them, are often difficult to place.Another negative is the pace. Once everything is set up you'd think the plot would develop quite quickly but it tends to develop in fits and starts. There'll be long stretches of very little plot development followed by a major leap forward, making you think things are going to ratchet up, only for another lull to occur. The lulls aren't necessarily boring as they are often used to develop characters and the relationships between characters but things do feel rather drawn out.This said, it's a very interesting, well-made series, quite poetic in its plot, themes, sub-plots and settings. With the groundwork laid in Season 1, hopefully subsequent seasons can build upon this and turn the series into something truly epic and spectacular.",8
"Best thing on telly for years","This is the best new show in a loooooooooooooooooooooong time. Highly recommend for anybody, especially those who enjoy historical or fantasy genres.The acting, costume design, and cinematography are all absolutely outstanding.Each episode is going from strength to strength and we were gutted to hear there are no plans for a season 2. We look forward to this every Tuesday and it's the highlight of our TV schedule.The only confusing thing is the realisation that they're supposed to be speaking in Portuguese when they are conversing in English - it took a while for the penny to drop there.",10
"Overrated","Might be the most overrated show of all time. A glorified soap opera. I have only got to episode 9 and hope of something, anything besides endless dialogue, for something to happen. I have only given it a 5, because it is shot well. Beautiful scenery. Besides that, waist of time. And the mane guy isn't the best. His acting is as one dimensional as it gets. I truly don't understand the hype. Maybe is there was, I hate to say it, but a little bit of action? I love Japanese history and samurai's, but you never see them actually be samurai. Just walking around wearing swords, teasing is lol. Let them blades go!",5
"Absolutely amazing","If you watch just one tv show during the year 2024, let it be Shogun. The fine details of everything in this show will please you a lot. Dresses are amazingly beautiful and accurate. Also the cultural habits and doings are pure gold.It's a story of honor, serving something bigger than yourself and making sacrifices which will cost everything you have.I just finished the 10th episode and it's a bit difficult at the moment to think anything but I'm gonna to rewatch this after a week or so.Very interesting to see this story again, I remember the original Shigun but this is much better carefully made with lots of love. Hiroyuki Sanada is amazing in his role as Toranaga. Also Anna Sawai is perfect for the role of Lady Mariko. I also loved Moeka Hoshi as Usami Fuji. She was a very strong, yet sensitive character of her dramatic life. Excellent performance.",10
"Shogun: A Masterpiece Unrivaled","""Shogun"" delivers a captivating blend of historical drama and epic storytelling that keeps viewers hooked from the first episode to the last. Set in feudal Japan, the series immerses audiences in a world of political intrigue, cultural clashes, and personal struggles for power and survival. The production values are top-notch, with stunning cinematography and meticulous attention to detail in costume and set design. The ensemble cast delivers stellar performances, bringing depth and authenticity to their characters. While some pacing issues may arise in certain episodes, overall, ""Shogun"" offers a gripping narrative filled with suspense, emotion, and unexpected twists. It's a must-watch for fans of historical epics and anyone seeking a riveting journey into Japan's rich past.",8
"Good yes, but great?","This is a good show and has held my interest though it's a bit slow at times and over-wrought with ritual and the relentless threat of suicide. It's like if you spill a cup of coffee you may as well plunge a knife into your gut because you've forever shamed yourself, your entire family and any pets you may have.This is the 2020s where we can't have a white male coming into an indigenous society and becoming a savior, so John Blackthorne is kind of a bumbling fool in this show and the real hero is Mariko, our strong female lead with samurai skillz. She's not always likable with her inflexible attitude, but she's a compelling character acted well.Hiroyuki Sanada (Toranaga) does his usual exceptional acting job and overall this is a great cast playing roles to near perfection. The sets and CGI aerial shots of 1600s Japanese cities are fun and interesting to see what it might have looked like.There's a lot to like in this series but it also drags at times with the rituals and the attempted tension builds around whether someone will or won't actually commit seppuku, it just gets old after a while. How about an actual battle scene? It would have been nice after all this talk of Blackthorne's cannon tactics.",10
"A Masterpiece of Historical Drama","From the moment ""Shogun"" graced the screen, it was evident that this was not just another historical drama; it was a magnum opus that would redefine the genre. The meticulous attention to detail in every aspect of the show, from the intricate costumes to the authentic set designs, transports viewers directly into the heart of feudal Japan.The narrative is a compelling tapestry of political intrigue, romance, and cultural exchange, woven with such finesse that you cannot help but be utterly absorbed. The character development is sublime, with each episode peeling back layers to reveal the depth and complexity of figures like John Blackthorne, Toda Mariko, and Lord Yoshii Toranaga.Cosmo Jarvis delivers a riveting performance as Blackthorne, embodying the character with a raw intensity that captivates. Anna Sawai's portrayal of Mariko is nothing short of brilliant, bringing strength and vulnerability to her role in equal measure. And Tadanobu Asano's Toranaga is a force to be reckoned with, commanding every scene with a powerful presence.The show's score is a hauntingly beautiful accompaniment to the on-screen drama, enhancing the emotional weight of each scene. The cinematography is breathtaking, with each shot meticulously framed to capture the beauty and brutality of the era.""Shogun"" is a rare gem that not only entertains but educates, shedding light on a pivotal period in history with grace and respect. It's a show that doesn't shy away from the complexities of its characters or the era it depicts, making it a standout piece of television that deserves every bit of its acclaim.In conclusion, ""Shogun"" is a triumph in storytelling and production, a series that deserves its place among the pantheon of great TV shows. It's a definitive 10/10 on IMDb, and in the hearts of viewers who appreciate television that transcends entertainment to become art.",8
"Dubbed version or you'll lose viewers","I'm not a read the show kind of person. I want to enjoy the settings and the action on screen. Not try to read everything and glance up once in a while to see the scenery. I'm 20 minutes in and I can barely tell you what settings they been to. I'm to busy trying to read subtitles. I get the authentic vibe you're looking for and wanting the best Japanese actors. Now have them dub their own lines if they can speak even broken English. And dub actors for the rest of the cast. There has to be enough Japanese people to keep the acting in country. If that's what you're after. I believe that I'm in the majority on this stance.I've waited very eagerly for this to be released and I can't fully enjoy the show because I'm forced to read it.",10
"Perfect movie for someone who likes samurais and Japanese culture.","The 2024 Shogun is a stunning adaptation that beautifully reimagines the classic story with fresh energy and incredible attention to historical detail. Cosmo Jarvis delivers a powerful performance as John Blackthorne, while Hiroyuki Sanada brings depth and gravitas to Lord Toranaga. The series immerses you in the rich culture and complex political intrigue of 17th-century Japan, with breathtaking cinematography and an unforgettable story. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to Shogun, this is a must-watch for lovers of epic, character-driven drama!One of my favourite samurai shows so far. Loved it!",10
"When it's the better version.......","For those that were wishing for a remake of the 1980's series starring Richard Chamberlain, you're gonna be disappointed. But a fresh reimagining that expands on the source material and gives it fascinating characters, culture congruent interactions based on critical events in Japanese history......please, sir, may I have more.....
Great casting overall. I'm a HUGE Mufune fan and Sanada knocks it out of the park. All of the Japanese cast killed it as did the European/American crew. Highly recommended. Anna Sawai was amazing ( kinda showed how a crap Monarch script can overshadow a good cast) and oh my goodness Moeka Hoshi is a scene stealer. Too bad this is a limited series.",7
"An honest review","People drive me crazy when they all give 10's or 0's. Like there is nothing in between and they don't help at all. My 7/10 is based on the good and bad. The good is a great start and good story to tell. Done in Japanese with sub titles is the right way to have done it. The characters for the most part are good and it completes the story it was telling. It captures you for the most part and ties up story lines nicely. It is a one and done season which should be kept to a miniseries. The bad is some of the acting is not very good. The chemistry is poor between some actors. The middle of the season becomes a lower grade of quality than the rest for some reason. We never really get a Shogun that we all wanted to see. It is a good tv show but hearing they'll try for season 2 and 3 worries me that they will do what GoT season 8 did and it will be terrible. A lot of the characters were killed off that I personally liked, but I'm open to new ones. We'll see what season 2 brings, but I hope it brings the war and shogun for real this time. Turning this into what GoT should have been could be great. But I'm skeptical that will happen.",1
"I This This Tv Show Is Not Good Television","Shogun depicts ancient Japan at times when they have close connections with catholic driven Portugese then we see all of a sudden a dutch ship arriving whose purpose is to destroy the portugese plan to control Japan. Yes the plot seems very interesting and entertaining yet the execution is a lot to be concerned about because rather than showing how the dutch sailor showing the Japanese how to fight off the Portugese threat of occupying Japan territory they instead show ridiculous political drama between killing off the main character of the show through Sepuka a Japanese form of suicide and that is where my interest in the show dies off completely cause throughout the show we see this depressing suicides from multiple characters of the show. I do not understand what is the hype regarding this Tv Show as it really messed by head with depressing tones of suicide over and over again. Avoid at all times and do not be confused with the high ratings and critical acclaims of this tv show.",6
"Slow and Uninspiring, But Well-Directed","This series, unfortunately, did not live up to my expectations. I was initially intrigued by the premise, but as the episodes unfolded, I found myself increasingly disengaged. The pacing was excruciatingly slow, with events unfolding at a glacial speed. Watching each episode became less about enjoying the storyline and more about enduring it. It felt like psychological torture, as if I was forcing myself to watch out of obligation rather than genuine interest. There were moments when I questioned why I was continuing, yet I persisted, hoping it would pick up. Sadly, it never did, and the feeling of relief I experienced when an episode ended was telling.However, credit must be given where it's due. The direction was strong, with visually compelling scenes and a clear vision that was executed well. The atmosphere created was immersive, and the attention to detail in the cinematography was impressive. These aspects alone warrant some recognition, which is why I'm giving it a 6 out of 10. But ultimately, the sluggish pacing and lack of engaging content made this series more of a struggle to get through than a pleasure. It's not something I'd recommend to those looking for an engaging and dynamic viewing experience.",3
"Disappointing","I really really wanted to like this. I have read all of James Clavell's novels and I have seen the original series starring Richard Chamberlain and so I'm a huge fan of Shogun, that is the original story. But I am struggling to recognise much of this series, it looks great and the language and subtitles thing are not an issue for me, but I find it hard to follow and find myself losing interest and I doubt I will continue watching after this last episode 4. I don't understand why they have done this to this great story, the main character is awful, he annoys me more than any other aspect of this series. The only saving grace is the actor who plays Toranaga, he steals every scene he is in, but no matter how good the actors may or may not be, the story line is a mess and my advice is read the book, or watch the original series.",7
"This series tricks you and pretends there will be action","In each new episode, there is a new batch of random conversations between the characters. Only in the last five minutes of the series does any action take place. This leaves you hooked for the following episodes, but in the next episodes there will be the same narrative structure:More conversations between the characters and poor on-screen action in the last few minutes.I've already watched the first seven episodes and any rating that was made close to the series' release date should be redone.I believe that the only episode in which there will really be overwhelming action will be the last.",8
"Most overrated show of all time","I am leaving a 1 star review as a moral obligation to lower this outrageously high rating.In truth, the show is a 6/10. It is watchable but it is not great like the current 9.1 rating suggests. I did not find myself in suspense at all for the next episodes to be released.The episodes often drag out and get boring due to long, often pointless, scenes. Yet, ironically the actual timeline of events moves at a lightning pace. The whole premise of the plot is centred around the question ""what is Toranaga planning"".Except what he is planning becomes increasingly unrealistic, drawn out, convoluted, and unnecessarily secretive to the audience.",1
"Worth watching but some goofiness","From the start of the show there was some silly or goofy bad decisions.Such as putting blue contacts in the eyes of the actor that plays John Blackthorn. It makes him look like an alien or mermaid.I don't know if it's the actor or the directing but John Blackthorn is portrayed at a big goof. They made John into a fumbling fool. He is similar to Kelso from That 70s Show.This seems to be a story about one man's good luck. Actually it's more like great luck that never runs out.John Blackthorn doesn't earn anything. It seems as if this Mr Magoo like character stumbles into good fortune no matter how much he messes up.",7
"End ruined the whole show","The last episode ruined the entire series. They did a bait and switch as the main character ( Blackthorn) turns out to have no use at all the entire story. If you erased him from the entire show it would have had no effect whatsoever on the overall plot. The last episode I could almost here the Disney executives laughing that they sucked me in for a tenth week as they proceeded to tell me ( not show me, like Luke skywalker telling me how he flew down the the trench and blew up the Death Star ) how the big climax actually happened in the last episode. Wow talk about budget saving measures. I don't mind that Toronaga turned out to be the villain but show it don't cheap out and have him tell me this will happen. It's a show right, Not radio?",1
"Overrated","I started watching Shogun after hearing about its immensely high ratings and receiving strong recommendations from a friend. However, after giving it a fair shot, I found myself struggling to stay engaged. By the third episode, the pacing became unbearably slow, and the storyline failed to captivate my interest. It got so dull that I actually fell asleep during the third episode. Sadly, this show turned out to be a snooze fest for me, and I won't be continuing any further.In my opinion, Shogun is highly overrated. While it might have been groundbreaking in its time or appeals to a certain audience, the slow pacing and lack of engaging content left me wondering what all the hype was about. The show's reputation set high expectations, but it simply didn't deliver for me. If you're looking for something that keeps you on the edge of your seat, this might not be the right pick.",6
"Disappointed","The book was a masterpiece in story telling. Plots, subplots riddled with the fascinating Japanese culture and beliefs. Their sense of honour has no parallel. Hoped that the TV series would at least match the writing but in vain. The director just ruined it. For people who have not read the book please defer watching the series. It doesn't do justice to the book. It's a travesty to ruin such a beautiful story. These people should never be allowed to direct. What a loss. People go read the book. Give this abomination of a TV series a miss. If it was even half the the quality of the book it would have been a classic.",3
"Complete inconsistency with the book and the spirit of that time","Everything turned out to be very crumpled. The creators seemed in a hurry to finish the season as soon as possible. 80% of the events are cut out, which is why the characters are not revealed completely.Good costumes, architecture and half of the actors are not badly chosen.But they simply decided not to show extremely important events. He spent quite a long time in prison and studied culture and language there. There were many important events in the very first village. There were also many events at Ishida Castle. There is none of this, which is why the depth of the difference in cultures is not felt.Some tears from the Japanese of that time, sympathy, empathy are unnecessary... The authors of the series did not read the book at all and did not study the peculiarities of the religion and culture of that country...The bottom line is that it is impossible to transfer modern values and concepts of morality and honor to paintings shot about such a long time ago.For example, until 1700, in Japan, the murder of children was not punishable, and was considered absolutely normal. Their value was zero. And this was the case in almost all the big states of that time. And taking off.",6
"Sho Gun, So Boring!","""This film undeniably boasts good costumes and historically accurate characters. However, its progression is marred by monotony, often necessitating a conscious effort to continue watching. While the cast is extensive, their performances lack variety, with the exception of Kashigi Yabushige, who shines amidst the weak portrayals of others. Contrasting with Kurosawa's masterpieces, where each of the seven samurai was distinct, 'Shogun' lacks such distinctive characters. Additionally, the battle scenes in 'The Hidden Fortress' were far more impressive, with each shot conveying a unique message, complemented by the interplay of the main characters. Hence, the apt descriptor, 'Sho Gun, So Boring.'",5
"Fantastic show ruined by a rushed ending","There is much to like about Shogun. The imagery, acting and score are all great.I was immediately captivated from the first episode and watched the entire season in 3 days.However, halfway through the final episode, the climax was still nowhere in sight, and indeed the ending was essentially explained in a two minute montage of Toranaga's vision of how events would unfold from then on - and how he had known everything all along.It honestly felt like the producers of the show had planned for at least another whole season, or maybe two, just to have funding stopped halfway through the last episode of season one, and told to wrap things up right then and there.A very perplexing and unsatisfactory ending to an otherwise suberply crafted series which I do not see properly reflected in the many glowing reviews given by people having watched only the first couple of episodes.Also, the character arc of Blackthorne made me scratch my head. He is basically given nothing to do, and if he had been left out of the story entirely, it would not have changed the outcome in any way.For me, the extreme cultural differences that are experienced through him should have been a central aspect of the story, and his background, ressourcefulness and radical new ideas could have been used to explain the rising acknowledgement and respect he is given, but no - instead he just happens to be first on the spot to ease Toranaga out af a bad spot, and that is it - suddenly he is a lord...A final thing - thinking back on the way Toranaga's plan unfolded it was to a major extent based on his ability to predict how everyone around him would react to a rather long chain of events, including central players changing sides exactly when needed, allies betraying him at a specific time and so on - it all seems pretty far fetched the more I think abut it. No plan really - just a supernatural ability to read people and predict their actions. Personally, I would have preferred to see him prevail through superior strategy, leadership and cunning, not hyper-exaggerated mental manipulation...",6
"A complex story requires a complex review.","If you've never seen the 1980 original or read the novel, it's a 5 or 6 out of 10. It's a great and complex story with a lot of moving parts. It peaks around ep5 and gets worse with each episode after that. The ending will leave you scratching your head. My wife never watched or read the original and she liked a lot of this except the entire ep6 almost put us both to sleep and the ending infuriated her.If you've seen the original, but didn't read the novel it's a 4/10. I understand that they couldn't film on location in Japan, but the green screen and Canadian forests will take you right out of it. The original had hand built sets and custom made wardrobe. There are a few positives: They focus on plot points that they removed from the original like: The Erasmus payload, Crimson Sky, Lady Ochiba, and the Willow Women. They didn't do much of it very well though. The acting across the board is worse except for Yabu. That guy nailed it! The big 3: Toranaga, Blackthorne, and Mariko were pretty bad. Mariko looks like she's holding in a fart on every scene. Blackthorne is incompetent. Toranaga has one expression. The pacing is really sporadic. They'll gloss over important scenes like Blackthorne's growth in prison and dwell on lesser scenes like the Willow Women. At the midway point, you can feel them rushing the episodes to an ending that's among the worse I've ever scene.If you've read the novel and/or seen the original it's a 2/10. A few things were close to the book like the Vasco overboard scene and Ishido is closer to the novel than the original. Not much else is worthy of mention. In the opening scene when the captain kills himself, I knew this was gonna be a ""modern writers"" being cute affair. And it was. When FX announced they were tackling this, my 1st question was why? But the original was streamlined by Clavell himself to fit the format. I figured they could add the stuff that 1980 prime time tv wouldn't allow and it might be good. They didn't and it isn't. It's clear early on that the mouse is in charge and they want to keep their streak of terrible films intact. I felt like at any moment, Mariko would break out a light saber and bust into a rap about not needin' no man! Strong female lead is easy. Being feminine and complex requires skill. After the 5-6 episodes, I changed my view mentality from drama to comedy and it enabled me to get to the abysmal ending.",3
"Sad puppy eyes lead actor","What in gosh name's is wrong with the lead actor?First af all, they did him dirty when they put those blue contacts in his brown eyes. First thing I noticed in the first episode...
Second of all, he only has ONE expression in this whole series. Sad face , sad puppy eyes, poor little boy who has just been scolded by his mommy...
Really no other expression, love, dissappointment , anger, confusion.. nothing!And when he ""tries"" to show a different emotion, he justs screams and yells differently.And to finish my dissappointment... what's up with the grunting ""grrr"" , are we watching an anime?If they would have chosen someone with more life in their face maybe I would have another opinion but he just ruins the whole series.",6
"Did I Miss Something?","I must have done because I found Shogun one of the most tedious shows I have ever had to endure. You know a show is good when the time flies by and the episode is over before you realise it, well the exact opposite happened with Shogun. By the time I reached the end I felt I had climbed Mount Everest barefoot and blindfolded. The first 2 episodes are interesting enough with Blackthorne becoming stranded in medieval Japan and having to find his way through an alien land, all fair enough.Then the reming 8 episodes gets bogged down in intricate and tedious political manuvers of Japans feudal lords with endless loooong winded scenes of people sitting about yapping endlessly as the subtitles flies by. The translator girl was so gloomy with her endless whining about wanting to die I literally yelled with joy when she finally got her wish towards the end. If you have insomnia I can't reconnect Shogun enough, it will put you to sleep quick smart.",2
"If you've read this book you will be disappointed","The acting is great, the casting is great, the costumes amazing, the set etc, all amazing. I don't even mind that they de centralized Blackthorn's character, but their portrayal of him is unforgivable. Cosmo is clearly a great actor, and maybe a production team with a better sense of fidelity to the book could have made him a better Blackthorn, but I doubt it. Should have been played by an older, more fierce and rugged looking man, and portrayed in a more cunning, experienced and dangerous light. Cosmo looks young and soft, out matched and incidental. I have misgivings with the way all of the characters were portrayed- but all of the actors were superb. And the changes to the story- it's almost unrecognizable as ""Shogun"". And no where near as good. Read the book!",5
"Shogun 1980's was much better than this!","I was really really looking forward to seeing this NEW Shogun.It's got an amazing cast and a budget that anyone would die for but having watched this series up to episode 6 I'm maddeningly disappointed.The scenes skip from place to place making it difficult to follow the story line whereas in the original series/film the storyline was easier and made sense.I do like that there are subtitles in this series as there were none in the original BUT that was because Richard Chamberlain 'Pilot John Blackthorne' in the original series was made to learn Japanese making it closer to the original book (plus of course the author was on set helping with the script).I'm enjoying the series but anyone who's watched the original will be disappointed as I am given the writers of this series obviously haven't bothered to watch the original to see how the storyline works which is a shame.I look forward to seeing where this series goes and whether it can improve because in my mind the storyline is very difficult to follow unless you've watched the original or read the book by James Clavell written in 1975.",7
"We need to talk about Cosmo Jarvis","Cosmo Jarvis, looking a bit like Tom Hardy, sounding a bit like Jeremy Irons and with a similar acting range as his predecessor, Richard Chamberlain (who delivered a wooden performance in the original Shogun with only three expressions - shocked, angry and confused). I almost stopped watching it bc of his miscasting in the central role. His overacting and voice just grated at every turn. I only binged it bc I was laid up in bed sick for several days.This is an okay adaptation. No great progress from the original, which captivated audiences so much back in the 80s. The raving reviews are somewhat overboard. There was also a complete lack of chemistry between Blackthorne and Mariko, whose 'star crossed lovers' trope added much more to the original. It's an alright version of Clavel's potboiler, but no great shakes.",5
"Bang Average","Has the world been brainwashed? Where are all these 10/10 reviews coming from. It's got to be the U. S. Anyone who is from the UK knows that no one talks like the main character and never has. He is cringeworthy every time he opens his mouth. It's an embarrassment how Americans feel they have to portray English. I promise you- no one sounds like that.The characters are OK'ish- it's not like Game of Thrones were some of the characters are absolutely vile- it's all a bit tepid.The fighting scenes are predictably fake. You know the type- can you 30 bad guys form an orderly queue to kill the one lady with a stick please?It reminds me of a family friendly Disney programme- wait. What? Ah, may be it's aimed at kids then. That would make more sense.",6
"Insulted and scammed out of my time","Atrocious, insulting, offensive to anyone with an above 70 IQ. After wasting 10 + hrs on this travesty we are left with zero resolution. Toranaga sacrifices all his friends for no reason for a ""secret plan"" that never even gets executed. There is NO final battle, you get a 15 sec dream sequence where Toranaga fantasizes about how he would win a fake battle that has not even been fought. And Blackthorne, Toranaga only kept him alive because... HE MADE HIM LAUGH. The entire series has about 30 seconds of collective action, not including the pointless ritual suicides. On top of everything, the entire show is shot on one set, if it was Japan, there was no need for them to even go. The same could have been accomplished on a sound stage. A few horrible overhead CGI shots do not make up for this. The entire show is a waste of time, take this as a warning and save yourself from this insulting drivel.",1
"Poor acting of the lead actor","Considering the high rating of the users, my expectations were high, but still, the series was well made and good. It was an attractive drama. The slow rhythm of the series may has offended some audiences, but this slow rhythm was in perfect harmony with traditional Japanese culture. In fact, the relationship between form and content makes it acceptable. The series had several weaknesses, the most important of which was the choice of actor Anjin(blackthorn). Very poor acting with exaggerated and silly facial expressions and the way he spoke were annoying throughout the ten episodes of the series. In fact, this poor performance by the one of lead actors has given a big blow to the quality of the series.",7
"New is not better","As an old man, who enjoyed the true story, the book, so much I read-it several times during last decades, and as a man who watched the ORIGINAL series, more than 40 years ago, I was deeply disappointed with the ""new"" version.The acting skills are mediocre at best, miserable for most parts, the director took the liberty to ignore the book and started inventing BS, the music is awful, and overall, I cannot stop comparing Richard Chamberlain and. Toshiro Mifune with the pathetic, crappy ""actors"" in this ""new"" version.Annoying to see so much hype from the young generation, for a mediocre, even miserable remake, who throw the real story to the garbage bin, yet get acclaimed with 9 or even 10 stars of 10...
Obvious these peoples never bother to read the book, and for sure, they never watched Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune version - real actors, unlike the pathetic clowns on this production...
CGI effects and ""diversity"" crews will not bring authenticity, nor quality, alone, if it is no talent and no respect for the book who brought this story to the light.I stopped watching after the first episode, so much it hurt my expectations... I will not recommend at all this - the 1980 version is like an old, savvy wine, and this CGI version is like a synthetic , sugar-free, warm can of Coke, who somebody forgot in the sun weeks ago ... .",2
"Great expectations, but fails to live up to the hype","While Shogun impressively captures the essence of medieval Japanese culture with stunning visuals and a talented cast, its pacing falters, particularly in episodes 5-7, which feel like ""snooze-fests"" bogged down by unnecessary plotlines and characters. The action sequences, unfortunately, lack the energy and excitement expected.Mariko emerges as a standout character, showcasing strength and depth, but her backstory remains underdeveloped, leaving her potential untapped. Additionally, pivotal character deaths are glossed over, missing opportunities for emotional resonance and closure.Overall, Shogun falls short of greatness due to its meandering focus, preventing it from fully realizing its promising premise and characters.",7
"This is devoid of intelligence, charm or wit!","For 5 years I have been looking forward to this! The reinvention of a great book and a great tv-series! But it is without charm, without nerve, without credibility! Cosmo and Sawai are boring - and there is no credible romance between them, no chemistry at all. The new plot no longer trails the adventure of John Blackthorne but reduces him to an imaterial sidekick! And why change the books brilliant plot? Why anyone would like this is beyond me! But it will have one obvious consequence: I will unsubscribe Disney + after this - If for no other reason! - it was the final straw! This is not Clavell's Shogun so do not advertise it as such!",1
"A little less conversation, a little more action, please","Series started out strong and absolutely beautiful, but then it is just characters talking and more talking and planning and scheming and talking about setting plans in motion but nothing is shown. It is not epic, just bunch of people talking.Also, what is up with all the suicide. I mean it is so silly after a while. I looked at you wrong: Suicide. I am gonna drown: Suicide. I raised my voice in your house: Suicide. I don't agree with you: Suicide. I mean jeez!!! It was off putting and am quite sure over blown representation.I did like the slow burn romance between Lady Mariko and Anjin-San. But that was that. I was hoping for a big battle scene or something epic which never happened, just talks of it happening. So yeah, 6 stars.",6
"It falls short of both the book as its eighties predecessor","The new series take a lot of liberty in the story telling unlike the book or the original 80s series. As I have read and seen those, I can explain to my spouse and kids what is happening. Although the first episodes did follow the book closely, more and more it deviates on important events. As if the budget would not allow further elaboration. Without me explaining to my family what is happening, I doubt whether they can actually understand what is exactly going on and who is who. Also the bad guys are not so devious as in the book or the original series. The scenes, costumes, sword dueling and so on are very good and give a nice view of feudal Japan. It is a good series to watch but not as epic as the original series. As such I do not understand the very high rating.",3
"A cracker for the starving","To quote Eddie Murphy:
""If you're starving and somebody throw you a cracker you gonna be like this: Goddang, that's the best cracker I ever ate in my life!""Shogun is such a cracker.It's an ok show, but nothing special compared to actually great TV shows.However, we live in a time of DEI-infested garbage entertainment and bad writing, so regular audiences have a hunger for TV shows and movies that at least don't suck.Shogun isn't bad, but it's not great either.Production quality is high and the acting is fine, albeit Cosmo Jarvis comes across as a caricature in the main role.The pacing is slow and it's very hard to get invested in any of the plethora of characters, or the uncompelling plotline. I wouldn't call it boring, but just too much work for too little payoff.While I understand the high rating when compared to what else is out there right now, please don't expect a show that can compete with a pre-woke era show with a 9+ rating.It's a nice cracker, but that's all.",6
"Oh Heck No","I was so excited when I heard about this. I remembered adoring the 1980 version so much that it spurred me to read the novel.But oh my god. No, no, no, a thousands times no.Talk about unfaithful to the novel! $!?!RC was a great Blackthorne! CJ... not so much.The relationship between Mariko and Blackthorne, as written by Clavell - the engine that drives the novel and makes it great - is faithfully represented in the 1980s version but completely bastardized in this dreadful remake. I was heartbroken when Mariko died in the original version; I felt absolutely nothing this time around - which pretty much says it all.Last but not least... the 1980s version was filmed entirely in Japan. The remake? Filmed entirely in... British Columbia. #facepalm.",3
"Underwhelming","On the plus side, the production was top notch with nice costumes and CGI.However, the crux of this series can be summed up with that old favorite phrase from the Seinfeld TV series, ""Yadda Yadda Yadda, Blah Blah Blah"". Not only is the dialog dull, inane, and mostly pointless; it goes on forever and ever, without taking you anywhere (admittedly it is occasionally interrupted by some interesting action sequences). By the tenth episode I was glad that it had ended.Other drawbacks are:The character of Blackthorne. I don't know if it was the actor, director, or script, but this character was dull, boorish, and obnoxious (and he always had this confused, dumb look on his face). This is not something you want in a protagonist.Mariko's character was uninteresting and boring. I did not even feel sad when she met her demise; my reaction was more ""Oh well"" (shrug).",6
"Show Gone With the Wind","In the movie business, you can either confuse the audience about what is happening or make them eager to know where the movie is headed, but you have to answer all these questions or have a strong ending. And this shogun mini-series has both an element of confusion and what's going to happen at the end. And it failed in both of them. It was very slow and boring, with long dialogues. However, I reassure myself that these details will be the key to solving the questions at the end. But the last episode was very disappointing. Instead of depicting what happens to the other characters and portraying the upcoming war, it shows John's dream with his grandchildren or a lot of trivial things instead of what we really expect to see. When I watch a movie, I want to see the conclusion or understand the director's message. However, nowadays, some movies have ambiguous endings, and we often resort to watching multiple clips on YouTube to reveal the true direction of the movie. Dear director, I'm a moviegoer and not Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot to guess what's going on your movie.",1
"Stunning cinematography, taut direction, poor story telling","James Clavell was one of the most remarkable writers of his time. Not only did he himself live an incredible life, he wrote extraordinary stories with an unbelievable range of topic and mood, everything from horror to adventure to crime. His screenplays included The Fly, The Great Escape, and To Sir with Love. (His politics, however, were unfortunate, being a rightwing libertarian. No one is perfect.)The reason he could do all this is that the art of excellent narration was second nature to him; he was born a natural story teller. Unfortunately, this adaption of his best selling novel leaves the clear, lucid narration behind. Admittedly, Clavell had more room in his novel that this series has, but the people behind this show, rather than emulate Clavell's genius, have opted for a confusing script that is hard to follow and sometimes seems to meander off into oblivion. A shame, as everything else is here: great direction, superb acting, and above all, extraordinarily luscious sets filmed with precision and clarity: everything the script somehow avoids.",6
"Feudal Canada","This is one show which would've benefited by being shot on location. The unmistakable evergreen forests of Canada immediately breaks a sense of immersion.The story feels low stakes, with boring subplots and meandering political machinations. Two ridiculous scenes in the pilot would give Tarantino an orgasm. A group of Japanese soldiers are almost overcome by a starving, weak pirate and in the same scene one of the said soldier has his sword taken from him by one of the weakened pirates. They had diversity behind the camera but still played the Western fantasy of overcoming Eastern might with ease.The show will probably do gangbuster numbers for the first few episodes but interest will fall if they don't pick up the slack. The characters at this stage are too thin, especially the Japanese who come across as one-dimensional and, in some cases, caricatures.",4
"If you expect S2 you're at the wrong place","I'm not familiar with the original book the show is based on, but after watching the final episode, there was one word that came to my mind: Seinfeld. Or as people call ""the show about nothing"".The reason why is because the title of the show ""Shogun"", doesn't exist in the story. Yes we get a 1 minute sneak peek about Toranaga's intentions, but it's just a plan, a dream. And of course the whole show is about making him the Shogun because the other side is evil, but in order to achieve his goals he sacrifices literally everyone around him.He's not better, actually worse because he doesn't attack his enemies, he just kills off his allies. And of course you won't see any of plotting, the plans, because the story focuses on others, whose lives actually less important than his. The story that would be interesting happens off screen of after the show, that we will never see.It's a huge disappointment, and I'm not saying that because I wanted more action, I just wanted a good story where things happen on screen. Otherwise I could just go and watch Seinfeld.",6
"Insanely Boring.","I struggled with this. The largest problem in my view is there are just tons of scenes that are boring and really don't have a pay off and or are poorly explained. Such as the Pheasant scene. I had to go to you tube to understand what that was about. The first episode I felt like I had to watch it again because nothing really happened but, no, nothing really happened. That happens a lot.As to the alleged quality... one word..Cosmo Jarvis. He was as bad here as everything I have seen him in. Playing it very odd like he has tics and was not exactly someone I was rooting for. I also didn't believe that he and the main woman character would ever get together because of the time and culture differences.The entire story was meant to be one of those where the main character wins by outsmarting others but that can only be taken so far. The idea that this guy prevailed because he anticipated all of the various things that had to happen in 10 episodes (including an earthquake) is insanity.",1
"A huge build up to a battle we don't see .","Sorry loved the show and the build up but wasn't it all a build up to show the famous battle was I the only one expecting to experience the great battle ,which if you read up on the actual battle would of been a great ending to the story a chess match no one expected with sides changing in the middle of the actual battle but just tell you a little bit of what would actually happen at the battle .Felt a little short changed at the end ,was like watching Napoleon and at the end they skip the battle ...On a plus side thought the acting was excellent but shame we didn't get to see the master plan actually unfold.",6
"LOOSELY based on the book","I've read many of the 10/10, 9/10 reviews, and I beg to differ. While the visuals are strong, the changes made to the book's story are not an improvement on the book. This version makes it hard for me to follow the story, and this telling sheds little light on the vast cultural differences between Japan & Europe that the book and 1980 version capture so well.The actor playing Blackthorne seems like a caricature. It's hard to imagine someone like him actually being accepted into the Japanese fold. The actor playing the Portuguese pilot doesn't work, as well as the actor who played the 1st priest Blackthorne encounters. I was hoping for a much more insightful take on the story, 40 some years after the 1st production, with the technology and cultural discernment available these days.",3
"With all due respect","This reboot is not as good as the original which is one of my favorite tv shows of all time. Despite enjoying the Japanese spoken (I speak it), the characters are not as compelling as the original. They seem to be one dimensional in comparison. Also, the script and storyline is much more haphazard. I can only assume the producers and writers thought this would be a more interesting and complex format. Instead, I feel the actors lack direction and often seem to just be reading the lines as best they can. My main concern though is the lack of character exploration which I feel the original series did in a much better fashion. Seeing Blackthorne become Anjin was a much more fulfilling experience in the original series for example. Still, compared to the typical dribble out there, it's decent.",7
"Sadly... it's mostly about authentic costumes","I had great hopes. I've watched Mr. Sanada acting in different movies and I admire his work. His performance in this one is very good, not his best in my opinion, but very good.Costumes are very nice too. I cannot speak about their authenticity though I don't remember seeing any obi on almost any female character. Not on this remake. I've seen it on all female characters on the 1980 original version.There aren't other good things I can write about it.I read this remake was well received and rated in Japan, compared with the original version which was not. I'm not Japanese and although I watched a lot of Japanese movies, not only the ones made for western viewers, and I read a lot about Japan and its culture, I think this version was made to target both, the eastern and western audiences. The team probably worked hard to do that and I think it shows. While the original version is somewhat cheesy, this one lacks almost any sentiment. It's like the Japanese part of the team had an argument with the western team every time they may have tried to do something to bring any soul to the story. I felt a tension throughout the whole series. It felt restrained and cold. I believe that may have been the intention, more so since they filmed it on rainy, cold, and dark days.The screenplay misses key points from the book, and most of the ones they didn't miss are minimized. I know, it's based on James Clavell's book, not quite loosely, but still, not what the author intended. That is sometimes not bad, that is when the book is not that great, just the idea behind it is. It's not the case with this novel. I don't expect for a team to follow the book exactly, but at least do an acceptable job, if they cannot do better. There really cases in which the movie is better than the book. Not in this case.I think Clavell knew a lot about Japan and its culture. To this point he writes about kissing which is not the way a samurai male or female was showing affection to his/her spouse or lover. In this movie the Blackthorne kissing Mariko scene is a fail. There are ways actors can show love even without touching, but I haven't seen any such scene in this new series. Almost all seppuku scenes in the movie are empty compared to the way they are portrayed in the novel. There is at least one which is better represented in the movie but which is not in the book. Toda Hiromatsu is never committing seppuku but the scene in the movie is very good.The screenplays for different episodes are written by different people and directed by different directors. This is why the whole story is missing unity. It's almost like threads that barely connect.I watched all episodes, some even twice. Overall it's not that bad but for me it was disappointing. I did not enjoy the original much at the time I've seen it in 1980. Not because I read the book previously. Even so, I like it better than this new one. I would not call this new one a remake.",3
"Nice enough, but better read the books.","A good show - good casting, good acting, nice decors, but very, very rushed. In just 4 episodes they cover half of the books, and don't really show how the main character experiences the cultural shock and how he comes to change his views of Japan's culture, and how he comes to understand and accept the culture and customs, it's people and how he adapts to his new life in Japan.If you haven't read the books, you'll probably be thrilled by the show. But if you have read the books - you might be disappointed by how rushed it is the show.I'm giving it a 7.5 (though I'm rounding it down to compensate for all the 10 - who are exaggerated).",7
"Compared to the 80s version, this has no heart....","I remember watching the 80s version of this series back in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s and it had a good story, decent action, and it seemed to keep you wondering and looking forward to the acting.This new version....it's just so bland, so ""default"", doesn't seem to have actors with any heart or spirit. It's like they just got up there and read their parts, cashed their checks, and went home.I mean Joh Rhys-Davies MADE the 1980 show as well as Richard Chamberlain. Together they were dynamic. And the asian actors seemed to have personalities you really wanted to follow.This show, they justy don't have any really impressive spirit to their characters.Others may not agree but i just don't see it in this version...",5
"GREAT SHOW WITH A WEAK ENEDING","So i loved the show, the intencity of scenes and the dialogue was not hard to follow with subtitles. But I just cant rate this any higher, I do love unusual endings in shows and movies, endings that you expect the least but it felt speedrun and skipped. I Awaited an big battle with army vs army to conclude the fight between the clans and that blackthorne would have some part to ensure victoyr for lord toranaga but instead lord toranaga just reveald his plans in the near end of his show and we just have to sit there and imagine he wins the battle. It would have been fun to atleast see a smal part of the battle and atleast get a glimpse of vicory on lord toranaga's side but instead we see the armies in a future timejump as lord toranaga explains his plans and then it cuts back to the present. I know this is how the book end (i have not read it) but atleast a part of the battle could have been fun to see. But for the show overall I can comfortly rate it a 9/10 as i do like these kind of shows (slow drama) because of how intense some scenes can be as it leads up to something big and you can feel it coming slowly witch builds up an satisfying intensity. Great actors great visuals and good to watch if you like history and japan culture :D.",7
"Decent but highly overrated","The show just is about average, leaning high or low depending on my mood. Firstly, the English actor playing John Blackthorne is just cringe-worthy. Has a toyish look on his face in every other scene, going on similarly cartoonish monologues at every opportunity. The best actors were by far the ones playing Lord Toranaga and Yabushige but they too were not perfect. Well of course, perfection is hard to attain but why is the show talked about like it's perfect then? It was far from it. I guess it has the value of novelty for somebody unacquainted with Japanese culture, and something for those with a fetish for interracial romance, but the script while gripping at times was let down because of the over-focus on the English character and his fetishized romance with the suicidal Japanese lady. I think the show would have been far better as a full-on purely Japanese historical drama on the Shogunate. But I suppose having a token white guy who gets naughty with a high-born Japanese woman makes it a lot more alluring to western audiences.",5
"Overhyped but still pretty good","Based on the early reviews I was expecting a LOT from this series. While it was certainly watchable, I don't think it lived up the hype.First of all, the acting was uneven - Cosmo Jarvis for starters who is likable enough but not particularly believable. Generally the Regents and Toronaga were also pretty wooden. The female cast definitely outperformed the men though I did enjoy Yabushige.While there some beautiful scenes, I also thought the cinematography was rather dark and murky too often - the scenes on the water especially were often hard to make out.And where were the battles? The show was promoted as a war drama - there were a few fights and skirmishes, but other than in the credits there weren't any real battle scenes.",7
"Over rated big time","Being a show done in English yet majority of it being in Japanese with needing to read subtitles already lost me I feel I can't really follow a show if I'm constantly reading subtitles so this just felt like I was watching some foreign movie on Netflix without having a dubbed option.I really should have just dropped it after the first few episodes, as it was just boring to me hardly anything happens. I managed to sit through the whole season though thinking it might get better well it does not, there is only a few action scenes in each episode and the rest as I already said is just reading subtitles as the dialogue is in Japanese. I don't see the hype at all with all episodes having an average rating of 8+, and it being renewed for another two seasons. Totally over rated.",3
"Overhyped","The first couple episodes are interesting, the more the show goes on the more boring it becomes. I had to fast forward almost every dialogue through episodes 5-7, at least half the screentime in these episodes was dedicated to drama between Blackthorne and Mariko which is the most dull and tiresome part of the whole film.The whole political power struggle can be interesting but sadly it's not flashed out enough, and then again, the show just tumbles down into weird family drama instead of continuing with the scheming councilours and profit-seeking Portugese. Even though the scheming we are shown also has some flaws, some events/plot twists don't make sense and even made me laugh.There is VERY little action in the show, almost none of it. There is still hope for the episodes to come, but as for episodes 1-7 there is basically 1-2 fighting scenes... in a show about feudal Japan and the samurai.As for the technical part,
the costumes, scenery, athmosphere and VFX overall are good. Almost all dialogues are on Japanese with English subtitles, and it can be a little off-putting after a while, even though it is somewhat understandable because we are shown a dispute between the Western European and Japanese cultures.The acting in the film is decent, not horrible but not a masterpiece either.Overall, the show (so far) is mediocre at best, and feels like a lot of wasted potential. There are some cool scenes, ideas and characters, but it is definitely not the 10/10 show as many proclaim.",4
"Spin out the story version","I read the book years ago and I enjoyed the Richard Chamberlain /Mifune series.Came across the Disney offering with great anticipation and began watching episode 1. My initial thoughts:Yes it's lavish and looks good, but (the big BUT)The story telling is poor and unnecessarily long winded (presumably to milk the story for the longest possible time)The central character Blackthorne, with his 'put on' English 'Dick Van Dyke' cor blimey Mary Poppins accent, I found intensely irritating (being English) and this detracts from the story in addition to the tediously slow storyThe Japanese actors with subtitles, all look good and play their parts but it's just too 'talky talky talky' that is frankly boring.Not a patch on the Mifune/Chamberlain version, which used a bit of narration to explain context and set the background.Yet another streaming series designed to milk a story to death (and thereby ruin it) 6.5/10 for the first episode .Doubt i will bother watching much further.Update
I did watch the whole series and it was much the same.Unnecesarily long and drawn out. Not a patch on the book or the Chamberlain/Mifune series. Reminded me of game of thrones - how the original part was told by a master story teller (Martin) then the ending written by 2 clowns . Similar thing here, they took a good story and ruined it. Shame.",6
"The biggest waste of 10-plus hours of my life ever!","Almost 90% of this 10-plus hour series was just boring melodramatics and lame nonsense proverbs. Even if you condensed just the best and pertinent parts from all ten episodes, you'd still barely have an enjoyable and fulfilling movie. There would still be more plot holes than bad haircuts and lame dialogue combined.Then to make matters worse, they finish the series off ""explaining"" how the battle was won, instead of showing anything. No big battle, nothing. I was waiting the entire series to see this big revenge war, and all I get is this anticlimactic speech. So in other words, there' too much blah blah, many beautiful scenes that offer zero to little plot advancement, and tons of useless half-explained backstories that added nothing but melodramatics to the already going-nowhere story.I'm baffled how this series is rated so high. Never mind all the fake 10/10 new account reviews, but even on RT - 99% by the critics?! Like seriously, are they that bored and easily amused and have that much time to waste with no reward for the viewers investment? By far this is the most boring, waste of budget and overrated series I have ever seen, and I've seen many flops. It's a very generous 1/10 all going to production values, and some decent cinematography - with the exception of the overly dark/night scenes, where I guess they couldn't find power outlets to plug some set lights on.",1
"Disappointing to Book Readers & 1980","What the 1980 Version has the 2024 doesn't:
* actually filmed in Japan
* actual love story in the book
* better themed music (tho action music wonky)
* follows the book
* has contrast of great sunlight vs rain
* more screen time for crew & Christian enemies
* paced, immersive bc it takes its timeBoth have many Japanese actors, nothing new in 2024 version. The 2024 guts the boom, ignores strong side arcs, some main characters don't have screen charisma. Being shot in British Columbia, it's almost always overcast, foggy, rainy. Very unlike Japan. They pushed ""authenticity"" and blew it with location, not following the boom, making up scenes not in the book like they knew better, it's a decent watch but overall total failure to bring passion, adventure, variety of entertainment the 1980 version slays at.The book is best of course. Read that first.My lasting impression of the 2024 version is I never saw any real sunny shots. Shame. All seemed like a Pall over the film.",6
"Edited. Reduced Rating due to Episode 10","After watching Episode 10, I reduced the rating from 7 to 3. Why? Because the finale is just bad, so bad that it made me feel cheated. You have 9 episodes of build up, multiple scenes of large armies, all this talk about ""war war war"" and... nothing, not even a small flashback.When the finale began with a glimpse of an elderly anjin, I thought this would be a good flashback to the battle of Sekigahara. But it didn't capitalize. In fact, there was no reason to even bother with the elderly anjin.And what is the ultimately let down is that they didn't even follow the book. The show is called Shogun and they didn't bother to show you the ending in which he became shogun or show you what happened to Ishido. These were all in the book.Either they ran out of budget or for whatever reason, the finale seemed rushed and just overall one of the worst episodes ever and definitely one of the worse finales ever.-----------------With such high rating, you can be sure every review out there will tell you all the same positive things about this series that I can tell you. It is filmed crisp and beautifully with the newest technology and a very high budget production. The dialog is smart, deep, often with philosophy as well as wisdom. The actors are top notch and fit the realism and seriousness of the tone.But what many may have overlooked, especially the western audience, is just how ""comic book"" and cliche they portrayed ancient Japan. The one scene that completely throw me off the suspension of disbelief came early in episode 1 when a random NPC walked up to the prisoner aijin and asked a few questions. The ""leader"" of the village then just out of the blue decapitated him in front of the public.I get they're trying to portray an ancient Japan that was brutal, but that scene was so comical because of how out of touch it was with reality. For a better representation of how ancient Japan was, I recommend Yoji Yamada's famous samurai trilogy - The Twilight Samurai, The Devil's Claw, and Love & Honor. Even ""When the Last Sword was Drawn"" was more accurate and realistic in their presentation.The error in Shogun's portrayal comes from the fact the book was written by a westerner. It almost, I would say, demonized Japanese as if they were completely inhumane. This theme would progress into further episodes. Again, perhaps it is just how the westerners view the culture from their lenses.In Yoji Yamada's trilogy, it demonstrate that despite the culture, despite the code of the samurai, that they were still human, they still feared death and valued family, marriage, etc... In the movie ""Hari Kari - Death of a Samurai"" it showed how the most proud and arrogant samurai feared death and would hide themselves when their top knot was removed in order to wait for it to grow back than commit seppuku.For this, I would put Shogun at a 7/10. It is entertaining and it has a lot of great qualities. But for this one shortcoming, it just makes it really hard to take it seriously despite much of the element is actually based on a true story.",3
"Not worth","Not worth at all, very overrated and waste of time !People are praising only and only for production sets their detail and acting of cast but main ingredient story is weakThey have mocked loyal and honest peoplePlot: whoever is loyal and honest : go and commit suicide while dumb lord chills in hot springsAnd not so important characters : you all are booked for next season
Cheers !Time line GOT 1-6 first few episodes later episodes GOT last seasonsSets and production details very good but overall hollow without gripping storyMain male character is pointless at end of story
Japanese actors are good but plot narration gets poor and poor with episodes even story could have been written way better.",5
"A Samurai Sword Swing & a Miss","I can tolerate slow TV shows just fine if they engulf me in story, good acting, production, etc. At the end of this show, it just left me with so many questions; like: ""Why was the story even told?"". ""So the impact of the Catholics/Protestants really didn't matter in this story?"". ""Japan was really this depressing of a place? Nothing to look forward to but death?"". Then there's all the ridiculous antics of Blackthorne. So he's a Protestant who is upset at these ""savage Catholics"" that are engaging in free market capitalism. Nevertheless the guy acts like his Protestant faith is superior to the Catholics. Yet he's the most vile, evil, and dishonest person, coming into Japan. He basically has no faith at all. Yet he's risking his life for this ""faith""? It's just such an absurd plot point. It's so hard to overcome that throughout the first several episodes. You can't help but roll your eyes. Then the show just continues on this incredibly slow-burn of a pace. Especially at the end. I'm just grateful they didn't do this for 6+ season like the majority of other modern TV shows to make it into a cash cow. In the end, the show committed seppuku after one season and I would gladly 2nd it out of respect, with a sword in hand.Now for a few Positives:
Good wardrobes/Costumes
Good acting by the ""Japanese"" actors.Nice cinematic shots.",6
"Bizarre waste of money and talent","What a mess. The main feeling I got from it was nihilism, darkness, and despair. Lots of pointless cruelty and violence including torture.I am getting it an extra star because the visuals are incredible. The people responsible for the costumes, sets, photography, etc. All did a great job. Production value-wise, it's as good as it gets. And I don't fault the actors either. But it's such a shallow film beneath the pretty surface.It feels like a mob film, where everyone is the bad guy and all the cultures are portrayed disrespectfully. It's a caricature of the time period. A documentary would have been 10x more interesting and satisfying.",2
"Looks like a video game","So I've watched the first two episodes and it's pretty good. Lots of interesting stuff is happening and the story is building nicely.There is decent acting, lots of plotting (GOTesq) and I'm sure I will watch the whole series.BUT... what is going on with the sets/location? I know they are not real, it's 17th century Japan. But they look so fake. They have that over lit perfectness you see in video games. Plus stuff in the background of scenes is in focus, like whoever created them hadn't heard of depth of field.There is a scene towards the end of E2 with two characters in the foreground that are in focus and a building that must be several miles away is also in focus...weird.Then in other scenes they have purposefully blurred parts of the actors bodies, such as feet or hands, obviously done in post to add fake DOF.Anyway, if you can ignore all that, it's pretty decent.",7
"Audience Left in the Dark","There are some good moments in Shogun, but the big problem is the audience is largely left in the dark as to what is happening.So many times, important characters and minor characters make plans outside the view of the audience.Toranaga's scheming vassal is working both sides, but we never see him doing it. He just tells us when talking with his nephew. Particularly egregious is when he agrees to further Izo's plan in the palace, but we are left out of the discussion only to witness the act.The gardener's plan to take down the pheasant and be framed as the spy. Again, we just find out about it all later, we don't see it happening, agonize, feel the pain, the loyalty to his lord.Buntaro's survival. He fights through the countryside with a band of Ronin and returns to Lord Toranaga. Sounds like a fantastic side-story? Too bad we don't see any of it.Son attacks uncle in brothel. It'd have been nice to see the plan formulated, knowing it was a bad idea, build some tension maybe? No, just happens.Toranaga's final plan? We know nothing.I just never found myself immersed because the writers chose to leave me in the dark.The acting is spotty, Cosmo Jarvis and Anna Sawai are bland and boring. Their romance is cold. Everyone else is pretty good with particular applause for Moeka Hoshi who plays Blackthorn's consort. She's fantastic, steals all her scenes, expressive, haunted.Sets are lovely although backgrounds are not great, CGIsh.I want to be immersed, part of the show, involved. I wasn't and it left me apathetic.",5
"I personally did not like the series","Now, Shogun's story is also based on James Clavel's epic novel during the transitional period between the feudal and Edo regimes and the events before the actual battle of Sekigahara in 1600. They are based on real historical characters. If we want to compare this ten-episode mini-series to another work, we should say that the Shogun series is in many ways the Japanese version of Game of Thrones, although without the dragons and dark fantasy elements present in This story may at first present itself as the heroic John Blackthorne of Cosmo Jarvis in Japan, but it soon becomes clear that Blackthorne, alias Anjin-sama, is merely an overseer of a game of thrones led by Lord Yoshi Toranaga Hiroyuki Sanada and His rival Lord Ishido Kazunari is performed.",6
"Very dissapointing","There's not much to say about this show other than that the 9/10 review can only be seen as a joke.There are a couple of great episodes, the first two in fact. The show just collapses after that. Nothing really happens. There is no plot. No character development. The dialogues don't lead anywhere or have any purpose. Shogun isn't good as a character drama, or a pseudo-historical epic or even a soap opera.Even from a visual perspective it's dull and grey, and the camera has a weird blur and depth of field that's overdone.When all's said and done this show is just extremely unmemorable and badly made.",2
"Wildly inaccurate","Fruit of the poison tree. Early in we see John Blackthorn with a flintlock pistol. However, this series is supposed to be set in 1600. The pistol keeps on reappearing and being used with Blackthorn reloading and firing in a few seconds However, such pistols did not appear until nearly a century later and took a minimum of 15 seconds to reload. One a film or a series makes such a bad mistake, then you have to doubt the accuracy of everything. There are many other inaccuracies particularly in portraying 17th century Japanese culture and it is a long list .On the plus side, wonderful sets, locations, filming and acting but pure hokum.",6
"What a bore!","Shogun series is like a Soda bottle.When you open a soda bottle you see, lots of fizz, hissing noises, promise of great thirst quenching flavours. But........keep it aside for a few minutes and, the fizz dies down, flavours ebb and taste becomes flat!That is exactly how Shogun is!1st 2 episodes....... Great!Then it flattens out.Sooooo boring ! Can't gulp it down, can't spit it out. You have to watch it force fully, forwarding it by 10-10 seconds. Hoping it will end soon. Hoping something interesting will happen! What a fool !I've not read the novel, maybe it came out after I was born! Check out the Blue eye Samurai! Although it's an Anime but, much much better.",5
"From Samurai to Sorry-murai: A Cinematic Sacrilege!","Given the excellent episodic series we have seen on TV in recent years, I expected a modern, respectful adaptation of the incredible story of 'Shogun.'Sadly, the result is extremely disappointing. Toranaga is a shadow of his former self, Mariko is nothing like the original character and is downright unbelievable, and Blackthorn has been so diminished that he could almost be removed from the storyline entirely.The incredibly rich and complex story imagined by Clavell has been violated and distorted beyond recognition, but for what exactly? This series can be grouped with 'The Rings of Power' for a futile, pointless distortion of the original storyline, where only the title and the names of the characters remain, not their personalities.Mariko is inconsistent. Initially, she is outright hostile to Blackthorne, for no apparent reason and in conflict with the tasks required by her leader, Toranaga. Then, she shows some friendliness, only to become irate again, and she speaks to her superiors in a manner that would have been unthinkable during the Japanese feudal era. Granted, if Japan is highly sexist today, it was extremely harsh for women back then. Nevertheless, if you are making a period piece, accuracy is required. The show's writers not only completely disrespect the original story but also any semblance of historical accuracy.The offense continues with Lady Ochiba taking control of the Council of Regents (not in the story) simply because she asked for it. This utter nonsense, which would never have happened, of course, fits the political agenda of showcasing strong female characters to satisfy modern sensibilities. It's a pure political manifesto, overriding truth, historical accuracy, and storyline-no more, no less than Soviet propaganda in post-revolution Russia.The violation continues with the portrayal of Toranaga as a leader who openly states his thoughts, a complete reversal from the actual character. There's barely any trace of the real Toranaga, his military and political genius, or the majesty that Toshiro Mifune so perfectly embodied in the excellent 1980s series.Father Alvito and all the plots involving the Portuguese priests are almost gone, though they were integral to the story. Losing these elements means losing the Hitchcockian aspects of the thriller that ran parallel to the story of Blackthorne learning to understand Japanese culture. These parallel stories of intrigue and political interference are what made the book and the 1980s TV series so satisfying. It seems the creators of the messy 2024 pastiche have little trust in the audience's ability to follow that storyline. To them, I suggest watching the otherwise fantastic 'Ripley.'The costumes are lavish and the cinematography is adequate, although it suffers from the current trend of making many scenes dull, grey, and uninspiring, all based on the misguided concept of 'realism' aided by the artificiality of digital cameras. It's acceptable but not noteworthy.There are many other issues, but mentioning them all would make this review overly lengthy. The verdict is: stay away, read the book instead, or watch the 1980s series with Chamberlain and Mifune.",2
"Good series but can anything do real justice to the book?","Ah, 1152 pages of an intricate story is very hard to approach. Ten hour-long episodes cannot really capture what made the book so great but I give them credit for trying.I'm not sure a lot was gained by making so much of the dialog in Japanese. I'm sure that went over well in Japan but the majority of their audience was surely in English speaking countries and that just turns off a lot of viewers.The heart of the book was the love story between Blackthorne and Mariko and that is not found in this series at all. I sensed zero chemistry between the actors and we never really saw much to justify their attraction to each other.I'm sure the showrunners had their reasons to depart from the book as much as they did but I didn't care for doing that. If you had not read the book I am unsure you would really understand this story from the series. However I hope it will inspire people to go and read this magnificent work of historical fiction.",7
"Unecessarily sexualized content","I only watched 4 episodes until i quit entirely.The show was alright, and even quite nice sometimes.But they had to put these useless sex scenes that don't add anything to the story.I am sorry but one scene for the first episode alright i get it but then episode 4 starts 2 more sex scenes.It's even about being prude, it's just it doesn't bring anything that cannot be brought implicitly. It's intellectually insulting, this is why the notation was so harsh. Instantly lost all interest.I get that Japanese have this weird thing with sex but i do not wish to further my interest in the show or their culture. I'm sure some people adore this show and Japanese culture. Suit yourself.I didn't even finished the 4th episode, i said i'm done.",1
"Poorly cast, spurns the beauty of Japan.","This show came with a lot of hype, and nowadays everybody on social media is basically shilling for somebody. A show doesn't even have to be good to earn a second season, it just has to bring in enough viewers to merit a second, and the number of viewers doesn't hinge on the quality of the show, just how well it was marketed. I watched it because Sanada has a lead role and I fell for the hype.So the show has good marketing, good enough to raise expectations, but alas Shogun fails to match its hype. This is has the distinct feel of a tv show, and some of the dialogue is a bit simplistic. What really threw me was laziness that infests the show. We have Japanese actors speaking Japanese, but everyone is speaking Portuguese in English. Incredibly silly choice that completely degrades the seriousness of the show. It's a fact that the Portuguese tried to colonise Japan, so why hide from the epic scale that multiple languages would have given the show?Some of the casting gave this a Xena warrior princess feel. Perhaps it should have had a bigger budget or been made as a movie? Theres not much going on in terms of plot, and the weekly release schedule just doesn't work in today's day and age. There's just no way to remember what happened over the previous episodes if one takes a month's break.The British protestant captain is poorly cast and the acting bordering on pantomime.Japan is a stunningly beautiful county, and I think they really missed a trick with the cinematography. Nearly all the shots fail to immerse, looking like they have shot this distinctly TVesque show in a studio somewhere, rather than on location.As an aside, I'm very skeptical of reviews that rate 10 on the basis of a few episodes.",5
"Disappointed","The acting in this show is the best thing about it. However, the lack of character development is a major issue. The plot also lacks clarity, as the story seems to keep cycling through the same events in slow process just to make the episode timing longer. The show started off well but then it started to loose my interest, leaving me feeling detached from the storyline.One of the reason is the main character, Toranaga. Despite being positioned as the lead character he isn't particularly any better than the rest of them as he make his loyal people die without second thoughts being as selfish.Overall, while the acting performance is strong, the show could be much better hopefully in season 2.",6
"Based On, Shogun. Not an adaptation.","A bit disappointed.I sense this has been made with a touch of fear & a lack of respect for the original story. And as such it is simply based on the book & not an adaptation.But as a stand alone effort, it's okay.When I write, made with fear, this is what I mean:The brutality of the Samurai Japanese way of life has been powder-puffed over.But that way of life, the ying & yang of brutality & beauty is essential to the story & what makes feudal Japan so fascinating. The Book is packed with this juxtaposition as is the 1980 miniseries. It is so essential to the story.The casting of John Blackthorn is also disappointing. Blackthorn is a big/tall, 6ft+ northern European man. Packing power in all physical places.The casting of this sub 6ft, blue contact wearing actor, doing a Richard Burton impression, is questionable. But he does okay.Shogun, is supposed to be the story of John Blackthorn, set in the world of feudal Japan. His journey through that world & his relationship with that world's puppet master as seen through both men's eyes.This miniseries almost makes Blackthorn irrelevant in his own story.This story, at times, is also unnecessary crass which undermines a pivot that Shogun revolves around. I repeat, unnecessarily crass & unauthentic. They have got Mariko wrong & the brush of girl power plays unauthentic & silly.I don't know if budget or bad choices led to important parts being cut, either way, it doesn't help.This miniseries as a stand alone, is not bad. It's just not an authentic, Shogun.",5
"It's not awful but it's far from enjoyable","I'll lay my cards on the table here in that I was a fan from my childhood of the original. I'd expected this to be even better. And whilst it starts off being a faithful remake of the original, it soon descends into something less enjoyable.The original focused exclusively on John Blackthorns's viewpoint becoming immersed in a foreign alien culture and becoming gradually absorbed by it. This one does also but to a lesser degree. About 75% of the show is looking at the feuding between the various clans. And I dispose that's about right because after all the show is called Shogun and not John Blackthorne' Adventures in Japan.But this creates a pretty significant problem - for me at least. 95% of the show is subtitled. So you spend most of the time reading the subtitles and not the characters. Now normally I don't have a problem with subtitles for foreign films but for this I do.Then there's the lighting. Why are so many scenes set in such poorly lit indoor settings? And they're not restricted to just indoors.Then there's the weather. Does it never stop raining in Japan? Living in Ireland I've cursed our foul damp weather my whole life but we're effectively Saharan compared to these poor souls.Finally, there's the whole ""They all look the same"" problem. Now don't jump down my throat with this one. But the fact is that to Caucasians, who also all look the same to other ethnicities, trying to determine which character is which is so difficult especilaly when the lighting is so poor. Other filmmakers get around this by using different hair colour or style for each character to differentiate them one from another. Or dress them differently consistently. But with these characters, where the blokes all sport the same partial baldy hair and the same outfits, you spend so much time confused as to who is who. And since there are so many extras all looking the same, I found myself watching an extra thinking it was a lead character and vice versa. Maybe that's just a problem for an old timer like me.I think the only time the outfit colour is implemented is with John's love-interest. She's generally sporting a pale blue outfit. Dear love you if she ever wishes to experiment with different outfit choices.So, is it an easy watch? No. You have to seriously invest your time into persevering with the show past the first two episodes. In fact there's one episode around the middle of the show that I think the filmmakers had a chuckle putting it in. We're treated to a traditional Japanese play and ""musical performance"" with accompanying dancers. And it goes on forever with little relevance or benefit to the plot.It certainly has many good points but I think it's very overrated. I was close to choosing Seppuku myself.",7
"Meh starts off cook","It starts off really epic. The first episodereally draws you in, and the action was amazing and gory. And then about 2 episodes in it slows way down.And then it it becomes about how two of the main characters like one another but can't be together, and then her husband comes back and it's an awkward love triangle. If they had stuck to the action and the court intrigue, it would've been a thousand times better. But, they had to appeal to a larger audience I guess and it became a love story. Also, I highly suggest watching it in it's native language because it's much better than the dubbing. But, such is always the case.",3
"Good show ruined with an unsatisfactory conclusion","I liked this show I liked the acting and storytelling the only thing I disliked was the medicore ending its so abrupt and unsatisfying it leaves you saying wait thats it so there's no resolution whatsoever we see blackthorn a frail old man in bed so we know he got out of Japan but honestly not seeing the battle between the 2 armies was a let down I think they didn't show it because they ran out of money honestly the ending makes watching this a waste of time hollywood doesn't have a clue how to end a series proper I mean the way it was told that this would be ishidos fate was so flat and uninteresting I would not recommend you watch this.",6
"Weak, and nowhere near as brilliant as the 1980 miniseries","Firstly, the writing is all over the place and this is affecting the overall narrative which staggers and stumbles from one scene to the next.There is no pacing whatsoever, no flow to the story. It's as if somebody chopped semi-random parts from the book and filmed them.Not sure why some people are rating it so highly, I naturally realise that tastes differ but what is so appealing about this mess of an adaptation? For me at least there's just nothing to like. The acting is often weak, the casting for the main characters is mostly poor and why is everything so dull and gloomy? Of course, it was filmed in Canada ......Now compare and contrast to the 1980 miniseries - fantastic flow to the story, pretty much perfect casting and it also looks great, you can actually SEE the scenery, the buildings, the characters. AND it was all filmed in Japan.Of course, thanks to the power of the media this new adaptation will get a lot of accolades, but it really doesn't deserve them.I was looking forward to this but I'm extremely disappointed.",2
"Not the book","Visual translations of a work of fiction always problematic. But this version of Shogun alters too much of the original.Kudos for trying to depict the intrigues and manipulations of the Japanese nobility during this critical period in their history. The expansion of that material may help contemporary audiences.Blackthorne more of an enigma than in the novel. Yes, he finds himself in a totally alien culture. How he comes to understand it is a huge part of the story. But inventing certain characters' traits to shortcut that realization lessens his importance in the story.No need to invent material in a book that showed all the forces at work so compellingly.",7
"Profoundly boring","I'm really scratching my head as to why this show is so highly rated. I assume it's getting praise from people who like costumes and set design more than anything else, because Shogun has nothing more to offer. Sure, it looks nice, but it is so slow paced and all of the story is told through dialogue - that's not television! Even if there was better visual storytelling and pacing, the story is still incredibly boring. I just don't understand what is supposed to be the hook that helps to answer the vital question: ""why should I care?"". I find it absolutely impossible to care about any of the characters or what they are trying to achieve. I miss when TV was engaging.",2
"Incredible performances and production, but confusing","I found Shogun to be a frustrating watch. The performances and production were uniformly outstanding across the entire show. It gripped me from episode 1, and I thoroughly enjoyed what it was trying to do. However, by the end I was left with far too many questions about the main plot. Some of this is intentional- Toronaga's plot is convoluted, and the main character is arguably Mariko rather than Blackthorne. However, there is enough that is left unresolved in my opinion that I had a hard time accepting that episode 10 was the finale.So, in broad strokes, Toronaga's plan clearly works. Mariko's story is completed in a way that I could follow. The things I couldn't figure out were:1) How did Ochiba really fit into this. I know the show went through some of the story, but it was so subtle that I could not fully understand her turns. From reading commentary on the book, it feels like the show left out some details on her relationships with both Mariko and Toronaga, and with Taiko. She seems to be pulling all of the strings, but those strings are certainly not clear.2) In episode 10, what were the scenes of Blackthorne as an old man meant to convey? He is shown almost seeing the history as a flashback from England, with a rosary that I presume is meant to be Mariko's... but then we learn that he gives it to the sea in remembrance, and there is every hint that Toronaga never lets him leave Japan.... so why these scenes? Are they dreams he is having in the moment of an old age he will never see? I just didn't get it.3) It is heavily implied at the end that not all of the story was actually Toronaga's plotting, and moreso that he was simply supremely effective at making use of the events that transpired. I think this is the easiest of my concerns to rectify as it shows him more as amazingly adaptive than particularly plotting, which is a very zen move. Still, and perhaps I am not appreciating the subtlety enough, I found it a bit frustrating. The mystery left hanging is perhaps most upsetting from Hiromatsu's perspective from several episodes previous. He kills himself in a display that reinforces everyone's faith in Toronaga, and it is implied that this was part of Toronaga's plan and his sacrifice was part of the scheme. But then if Toronaga is taking advantage of events as they come, then was this planned? If not, then it makes little sense, as Hiromatsu is shown from the first moment to hold an unquestioning, unwavering loyalty just like Mariko.In short, I felt like the show was trying to have it both ways- Toronaga is either a master planner or a master user of events. He can't be both, and some of his vassal's actions only make sense if he is one or the other, and those do not really align together to either tell a uniform story or to hold true to each of their characters as presented to us.Maybe it is meant to ask these questions and I missed something in my watch. It is good enough that perhaps I should give it the benefit of the doubt, but I wish it had given us just a little bit more.",6
"Needs better script & lead European actors. Sets & costumes do NOT create a hit story.","Overhyped show. So much potential wasted here. Bad lead European cast. Sets are OK, costumes are credible, sitting in chairs or cross legged is NOT credible for Japanese during 750 AD. Japanese male cast is better. Mariko actress is OK , but better actress, script, & no modern agenda would've improved this series greatly.Some reviewers claim this is next GOT. Def NO. GOT had well known Brit actors/ actresses & unknowns in 1st ep. GOT was global hit bc it's FANTASY with dragons, magic, based on European history. Plus Old HBO had most creative producers, & diverse cast bc they FIT character & could ACT- no political agenda. GOT would never be made now.Here, the lead Englishman male does Tom Hardy ""Mad Max Fury Road"" impression at times. He's not charismatic nor believable. NO prisoner SCREAMS out temper tantrum continually at LEADER of one's captors, esp after witnessing beheadings of natives from samurai swordsmen, & how Japanese ppl act in reverence when in presence of same samurai.Here, the Japanese male lead cast is better but too much importance is placed on Mariko & esp her Catholic beliefs. All Daughters must honor their father's by unquestionable obedience - a duty that remains in modern Japan.The 1980s show was such a huge hit bc of Richard Chamberlain, good script with author's input, realism of male dominance & correct male chauvinism in Japan that also existed GLOBALLY in 750 AD. Yet, the 1980s hit show insulted every American Japanese person I knew. I read the book too- enjoyable fictional tale of Japan from white westernized male view.In real history, Japan distrusted all European missionaries / foreigners, incl Christian religion. These Europeans believed daily bathing caused lethal flue, were riddled with body lice & diseases unknown to Japanese. Europeans were kept on a guarded special island and killed if they left it without escorted permission.Here, I've seen both new released eps. It's average for THIS era. Shame lead ""Englishman"" & Catholic priest are lame. The subtitles are fast a few times & do not bother me. But knowing so much about Japan from close friends, having read bestselling book, studied Japan's history, & remembering original TV massive hit with Chamberlain, causes this series to be a disappointment bc so much potential was discarded. A good story already exists.Thus, Watchable, but not really memorable like the original series nor book.",5
"Difficult to follow","Starring Hiroyuki Sanada this tv show is set in Japan in the era of the Samurai where we see a ship full of foreigners end up being boarded & then taken by the local lord & as they are split up then one or two of the foreigners are killed, the others are allowed to live & the pilot of the ship becomes one of the main characters who is eventually trusted by Lord Toranaga & his followers & is employed by him to help defeat his many enemies in the council of regents who plot against him & want to see him dead. I love Japanese culture & anything to do with the samurai & I wish I spoke the language because although there are quite a few English speaking scenes in this the majority of the scenes are quite rightly spoken in Japanese with English subtitles & so I found myself reading so much of it that I couldn't really watch it & take it in & for that reason I found it difficult to follow & enjoy & so unless you speak Japanese or don't mind watching shows with a lot of subtitles then sadly I would have to advise that you give this a miss.",6
"Shame","It's incredibly disappointing that a creative choice was seemingly made to underlight, badly light, grey haze or blue wash every scene in this series. Considering how much was spent on scenery, costumes and actors, I would have liked to have had a better look. The series from 1980 reminded me that Japan has a sun for a flag. The sun is nearly absent in this newer version. It looked greyer than ""Vikings"". Even the springtime scenes look dreary.It's been years since I've read the book or watched the original mini series, but I know that I am more annoyed by this take than I was with either of those. I loved reading the book and watching the original series, and I wanted to love this more. I do love much of it.",7
"literally unwatchable","The fish eye lens/blurring effect was too distracting for me, this is a worrying trend that needs to be nipped in the bud. Everything is bulging out at me except for the edgesIt makes everything look like I'm watching on a curved TV and the edges are out of focus it looks so bad am i taking crazy pills or is everyone blindAlso they really went overboard with the film grain.Also the subtitles are difficult to read/keep up with, a real failure of cinematography and visuals across the boardreminds me of how distracting the high frame rate was in Avatar 2, very immersion breakingam I the only one?",1
"I had","Thought I had written a review after watching the first few episodes. I guess did not. I would have rated it higher after the first few episodes but then it went completely bizarre and I was left thinking (did I miss a bunch of episodes)? I don't know but it did. I have recently started watching Wuxia-Cdrama and this big production wasn't as good as half of them. If I remember correctly Toranga was charged with a crime punishable by death in the first episode but ( sorry but I've watched so many series in the past month) but I now read a summary and it talks about Toranga and Blackthorne being ambitous men but Blackthorne was bullied into helping Toranga who to me is still unclear of his big ambitions and even what they were and what power he had to in act wield it. What was good in the beginning became an unclear muddled story.",6
"Do not trust","Do not trust the score of the serial that is not yet complete. Wait until after a series is released to see more people's opinions before deciding to watch a series. I think I should have waited until all the episodes of the series were released and then I would pay attention to the score of this series. The trivial sequences with great music make the series seem great, but it is not. There were no educational points that I learned after watching this series. Or at least there were no exciting scenes in it! However, I think this is a matter of taste. Maybe I didn't understand! I might have to watch it a few times to find out!",2
"Not really what I expected.","This show might be good for people who vibe with philosophy and drama. Even if I appreciate the Japanese philosophy of living, the pacing was quite slow. Some dialogues didn't make sense and the amount of sexual scenes were unnecessary.Nearly dropped this show, but I admit things were quite interesting halfway season so I decided to stay. I was anticipating for Toranaga to wear his Japanese armor and the final battle, but sadly it never happened. Instead, we got a five second glimpse into the future. Like, what?Overall, this show is not something I would really recommend despite the high rating. The graphics and costume were nicely done, but the ending ruined it for me.",6
"A more mean spirited version of the original","Shogun way back, the first televised version, had far more elegance and detail than this version. Shogun 2024 is a darker, more mean-spirited version of the origanal book and TV series. It is also racing through the story, this version, omitting so much detail of the story of an English pilot findinh himself in an inter-clan Japanrse war. They have also changed the origiunal story line into a much more violent one than the original. The cast for the most part is outstanding, but not as exciting as the earlier TV version. They are duller, meaner, and darker. The absolute square man playing Anji-san is terrible in this part, the most impotant guy in the story. He is dull, excessively masculine and without an ounce of humor or grace. He is a blunt object, in this version, placed between warring ego-maniacs. Though lavishly produced, there is no grace to the photography or the staging. There are so many subt,le scenes in the original that are entirely missed here. Interesting certainly, but deeply flawed.",2
"Not what James Clavell had in mind","So after episode 4 this is my final review:This Shogun adaption just feels wrong, way too often. Diverting from the source and adapting a story to a modern view can be a good thing, if done right. In this case: It's not done right. And you almost get the impression, that all the good stuff was cut after filming.Switching from muskets training for the regiment to cannons? An ambush with cannons? The Napoleonic Wars? Come on. Cannons in feudal Japan wouldn't be possible, they had virtually no roads and no way to use them in land wars. But hey, it looks cool, so why not?And remember in the book, Blackthorne being outraged after the offer to ""pillow"" with a man? Guess what: That's gone in the FX Adaption. Blackthorne now merely shakes his head and gives a short remark. That's all.Honestly, Disney and FX are going way too far in their censorship of the story. Yeah, the story that takes place at the end of the 16th century. By that time, there wasn't anything like political correctness in the teachings of the Pope.Or maybe that's what the makers of the show mean, when they talk about a modern adaption of the book. I'm sure, James Clavell would die of shame if he wasn't already dead.Shogun by James Clavell isn't a book easily adapted as an TV-Show, and FX did an overall good job. The visuals are stunning, the music is good enough, and the actors aren't bad at all. Sadly, the actors in some key roles could do a lot better, though. Anna Sawai isn't really a good fit for Mariko, if you imagine the well refined woman you read about in the book. But that's something one can live with.The real problem is the kind of loveless adaption of the minor details from the book. Blackthorne walking by the prisoners being crucified or how dehumanizing being pissed on really is for Japanese people - all those important cultural clues are missing in the show.It's a good show, don't get me wrong, but it could be a lot better. So, if you haven't read the book or have never seen the '80s Miniseries, I guess you won't be disappointed.",6
"What a huge disappointment","Shogun is one of my favourite books, a sweeping saga of intrigue, murder, plots within plots, great characterisation. The 1980s series stayed true to all that and more. This 2024 version is like a mouthful of dead sea fruit - green and lush to look at but hollow and lacking in any real substance where it matters.I'm sure why some important key elements of the plot were changed or omitted. What's the point of taking a great story and reducing it to a shadow of what it should be?The romance between Blackthorn and Mariko lacked any depth or passion - it feels more casual, like a one night stand or two.There's little to no coverage of the manipulative evil that was the Catholic church, most of the Jesuits and their machinations were left out of the series completely. We hardly see any of Blackthorn's crew and their degeneration in a land that should have elevated them.Mariko's sacrifice had no impact because there was no build up nor explanation for it until after she was gone. Why was she buried when she was cremated in the book? In the book she states that she is Christian but samurai first. Oh, yeah, let's twist the narrative to suit our 21st century mindsets.As for the change in plot to indicate that Ochiba changed her mind about supporting Ishido, why? She and the heir die which enables Toranaga to become Shogun.What a pile of rubbish. Honestly, this could have been awesome. Instead it's just a rushed version that absolutely annihilates what could have been a masterpiece.",1
"Shogun: Full Season Review","I can see why some think this is a masterpiece, it sure looks that way when compared to most of today's film and tv production.The scenography is excellent, the cast is mostly good, and Hiroyuki Sanada stands out here with his subtle and excellent performance.There is seriousness here, interesting intrigues and fun characters. The violence is shown brutally, as it should be, because that is the violence in real life and it should not be embellished.The atmosphere was interesting and somewhat realistic, it seemed as if after many years we would get a real historical spectacle without the insertion of characters who behave as if they were from the present time, but unfortunately I was mistaken.The writers had to insert a maid who kills Japanese warriors as if they were nothing, when I saw that hilarious scene I knew that this series would be just another one of those unrealistic series that has nothing to do with historical accuracy.Today's historical series are mostly like parodies, this show has a lot of good things, but this kind of thing simply lowers its impression.The direction is good, the soundtrack is solid and fits well with the atmosphere of the series.Of course the series is not historically accurate, the script is sometimes a bit clumsy. Some expressions are too modern, as well as the behaviour of some characters, but this is the standard in series today, it unfortunately lowers the whole impression.I've read that this is just another series where the writers express their hatred for Christians. I understand why some think so. At times it seems so.The series is significantly different from the book and most of the characters are different, especially Mariko. They wrote her as if she came from the 21st century, so unfortunately it seems unconvincing.Toranaga is arguably the best written, with subtle characteristics to make the viewer like him the most.Feudal Japan is a brutal but orderly system, in which mistakes are paid with life, and this is well represented here. The relationships in society are mostly well portrayed, with some exceptions, but hey, at least this series is not a complete parody like for example Vikings: Valhalla.Mostly good and interesting, but unfortunately with the usual flaws. Nevertheless, this series is worth watching, unlike most of today's productions.",6
"What a Mistake","Let me quote Clavell's description of John Blackthorne: "" ... Hendrik looked away from the tall bearded man."" Richard Chamberlain at least looked like the main character. Cosmo Jarvis? Tall? Short, squat, flat faced with a guttural rasp of a voice, and lacking in grace. He did not merely not look like a pilot, nor act like a pilot, he spent the film looking like a pan faced bewildered bull in a ... shop.The group canvasing the actors for this film did a remarkably poor job of casting. That would be the disjointed decision making of Audino, Bolton, Kawamura, Sciff and Webb. There is no chemistry between the actors - surely none between Blackthorne and Mariko in this film. This should have been a critical consideration. The selection of Rodrigez - oh please. Compare this lamentably wane Nestor Carbonel with John Rys-Davies. The acting falls flat in comparison to that of the 1980 TV Series, not simply by cohesion, but by acting ability as well. There is simply no depth.What is worse is the ""creative license"" used to alter the plot in the book. The 1980s series followed the plot from Clavell's book faithfully, allowing the story to unfold in light, in Japan, and at a pace slowly and clearly enough for audiences to follow it. The 2024 version is dark, in British Columbia, and at a rushed pace that makes comprehension a challenge. I needed to stop the stream almost every change of scene to explain the narrative to my husband. This indicates dramatically inferior direction by Toye and van Tolleken.The sole recommendation that I can give this film is a moderate - and I do mean moderate - acting by Hiroyuki Sanada of Lord Toranada. He pales in comparison to Toshiro Mifune. Sanada's acting lacks the depth of Mifune, particularly in point of laughter. Sanada cannot laugh to save his life - in spite of the last line he gives about Blackthorne being kept in Japan because, wait for it, he makes him laugh.This series should have and could have been a marked achievement, but instead was much more like looking through a glass darkly. What a pity. A malign parody of a gem.",1
"Promising start, but missed opportunities and a non fitting finale","I was about ready to give 8 to 10 stars after the first episode. Unfortunately, things started taking a turn for worse. I have two major complaints:1: Like many other reviewers who did not give 10/10 stars, I do not like the casting of Blackthorne. The character barely develops during the show, which seems weird and unfitting for a lead role. His chemistry with Mariko is almost absent. It looked a little promising, but then it just kinda died. Apparently he did have alot of feelings for her, but they are barely shown or expressed. Sure, 10 extra pillowing scenes were not necessary, but some form of development in this area was lacking in my opinion. Apart from that, the actor doesn't seem to show alot of facial expressions and just stares in alot of scenes, which makes him appear unintelligent or constantly overwhelmed (I doubt this is intentional?).2. The finale is very unfitting and anticlimactic in my opinion. Suddenly Blackthorne is just a guy who's kept by Toranaga for laughs and gigs, which definitely was not the case during other episodes. There is no concluding battle scene. That wasn't strictly necessary since it was mainly about the plan that Toranaga had worked out, but just a scene of a hypothetical conversation right before a battle was very lackluster. Also, would ochiba turn on her allies just because of the death of Mariko? I mean sure, its possible since they had a strong bond as they were younger, but there has been just a few scenes of them playing together as kids, or experiencing traumatic events. Perhaps the show is too short to ensure enough development between these two characters.I have not read the book, not have I seen the previous adaptation. I went in with a open mind and was pleasantly surprised at first, but left kind scratching my head when it ended.",7
"Waiting for a big event","If a movie or series is very good, you would like to see it again in the future. I don't want to watch this series again. But, during the weekly airing of the series, I followed it because I was waiting for a big and interesting event to happen in the series. But that never happened. After finishing the series, I think it was a very ordinary series, while before finishing I thought it would be a great series. During the story of the series, there could have been exciting events in one or two episodes to make the story more exciting, but it didn't happen. The fight scenes in the series also seemed a bit artificial.",7
"Slow, disappointing.","Great cinematography, and acting by the Japanese actors, everything else weak. Starts off promising then gets dull. A ton of proverbs that mean nothing. Constant pointless flashbacks. A slow build with the lure of a big payoff - that never happens. Zero humour. If by episode 6 you are bored, stop. It doesn't get better. Why do I need so many freaking characters in my review ?! Ugh, ok. The Caucasian lead has a face that looks weird, because it doesn't move. Are male actors getting Botox now ? There are much better shows out there. Zero chance I'd watch another season. Ok, finally enough characters to end my review.",2
"Good but could have been great: corners cut and a rush to the end","I really enjoyed the first 7 episodes. They were well-paced, with the characters patiently being fleshed out and the stoy well-told. To that point, I'd have given the series a rating of possibly a nine. It's a truly epic and terrific story.Sadly, as typically happens, towards the end there was a rush to get to the end point. As a result, there was too little dramatic build-up to key events, characters acted inexplicably and/or a lot of explanation from them to explain the plot rather than the viewer seeing it unfold. Show, don't tell! This is especiaaly true of the final episode.The acting was excellent, with each key actor given significant, unedited screen time that allows them to act. It was a pleasure to see each fill the scene and the screen, showing both depth and nuance. I can't imagine the casting being any better.On the downside, the director/editor repeatedly takes the soap opera approach of ending scenes with a lingering shot of an actor looking silently into the distance or to the side. It becomes samey and is much like ending every sentence with ellipsis [...].One other annoyance was the use of studios and CGI for many outdoor shots which made scenes look artificial as if it were a Zack Snyder production. I can understand why it was done for cost and logistical reasons, but it was too obviously fake and contrasted greatly with the authentic outdoor shots that breathed life into what is, afterall, a tale about the location as well as the culture.",7
"Awful","This is the worst serial ever. I was expecting it to be a better movie but That's awful. Not suggested anymore. So boring, so slow without any excitement.

"Read the book then review the series","Other than the fact there were no battle scenes, the character portrayals were weak and the show appears to have been written by female freshman at Smith college, this was a mediocre interpretation of Clavell's book.The women in the book were only incidental, in my opinion to the love life of Blackthorne, but the mainstory was Toranaga's deceptions and the battles that took place.Also, there were great story lines among the samurai characters. If you like soap opera's for teenage girls, you are going to love this series.I gave it a 3 star rating for the scenery.I would like to hear from those who have read the book and seen this series for their thoughts.",3
"Too much talking in Japanese , everyone is just talking","I watched it after looking at the rating which was overwhelming but got disappointed. Initially it was too slow i thought that it might get better but no, it was a slow drama throughout the season. First you have to look at the subtitles to understand everything and then there is just talking and more talking. Very less action. Unwanted sexual scenes here and there. Giving 3 for the visuals and acting of some actors.I watched it after looking at the rating which was overwhelming but got disappointed.

"Nothing like Shogun","All those 10/10's is a joke by imbecils, practicly nothing is a 10 because that's perfect, and this is far from that.5/10 is generous and that mostly because it looks pretty good but not much more.The acting is okay but nothing special, particularly not by most of the main cast, specificly Blackthorne.The story and the characters are a mess, it is nothing like the original story and not in a good way.Important storylines skipped, changed or just messed up badly, characters acting out of character or even new plot lines added, stupid stuff and all of it stinks.I wouldn't recomend this to anyone but i guess it beats being stabbed in the eye.It's an affront to the original story, which was acctually good.",5
"One big casting mistake","Why Cosmo Jarvis?I mean all the other actors are flawless and the main character is acting so bad.I am speachless!I quote another review:
""The only thing that brings it down slightly for me is the terrible, hammy overacting of Cosmo Jarvis. I don't know if it's the script that was written for him or what, but his performance just comes off as so...unwatchable. It's like he's trying to do a third-rate channeling of Tom Hardy (who by the way would have been fantastic in this role, in my opinion). Every time Blackthorne opens his mouth I just want to cringe.""Everybody will compare Richard Chamberlain with him.",6
"Cosmo Jarvis","Does anyone else find him almost impossible to watch? Why is he channeling Dustin Hoffman in Hook, it's distractingly bad and I'm only halfway through episode 1.... I am keeping an open mind for the rest of the series but I really have to say, this guy was so poorly cast for this role. If all the white male actors in Hollywood.Despite this one painfully distracting stubbed toe of a flaw, the rest of the casting is fantastic and it's clearly a good looking series. Well shot, cinematography is on point. The Portuguese turned to English is kind of annoying in this day and age but oh well. Can't have it all.",5
"Needed more of a better Blackthorne","I have never read the book but I loved the original mini series with Richard Chamberlin. The first 2 episodes were some of the best television that I have seen in a long time and I couldn't wait to see more. The Asian actors are amazing and the intricate plotting against the beautiful scenery is impressive. The costume design is the best I have seen on tv since Game of Thrones.Unfortunately much of the rest of the series does not live up to the promising start. I put most of the blame for this on the way the series portrays Blackthorne. The actor acts more like a big goofy frat boy than a hardened seaman. As a navigator he would have to be fairly intelligent but we never really see this. There is no chemistry with Mariko. We are told that they are deeply in love but we never really see this relationship develop. He never really seems to be a major character in the story.I found the finale very disappointing. After all of the plotting, buildup and lives sacrificed I expected more.",7
"reminds you of a Hollywood blockbuster","And that is the problem.I relay liked the book and the 1984 version. It was true to the book and the development of the characters was great.This time there is no development. Only spectacle.Where is the attempted suicide of Blacktorh. It's a pivot moment in the story. Because of that I whould never try to blackmail Marico into not committing sepuku, because he understood the need.There is almost nothing done with the crew anymore. In the book it is clear that blacktorn is getting more ja[panese and the crew not. Important for the development.Why should blackthorn leave toranaga. Makes no sense and it is not explained.Why the side line with his son trying to kill toranaga's brother. That makes no sense.The attack with the guns is laughable. No way the guns in that period could shoot that accurate.Even the cloth blacktorn is wearing. I can not imagine that a hatamoto whould wear them. Much to shaby.Why not have the portugese speak portugese, the dutch dutch etc.The screen writer did not understand the book and the subtile weaving of the plot.If you did not see the 1984 version or read the book, it's nice entertainment, but nothing more.",1
"A missed opportunity","I've read the book several times and have the original miniseries on dvd. On the whole, I'm glad I've watched this new version. The modern production techniques make the original series look somewhat dated; however, I think that already being a fan may have detracted from the experience. The book is fantastic and the original miniseries is much closer to the book. In this new version I was regularly filling in gaps and there were a few changes to the the storyline that I found jarring.If you've never read the book or seen the original miniseries you'll likely find this new adaptation enjoyable, otherwise you may, like me, find it a little disappointing and already planning to re-read the book and watch the original.",7
"Not a Patch on the 1980 Version","I found this unbelievably boring. None of the actors are stand out & the annoying bargain basement Richard Burton accent of the lead actor grates.The original casting in the 1980s tv series was knock down stellar with Lady Mariko practically carrying the whole series. This time round she looks & sounds like a flat toned American actress pretending to be Japanese.Lord Toronaga was played by Toshiro Mafuni in the original - no one could ever replace him. As for Lord Yabu, he was so larger than life I couldn't wait for him to show up on the screen in the original - Freddy Takai was amazing. All these actors were utterly believable even if the story was rolled out slowly.How can Shogun be boring??? Terrible script, uninspiring actors, non descript characters that's how. Go back & watch the original tv series if you want to really engage with this story.",2
"Never again...","Perfect for anybody, who never read the book. Missing very important parts from story, what is badly going sideway from the original, simple making everything chaotic and unclear... Many characters dies, who are actually very important part of the end of the (original) story. For this one, doesn't matter.The actors absolutely don't match with the characters, their plays and appears are just simple bad.Totally missing the relation between Toranaga and Blackthorne, what actually made the story interesting. I did not see any clear sign of Blackthorne's evolving, what is a basic of the story. Mixed up conversations and mixed up screens with absolutely different characters, than it should be...
Only the view acceptable but that is all. In anything else, the old series from the 80's was ten times better...
It was really a wasted 10 hours...",1
"Well overhyped, good with flaws","I was looking forward to this but after watching half of the pilot I was starting to wonder how everyone else is giving this 10 stars? I finished and read some online reviews and the endless praising is unwarranted. The Netflix series Marco Polo had one of the highest production costs for it's first season and I was hoping for the same quality here, sadly that's not the case.The writing is simple which is to be expected as it's mostly English subtitles. The musical score is abysmal, the usual background tension drums when anything new or a serious scene is presented. It actually takes away from the scene instead of enhances it. In good television background music goes mostly unnoticed, here it gets annoyingly bad.There are loads of characters which is fine and this pilot is mostly building the world and setting the stage. It's not anything that's out of the ordinary, absolutely amazing storytelling here.The action is minimal and CGI is used to showcase crowd scenes and overhead drone shots.It's 6/10 for the pilot. Maybe a few more shows it'll get better. It's definitely not Marco Polo quality, although it's good enough to keep watching. Perhaps after years of garbage television everyone is just overly excited to watch something decent.",6
"Average show with quite a few unexplained gaps in the plot.","Abrupt ending to the series. Without too many spoilers; there are time-jumps in the final episode between whats now the past and the present where we meet an old decrepit Blackthorn in his final days back at his home in England with his grandchildren marvelling at his worn and chipped katana. However theres no further development in the plot to how he gets back or when he does and how this scene is relevant to the events in Japan. Jump back to Japan, many of the major characters are dead and the story concludes with Toranaga preparing for the final battle against Ishido, with many developments left untreated such as Blackthorns canon training or why Toranaga granted plots to the Christian priests and courtesans in close proximity to each other, whether it was unwitting or a deliberatly plotted move.",5
"A Visual Feudal Journey but","Season 1 of Shogun delivers a good blend of history, drama, and stunning visuals, creating a rich feast for the eyes as it is a dive into feudal Japan. From the moment the show begins, you're drawn in by its settings and beautifully shot scenes. The cinematography truly shines here. Whether it's the sprawling landscapes or intimate character moments, the visuals are undeniably one of the series' strongest assets.The casting is also spot-on. The performances feel authentic, with every actor bringing their character to life in a way that adds layers to the story. The lead performances, especially, are magnetic, pulling you into their emotional struggles and personal ambitions.Where Shogun excels most, however, is in its storytelling. The slow build of the plot feels deliberate, allowing the show to explore the clash of cultures and the weight of tradition versus survival. It's not just a historical drama; it's a look at how characters from vastly different worlds attempt to understand each other, often with conflicting results. The tension of power dynamics and the simmering political unrest are always bubbling under the surface, giving the show an air of unpredictability.That being said, Shogun season 1 does have a few shortcomings. At times, the dialogue can feel overly dense, with long stretches that feel more like conversations about philosophy than moments that drive the plot forward. While this approach adds depth, it can also slow things down considerably, making some episodes feel longer than they need to be. Additionally, while the season builds up well, the finale doesn't quite have the punch you'd expect. It's more of a quiet conclusion, leaving you wanting a little more intensity to match the journey we've been on.Still, despite these minor critiques, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for season 2. If it can maintain the level of quality we've seen in the performances, visuals, and storytelling, Shogun could easily become a standout series. There's so much potential in this world, and with the right pacing adjustments, the show could become even stronger moving forward. For now, I'm hopeful that the next season will continue to build on the solid foundation laid by the first.",7
"Boring and highly overrated","Yet another highly overrated drama by disney. While the setups costumes and environments were all well made, it didn't save the drama from the poor script which is actually flat and boring without much twists and intensity. The actors did play their part but the characters descriptions were as well flat and uninteresting, kind of witless to deal with adversities. And why doesnt shogun uses real historic names? It's kind of a pain to go back and find the actual responding character, which is another failing point of this drama. Shogan spent a lot of time building up but for nothing the ending is another complete let down, theres no real battles nor any good twists, which were all predictable and dull. Whats with all the 10/10 ratings, I wonder how many of them are actually paid reviews, if not all, otherwise these guys have zero sense to rate a drama. Unless the new seasons have better improvements shogun is another pointless waste of time.",3
"Too different from book.","Although I think they are doing a great job with acting and the visuals it seems they are deviating from the book when it isn't necessary. The ability of Blackthorne to learn the language and actually accept the culture is being changed. His friendship with Rodriguez and fight against the Portuguese aren't being used. The machinations of Toranaga are being shortchanged. The village headman being revealed as a samurai working for Toranaga isn't revealed until the end of the book. Although dated now, the mini series in 1980 did a better job of conveying the book. The politics and the moves made by Lady Ochiba and Lady Mariko are not being utilized correctly. The back story on why the Lady Ochiba hates Toranaga should have been explored. Translating a book to the screen is always difficult but they are falling short. Having said that if you haven't read the book I'm sure it's easier to enjoy it.",7
"Its pretty much the same","Update. After waiting and ignoring it for awhile I sat through watched it tell end. If you hated how GoT ended you will hate this. I was so exasperated by the ending I just turned it off and was totally disappointed. Ill say it again the 1989 version was better, explained more, captured just as much violence and sex as this new version and was done WAY better. This was a series that was ripe for being redone. And even modernized a bit a new generation. I was disappointed completely and have decided 3 stars is it. Watch the original version or read the bookAfter third episode Ive become very disappointed they cut out so much Blackthrone saving Toranaga was given small shift they didn't ever go into Blackthorne visiting the black ship and getting saved by the other pilot Why did they cut these out or charge the story. The 1989 Broadcast version followed the book better then this. I guess for a new generation but I would suggest watching the original tv showBy the same I mean its staying pretty clear to the 80's mini-series. You have to understand at the time this was not a normal tv thing. And the amount of sex and violence was big for the time at Primetime network. I like this version ok except for two main things. The music....is awful everyone should be fired from the music department. And whoever graded the color of the film and look its to dark to much at beginning I wish spend more time at the first couple days and how important his time in prison was especially as they have time to add this stuff bug guessing there keeping it for the big battles at the end.",3
"Sad imitation of the 1980 Miniseries","The novel of Shogun originally written by James Clavell was based on the writings of William Adams, who was the first Englishman to set foot in Japan and became the trusted adviser of Japanese shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. William Adams is still a celebrated figure in Japan for building and bring western trader to the Japans. The Blackthorne character in the novel is bright, inquisitive, principled and driven. Well played by Richard Chamberlain in 1980. Maybe it was the script or the actor Cosmo Jarvis but the Blackthorne in this version is inept, mercenary and clumsy for lack of a better term. Mr Jarvis' characterization couldn't build a fire without help. It's fortunate that this iteration changed the focus on to the indigenous principals and not the Blackthorne character but it still skimmed over the palace intrigue. Also missing is Father Alvito who should be the hero when the novel is viewed in terms of Clavell's Objectivist philosophy. Toranaga played well by Hiroyuki Sanada lacks the ruthlessness of Tokugawa Ieyasu who was the real Shogun. The show is a good attempt to tell a great story but some of the characters are just not up to the challenge.",3
"Don't believe the hype. Creating acting, story ok","Yes, I know this is an epic story.The acting was very good from all the cast, this is why I gave it a 7... but the story was good. Not great.It was good to see a story of how Japan saw the western word. Loved that.But the idea of this western (hero) seemed really far fetheched, played out and boring.Everytime everyone is so excited about certain films it's because it make western people look good.It's just boring.It is definitely worth watching, but it is forgetable because this premise has been done over and over again!!It's boring. As I mentioned, played out.Don't believe the hype people.",7
"What a waste of time","Although I appreciated learning about Japanese culture, traditions, and beautiful lands, this fell short of any of the early high rave reviews. I've given this a generous ""2"" because the writers used the word ""realm"" many times and that is my favorite word ever. Otherwise I would've rated a 1. Kudos!Now that we've watched all 10 episodes, we are let down. Throughout the season it was difficult to understand what the strategy of the end game. And in the end it didn't seem like we had an ending or even a cliffhanger. There is absolutely nothing that intrigues me to watch a Season 2. Nothing. Which is really disappointing given the amount of time we've spent watching each week.",2
"Ruined","5 stars for the excellent production values and performances. 0 stars for writers. Ruined the story by, again, adding 21st century ideas into a past civilization. The beauty that could have been. Was so excited and now so disappointed.I'm most sorry for the women whose roles could have been so much better. Instead of showing their brilliance and cunning in a proper historical context the writers decided to put a much more modern spin on the characters. This robbed the characters of their true power and ability.This also deeply impacted the male characters. Torranaga is a shadow of who he was in the book. Blackthorne as well.",5
"Who picked this actor?","Everything is great. The Japanese actors, the production design, the camera work (except for the missing lighting crew!) etc., but who picked the actor who plays Blackthorne? He is not up to the task and ruins this great show. This acting capabilities can much anyone around him.

"Bad movie, like a re-enactment in a historical documentary","Absolutely no match to the 1980 TV series. That one was focusing on the drama, and did not try to look like an authentic depiction of year 1600 Japan. It had dramatic composition, good actors, and beautiful Japanese scenery, none of which this movie has.This movie has absolutely no dramatic composition, it feels like a documentary on Anjin's adventures in Japan, re-enacted, alas the story is almost all made up. It pretends to deliver an authentic year 1600 Japan, they employed all those experts to recreate the contemporary language and textiles, but they put all that in a landscape that is not Japanese at all, it looks like what it is, Canadian. The Japanese architecture is obviously computerI generated, and I guess that it is way too grandiose and lavish for war-torn Japan of the time. You hardly ever see a shot that is all real, no natural light, throughout the movie, it feels like we are in a computer game, and they keep using these wide-angle lenses with blurred and barrel-distorted background, I guess to make the CGI less obvious. The make-up is hardly authentic, rather it is made to look sexy to the modern viewer. Beauty ideals of the period were different; blackening the teeth for example was a common practice, especially for women, never to appear here. Surely the language sounds far more natural to the period than in the 1980 series, but if they paid so much attention to the Japanese language, how come all the Portuguese conversations are in English? The acting is dry, as you expect in a re-enacting, but Mariko is particularly disturbing, her Westernized facial gestures and walking clumsily in kimono is inauthentic even for a modern Japanese.",4
"Historically incorrect","For a series with this hype, it's incredible to see some historical errors that any amateur historian could solve. 1 - The boats, whether Japanese, Dutch or Portuguese, are not those that appear in the series. 2 - Some costumes, particularly Western ones, don't either. 3 - But even more ridiculous is that we have an English sailor, on board a Dutch ship, who arrives in a small Japanese village where he meets a Japanese translator who only speaks Portuguese but who translates into English. The Portuguese are supposed to be the villains - forgeting the fact that in Japan they were just traders who almost never left the port - but not a word of their language is heard in the entire show or even any correct historic representation of them. Ridiculous. This is a show made for english speaking people with a disney like historical knowlege.",6
"Extremely boring","I'm a big fan of this genre but this show is just not it.Pros:
1)amazing sceneries. Video is high level, no doubt
2)that's itCons:
1)plain boring. Endless dialogues, maybe 10min of actual action each episodes. I was fast forwarding all the time and...what's the point to watch it then?2)I'm sorry but I don't wanna read subtitles for 45-50 minutes each episode(reminder: it's all dialogues non stop, mostly in Japanese)
3)Actors aren't the best, mediocre play
4)probably most of people aren't familiar with Japanese history so explanation would be nice. They just throw random words like Shogun, Ronin, Samurai etc expecting wow effect? Guys nobody knows who ronins areOverall huge waste of time, I stopped mid 4th episode with no plans to continue.",3
"Incarceration at a Japanese restaurant.","The start of this show is fresh. The experience of getting to know traditional Japanese culture one by one is attractive. But when I get used to that unfamiliarity and awkwardness, I realize that this show's main dish is delayed too much.The main characters are always stuck somewhere. They're stuck in Osaka at the beginning and in a small fishing village from the middle. Most of the conversation is ""Just don't do it"". It feels like being controlled by every action in a Japanese master's restaurant.It's not good to use an entire season for a build-up. I don't know how much bigger story remains in this show's future, but I'm definitely disappointed with the performance of this season itself.",6
"Had a great opportunity, but got a bigger miss!","During the first couple of episodes, the story deviated somewhat to the book although I didnt like, I understood.But cmon! The last two episodes is like throwing away the book and make a whole new story, great moments left out, Anjin never learns Japanese, the Mariko and Anjin relationship erased, they almost took out the Catholic plot line, the dead of Toranaga's son, and lastly Hiromatsu sepukku. All of those made me really dislike the show. If it works don't fix it, 1980 was far superior in the plot and acting, the book is a must for every fan of Feudal Japan, but this is an atrocity towards the book and so inferior to its predecessor.",2
"It's a good drama, but not action.","In fact, this is a drama series, many users, even myself, were deceived. The series is well made, but I would like to see action scenes in a seri in this level.Interesting scenes and visual sequences were interesting, but I think the story line was very slow, I would have liked to see the Japanese version of Game of Thrones, but the two are very different.Nothing excites me as much as watching historical series, I must say that I liked this series, it may not be a masterpiece, but as I said, it is a good and entertaining drama series, but my expectations were higher.I like Japanese culture :)",7
"Disappointing Depiction of Samurai","As a fan of samurai tales and action-packed adventures, diving into Disney+'s Shogun series was a highly anticipated journey. However, what awaited was a tedious and lackluster portrayal that fell far short of expectations.One of the most glaring issues with Shogun is its painfully slow pacing. Instead of the thrilling battles and dynamic swordplay one would expect from a series set in feudal Japan, viewers are subjected to drawn-out dialogues and a plodding narrative that fails to captivate.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect is the scarcity of action scenes. Samurais are renowned for their martial prowess and the epic clashes they engage in, yet Shogun fails to deliver on this front. Instead, it relies heavily on verbose exchanges that do little to propel the story forward.Despite its high rating and considerable hype, Shogun ultimately proves to be a test of endurance rather than an engaging viewing experience. It's a prime example of overrated media that fails to live up to its acclaim, leaving audiences wondering what all the fuss was about.",2
"Portuguese speaks English now?","This is outrageous, how come the Japanese speak their language and then when comes to speak Portuguese they speak English?I am Loving the story, quite interesting visuals and costumes but by not speaking portuguÃªs makes the show not an accurate story and lazy production.I can't wait to see what's coming up but I doubt it will get any Portuguese language at all.What struck me is that nowadays there is so much tension about multiracial and equality and now we see this happening it's a kind of offence by not speaking the right language. Can you imagine if the British spoke American? Or the other way around?",7
"Dark","Without Orson Wells, (or any) narrator, it was difficult to follow. While I don't mind a certain level of realism, if it's so harsh and dirty it starts to lose the entertainment value. Another ""remake"" that didn't need to be remade.Hollywood should try to make something new instead of over dramatizing older shows in an effort to be ""new"".This review really doesn't need to be the required 600 words,I have said all I need to say, but, I suppose there are many more word to describe this show. Like exhausting.I really preferred the original, like the remake of Perry Mason, it was attempted to be ""gritty"" to the point of ridiculous. Ah, my minimum character number has been met.This is my opinion only. If you have never watched the original, you should.",3
"Great series but...where is the Portuguese language?","The plot is really good, the first 3 episodes very good and very accurate. Great series....but, where is the Portuguese language?The japanese people speaks their own language but when a Portuguese translator is needed the characters speaks in English.The directors should be more careful with this, and this issue is enough to put me off with the series and downgrade this much my rate instead of a 10 if they speak the correct language, it's really annoying specially for a Portuguese speaker waiting for my own language and then...english. Really disappointed.If there will be second season the producers should rethink about this.",6
"Disappointing adaptation","My rating of this show is low as found boring. I have read the book and loved it and series does not grasp even a fraction of that. The korean dramas are so popular because they show the content with emotions in details and keep you involved. Don't know why they had to run a bullet train here, many more episodes could had been added. Missed many important events like Yabushige's suicide and the events leading upto it. They did go in depth of Mariko and Pilot's emotional relationship. Did not show Toranaga decision of burning Anjin ships. Missed out on showing the inter personal relations between characters, also missed out on showing the real political issues and role of religion in that era and lastly forget to mention the conclusion, result of the war which was mentioned in the book.",3
"Samurai 'BARBIE' ?????","Though it may seem counterintuitive, nevertheless, take a moment and try on the idea that Blackthorne is a 'Ken.'Immediately, so much that was puzzling about Blackthorne becomes intelligible: how he can be useless yet also sexy, central to the plot but also the object of derision.And if Blackthorne is a Ken, Mariko becomes a Barbie (a woman deprived of agency), while Toranaga corresponds to America Ferrara (who, if you recall, is the one who schemes to subvert Ken's 'patriarchy.')The reason for the correspondence is that underlying both shows is the same post-modern feminist notion of 'the patriarchy': straight white men have seized power unfairly, causing women and men of color to be 'marginalized.'Accordingly, in order to rectify the situation, i.e., subvert the patriarchy, straight white men must be 'de-centered' and moved to the margins, while women and men of color have to be moved to the center.Doing precisely that is what this 'reimagined' version of 'Shogun' is up to: 'de-centering' Blackthorne and replacing him at the center with Mariko and Toranaga.Thus virtually the entire show is about Power - who gets to wield it, who does not, and where one fits in to the system.This show ends with Toranaga standing godlike on a hill looking out over the water, contemplating the hills beyond, as though envisioning the future.Plainly, what the show runners admire about their versions of Toranaga and Mariko is that they have succeeded in subverting the power system of their time and place.Unfortunately, as many viewers have observed, this comes at a cost. It is hard to relate to them. One can admire this Toranaga and esteem this version of Mariko, but not truly love them.The exceptions prove the rule. It's indicative of their position outside the constraints of feminist post-modernism that Fuji and Yabushige are the two most human characters, as well as the most popular.",6
"1 star because the episodes were way too long and the series was therefore boring.","I think Shogun is a very mediocre serie. It was hard to get into the story in the first episode, it was hard to follow at first. Once I got into it, I found the story interesting and slow at the same time. But what bothered me most was that each episode was way too long, about 50 to 70 minutes per episode for this series was really way too long, I think 30 minutes per episode is just enough. Which the reason for my low rating. As a result, you watched too many boring scenes and conversations that added nothing to the story or were entertaining. This made it difficult for me to get through each episode and what also didn't help was that some of the characters are very annoying(like John Blackthorne and Mariko). Fortunately, there was also action, tension and a number of fun and some good characters (of which unfortunately a number of are dead now that a second season has been announced, which is a shame). Only not enough to give it an extra star.",1
"Could Have Been 9 or 10","Intriguing story loosely based on historical events. Beautiful cinematography and costumes. But like most modern productions, it is marred by unnecessary profanity and explicit sex.It is a ""slow burning"" drama which builds upon the political and religious rivalries of the time. The Japanese culture is cast as the refined culture while the English are thought to be barbarians. The Portuguese Catholic missionaries are only tolerated for what they can contribute to the Japanese Lords.It is all delicate balancing act as rivals from all walks of life struggle to come out on top.Overall, a compelling drama that could have been more enjoyable without the unnecessary language and sex. (The latter is part of the story, but was distracting in the way it was portrayed.)",7
"This is a perfect 10, if you like millennial versions of a classic book","I won't repeat what others have said, but the criticisms are oh so true. The main character is absolutely despicable, Lacking common sense, etiquette, and morals. When you're taken prisoner, for example, is it better to be a loudmouth rabble rouser, or just quietly assess the situation and figure out what's going on. He chose to be the loudmouth. People getting beheaded left and right for minor offenses, but they let this Englishman live? Ridiculous writing. The writers have him say the F word constantly, which makes teenagers watching this giggle, But it ruins it for a more discerning audience. The Portuguese Catholics and the Japanese lords have a successful trade agreement going on, and this one anti-catholic vulgar charlatan is going to change their minds overnight? The hip young women writers on this show made me give up after three episodes and go rewatch the Richard Chamberlain superior version.",3
"Japanese power struggle","Regretfully I expected more from this, after the raving reviews it received. Nearly all the dialogue is carried out in japanese, and while that legitimates the authenticity it was also the single biggest problem I had with this series. It simply disconnected me from the story reading it from closed caption. The way the dialogue was carried out in a polite, passive aggressive, poetic way got tedious at times. I get that probably depicts the japanese way of life but it was nevertheless dull to listen to.Cosmo Jarvis was miscasted in my opinion, his acting being quite one dimensional. He had like one expression that he recycled through the entire thing. The japanese actors were ok, albeit not spectacular in any way. Surprised Ken Watanabe didn't qualify for this as he's seen on most asian productions.The story itself was a rather cloggy mess of struggle for power and influence. I never really got invested in the Anjin's struggles, or anyone elses for that matter. The middle part of the series was the weakest where the story seemed to stand still at times. It got a bit better towards the end but not enough to make this worth while. This became a chore to sit through, and that is never a good grade for a series. I gather the budget for this series was substantial, but the end product didn't reflect that. A second season is apparently in the making, as strange as it seems. I doubt I'll give it a go.",5
"Like watching paint dry in the name of honour and loyalty.","This show's a slow burner, and I mean sloooow... I bring this up because I'm somewhat surprised by its high rating.Almost every situation or conversation feels like a thin layer of butter spread over too much bread. The issue is that the scenes often lack the weight or aesthetic to give them that zoomed-in quality, failing to draw me in but requiring close attention to grasp the story.I get the impression that 'Shogun' gained many admirers due to romantic or awe-inspiring notions about Japanese feudal culture and the customs depicted here.However, judging from this series, this culture is nothing short of a prison where people make heavy sacrifices, sometimes even themselves with the utterly brutal seppuku, and practice self-censorship-all to serve a collective goal that benefits no one individually.This so-called honor and adherence to 'noble' principles seem more like blind obedience and peer pressure.The main character is John Blackthorne, whom I found to be a very uneasy mix of awkwardness, roughness, comic relief, virility, cerebralness, and so on. I've never seen a man quite like him before, but here he is.And then there's Mariko, the unfathomable tragic beauty, whose effect-seeking written character got on my nerves a bit. The same goes for the antagonist Lady Ochiba, who has this 'OTS' kind of vibe about her.There are, of course, cool male leads to enjoy like Hiroyuki Sanada, Tadanobu Asano-always a pleasure to watch-and a strong performance from Takehiro Hira, whom I probably hadn't heard of before. I didn't find the cinematography amazing; it's good, but not spectacular. However, I must give an honorable mention to the clothes and samurai costumes-they are extraordinary.The show is well-written, for sure, but I'm talking about its presentation. On the entertainment meter-does it have the magnetic/emotional pull of the current 'House of the Dragon' or the cunningness and vibrant characters of 'Better Call Saul'?For me, the answer is no, and compared to the greats- it's no more than a 7 from me.In the end, you do get rewarded for hanging in there. But it's like watching paint dry, only to find out the color turned out prettier than expected.",7

For this series.I am angry about this choice, because I am interested in both the script and the acting of other actors.In other words, the presence of Mr. Jarvis made me stop watching the series.Mr. Jarvis' cold acting, childish tantrums, completely artificial and unbelievable emotions made me unable to sink into the movie.I wish the director would give an explanation about their choice, or if anyone knows, let me know.How can you ruin a first-class series in such a childish way?

He'll question ever illogical sacrifice, fight his way through the intrigues of the dastardly Portuguese, and with good old plain English straight-talking he'll shake the cobwebs from the rigid politics of feudal Japan.Well done, sir. WELL DONE SIR I SAY! Rule Britannia and Rule Cliche.And we can add to this the ludicrous overacting of the main character, which were he not a Brit I would put down to parody as opposed to jingoism.",2
"got GOT, nope","I read a review on this comparing it to an expansive saga that was beyond GOT but now I'm not sure if they were on something or watching something else. The blame had to fall this time mainly on the director. Ok, maybe this would make more sense if I remember the original or read the book and maybe it makes more sense with the last two parts, but all I got from this was some convoluted story and some pretty pictures and eye candy. Of course you have to have some bad blank female and an attack on our obviously patriarchical culture but c'mon. Nothing really makes much sense and the historical parts that ham fisted in are too much and too repetitive. It's true, that the japanese considered the portugese as uncivilized savages but do they really need to keep hammering this. (interesting aside, in the greek days anyone who wasn't greek and spoke creek was referred to as a barbarian or one who babbled, which got adopted by the romans and the name barbara literally means woman of the man who babbles, google it). The japanese culture was minimalist because they all live on islands and because they had to place a moratorium on cutting trees before there were no more trees. The japanese were also a warlike society and there was constant infighting but if everyone committed suicide so easy you have to wonder how there was anyone left, or how does someone hit forty, when they could be cutting themselves open for almost any bloop. Japan was also a much more open society regarding sex, hence the fisherman's wife and much more patriarchal than depicted. But, they didn't wear the classy outfits like shown. That's for 2024, not 1600s. The worst part though is the story which makes very little sense if you know any history at all. It's very hard to follow the story between the long takes of someone's face punctuated by a twitch here and there. That's nobody else's fault except the director. It's the director's responsibility to tell the story and doesn't include repetitive historical references which most people wouldn't understand today. And one thing glaringly missing is the japanese side to religion. In two episodes they haven't mentioned anything but the adoption of christianity and the persecution but nothing about shinto or buddhism which would have been the primary religion of choice. C'mon.",6
"Visually very impressive","I'm happy to give 10 stars for sets, lighting, costumes, hair, sound and nature. That excited me from the start and kept me going. The world that they have visually created is very extraordinary and that's why it's worth watching the show. I don't remember the original series. However, after initial enthusiasm, I found the story more like a telenovela. There's not much of Japanese martial arts to be seen, more tiresome political dialogues. For me, most of the actors are convincing and charismatic. Unfortunately, the main actor doesn't convince me in the role. He is strangely wooden and stiff. In this respect, I have very conflicting feelings. But I'll keep watching it in the hope that the storytelling will convince me at some point.",5
"Worth a watch, better than expected","Miles and miles better than the book, which was a mess I couldn't even bring myself to fully get through. It's fair to say this is probably more like a fantasy epic for all its historical accuracy, but it does correct a lot of the issues I saw, as a laymen, with the book only 30% through.The performances, production values, character arcs, all come together to make for a surprisingly entertaining tale. The novel being so universally known and sold so well, it makes sense why they didn't adapt something classical from the Japanese cannon, and done it some justice. But maybe with this success there is room for that as well.",7
"Stupid ending","Mariko blows up, and that's it? Don't we even get to find out why? What a terrible way to mar up a good show. After nine episodes just to have a major character sacrifice herself for nothing and we never learn what happens to anyone else. That's just weird. Why would they stop it there? I've never read the book -- is that how it ends? I might never have started watching if it was going to end so cimpletely inconclusively. I mean all those other hostages in the locked room and that's it. I just don't get why they stopped there. It's like a dirty trick on the audience. Who lived, who died, what happened, who cares??? Dumb. Just dumb.",4
"Dialogs only... Boring","I actually found this series quite boring, i always doze off while watching it and have to rewind. All you see is people speaking Japanese. There's no entertainment value. This could have been a podcast and you wouldn't miss much. I can't believe people dare comparing this to Game of Thrones. Yes G. O. T. Is made of political intrigues and had a lot of dialogs but first we knew who was speaking and were familiar with their characters. G. O. T. Is a characters masterpiece. Furthermore G. O. T. Had epic battles, dragons, monsters etc. Shogun tricks the viewers by giving a little bit to make them believe more is there. In the first episode you have brief nudity for those who are into that and that's it. At the end of episode 2 you have 30 seconds of action to make you want to watch the next episode. But in fact there's not much happening. In the 3rd episode there is action but it's in the dark. Another trick by a cheap production because in the dark they don't have to worry too much about details. Also the big-headed, dead eyes actor who plays John Blackthorn is not very good. There are so many great British actors who would have nailed that part. I rated it 2 stars for the costumes and the sets but that's really all we've got here. This is no game of thrones. One episode of game of thrones cost more to make than this entire series.",2
"Extremely overrated. Overhyped. Terrible pacing. Never hooks you in...","First of all, I'm Japanese, so I have no immediate bias towards this show just because it has to do with Samurai; I know there are geeks, otakus, out there that just think it's automatically cool/good show because of the theme/visuals.Don't let the cinematography (yes, of course, it looks great... minus the terrible obvious CG backgrounds) fool you. The story and pacing is HORRIBLE.I watched this with high hopes; I really tried to get into it, but I just couldn't... I stopped watching after end of Episode 2. It just NEVER hooks you in. (maybe it gets better in the later episodes, but the fact that it takes this long to hook you in just says how overrated this show is)The show just drags forever with the prisoner and several clans just rambling back and forth. Just get to the point. Where is the real drama and suspense? Who are we supposed to care for?I recommend watching Martin Scorsese's 2016 film ""Silence"" instead (it even stars the same actor 'Tadanobu Asano'); that was a movie I actually enjoyed, so it's obviously not the theme/history that I can't handle.",2
"Brilliant with way too much filler","To coin a colloquialism...it was all boot and no cowboy.Brilliant production values. Very good acting all around. The cinematography is frankly, mind blowing. Every scene was directed pretty much exactly right. So what's the problem?The story was basically stalled for half the series. The first half of the series was full of adventure, warfare, cunning and intrigue to set the stage. Ok..I'm totally in...let's have the payoff.Then no payoff....and more no payoff...and the series ends with still no payoff.Good job getting me to watch to the end but bloody hell, the last 3 or 4 episodes was one long, slow, cliffhanger. Not cool, man...not cool.Nothing happened. Yeah, some stuff happened but nothing to move the plot along. Nothing was settled. The last two episodes were especially disappointing but I could kind of see this coming. There was way too much to do and not enough time to do it.I prepared myself for this but it didn't help. It still sucked. It's not the waiting for next season thing that bugs me. It's the having needlessly wasted my time for 3 or 4 hours that bugs me.You can only spend so much time looking out the window at a beautiful tableau. That's what this felt like. It was a pretty picture, not a story.",6
"So much for a Japanese ""honour""","I actually liked this series, at least for half season. But as the story continued, turned out Toranaga as a leader, was willing to sacrifice anyone (but himself) for his personal cause (to be a shogun). Most of his closest friends and family died, not by fighting the enemies but by being taken advantage of their loyalties. In fact Toranaga gave them a ""purpose"" to die, wrapped in a so called ""honour"". In the end he was the only one who won. I can only imagine how cold he was as a character, enjoying his victory and living rest of his life at ease with all his closest friends and family died on his watch. I had high hopes that Toranaga would turn out to be a honourable leader like Katsumoto in ""The Last Samurai"". So much for a Japanese ""honour"". I'm only glad I didn't read the book, saved my time by watching the series but regret that such an awful character won the story.",4
"Asian actors were great...","...but they killed off the best actor in episode nine. Mariko really carried the show. Meanwhile the Blackthorne actor was the absolute worst. I'm sure they made him look even weaker when compared to the strong Japanese cast. And I do think episodes seven through nine dragged on a little too long. Too much focus on the ancillary characters rather than moving ahead on the plans to defeat the Council of Regents. And let me say it again, Mariko and the actor that portrayed her should have been alive at the end. Just a sorry way to end an otherwise interesting and well played series. Also, contributes to the history of Japan albeit in a fictional context.",7
"Hiroyuki Sanada and a fellow movie buff's recommendation are why I watched this. Sadly, only one delivered.","I am only one and a half episodes in and quite frankly, I've seen enough. I did not read the novel. I did watch some of the version with Richard Chamberlain. It made no impression on me.What did make an impression on me was the made for TV script and direction. What I assume was an effort to create misdirection about the plot only leads to indifference.Naturally, due to being a fan of Sanada, that was my side. The guy who plays the Brit, can't remember the actor's name, his performance seems like a mix of a Gerard Butler wannabe channeling a Tom Hardy who is not an actor. Or vice versa.The constant changing of loyalties without establishing the characters of each and every faction is annoying. Characters have to be established. Otherwise you have no idea how you feel about them. Now you have no idea, however it may be overturned as the plot unfolds, who you are rooting for and against.Also, the ceremonial reverence and respect for the tradition of this culture is lost as both actors and extras just stumble about clumsily in ham-handed mimicry.This production is distracting and constantly fights against the story it claims to be telling.",3
"Original is Far Better by Miles -","One star is a little harsh, but only because I'm comparing it to the original, which is much better. This new series has beautiful and updated photography but lacks the compelling depth, acting and superior story telling of the first. The 1980 version was an amazing study in culture and politics while this one feels more like a Transformer movie. Perhaps if you haven't seen the first, you'll not know what you're missing and can enjoy it for what it is. Trying to remake a classic is hard I applaud the artists' efforts, I realize it's a different telling of the story. I've seen remakes that I thought were good, and with that being said, for me, this one just doesn't hit the mark.",1
"Stunning Cinematography, but Lacking in Action !","Shogun is a visual masterpiece that immerses viewers in the rich tapestry of historical Japan. The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking, capturing the essence of 17th-century Japan with meticulous detail and vibrant visuals. From the lush landscapes to the intricately designed costumes, every frame is a testament to the dedication and artistry of the production team.The show excels in its portrayal of the cultural and social dynamics of the time. It offers an in-depth look at the customs, politics, and daily life of feudal Japan, providing an educational yet engaging experience. The characters are well-developed, and the dialogue is sharp, reflecting the complex interplay of power, honor, and intrigue that defines the period.However, while ""Shogun"" delivers on atmosphere and character-driven storytelling, it falls short in the action department. Despite the rich historical backdrop ripe for epic battles and dramatic conflicts, the series tends to avoid the war and exciting moments that many viewers might expect. Instead, it leans heavily on dialogue and political maneuvering, which, although intriguing, can feel like a letdown when anticipating more dynamic sequences.This focus on talk and trickery creates a mixed experience. On one hand, it's fascinating to see the strategic minds at work and the subtle manipulations unfold. On the other hand, the lack of visceral, high-stakes action can make the narrative feel somewhat stagnant and anticlimactic. The promise of thrilling confrontations and decisive moments often gives way to slower, more cerebral scenes that, while well-executed, may not satisfy all viewers.In summary, ""Shogun"" is a beautifully crafted series that offers a deep dive into historical Japan, complete with stellar cinematography and rich cultural insights. Yet, its reluctance to fully embrace the dramatic potential of its setting and time period leaves it feeling incomplete. For those seeking an intellectual and visually stunning journey, ""Shogun"" will not disappoint. But for viewers craving the excitement of battle and the thrill of action, it may fall short of expectations.",7
"What is the point?","I watched the original 1980's series and really enjoyed it so was pleased to see it had been remade. With great anticipation I watched the new series, or at least so far. Only finding the there is, and a further search later, finding that there was never any intention of completing the whole book... Tell me, what is the point. Let's just do up to act 2 of a 3 act play, or perhaps Obi Wan being murdered by Darth Vader then stopping filming. This along with the earlier series The Borgias is just pathetic. In future I will await a completed product before investing my time in a half cocked production. Cheers, Paul.",1
"What foreigners expect feudal Japan would be like","The series is very well produced, the actors, props, sets and CGI are all top notch. My only issue with it is the over sensationalization of western ideology of feudal Japanese culture. Not saying concepts such as honor, duty, seppuku etc weren't important in feudal Japan, but for anyone that has watched Japanese produced period drama or have read any of their historical novels would know its not as heavily dramatized like in this series.The plotline is loosely based on the origin story of the Tokugawa shogunate, but again its overly sensationalized on what western people perceive to be Japanese culture and missed on the actual key events that put Tokugawa in power. Not saying it should've been a exact carbon copy of the history books, but must of what propels the series plotline makes very little sense in the historical and cultural context.",6
"As good as Matrix 4","For those who have read the book, the movie should be extraordinarily stupid. The action is largely respected, the characters do not respect the book's pattern. None of the characters respects the original description. Compared to the book, the movie is dull and boring. Compared to the 1980 screening, the present film seems lacking in vision, creating the impression of a low-budget film. The musket regiment was transformed into a cannon regiment. The weather in the film is always gloomy, even snow appears in some sequences, unlike the book where the weather is presented as clear and warm.The scene of the earthquake seems to be from another story. In the book died 140 samurai, in the film several thousand dead samurai are mentioned.The relationship between Anjin-san and Mariko-san is dry and lacking in involvement, unlike the original. The actor who plays Anjin-san doesn't even think he's read the book. The lines are dry and soulless. It seems that the screenwriter himself is included in the category of those who would not have read the book, the lines and sequences being represented as if he had heard the story from someone else and tried to improvise.",1
"Cosmo is no Tom Hardy.","Kurosawa directed a masterpiece in 1957, Seven Samurai. This is something I've went back to many times, sadly I don't think Shogun warrants repeated plays.By no means is this a poor show, it certainly doesn't warrant some of the criticism, this is a good show; a good show not a great one.The casting is exceptional and the acting really very good, the story itself is also very good, the pace, atmosphere, cinematography all really very good.I think the thing for me that knocks this from a solid 9 to a 7, is the character played by Cosmo Jarvis.It's like he's sat down and watched the excellent TV series, Taboo, and tried to emulate some of the characteristics that Tom Hardy displayed playing the character James Delaney.I'm sure had I not seen Taboo, this may have went completely over my head, however I have and this just seems like a less convincing version of a character.That said, it is a good show and I'm sure I'll be there if and when they do a second series.",7
"All the dialog in ""Portuguese"" is English","First of all, I know I'm biased because I'm Portuguese, but in a show of this level hearing in Japanese that the next discussion would be in Portuguese and immediately the conversation is in English is simply a huge flaw for me. I really appreciate you putting on a show of this quality and dimension where Portugal is mentioned, and I obviously realize that for most people the dialogue that was supposed to be in Portuguese is actually in English, which makes no difference and only helps the show to flow and grow. However, it's still quite difficult for me to accept this fact. However, I will try to continue watching the show and try to ignore this (which I believe will be quite an impossible task). I hope no one is offended by this comment. Have a good day/night everyone. Thank you!",1
"Ok series but with a lot of errors","I like the series and think the Japanese actors are decent but Jarvis playing the lead role has no charisma and seems lost in himself all the time.Historical errors as others already said.Why the didn't cast a better lead? I understand the maybe want a unfamiliar face but why pick one without any charisma or acting skills? The didn't have a casting? This destroys the whole serie. Why not have a lead like Colin Farrell or Robert Pattison?Except the poor leadrole the other actors try but the story is many times both rushed or felt misguided. An exemple is when the look at the sunrise and we as spectators only see the actors and no sunrise. Many things in the story is actors telling instead of showing with places and views. Could be done bettter but I gonna see it through for I like samurais.Why should You give up 10 hours of your life with these serie? I don't know really and I hope Jarvis acting gets better or I'm putting the lid om this serie.",7
"Modernised Japan","The first two episodes were promising but then it starts to fall apart. Too many unnecessary subplots, graphic violence and sex. Might as well be another Game of Thrones.For example in episode 6, there is war on the horizon between Lord Toranaga (Sanada) and the council led primarily by Lord Ishido (Hira) but the focus here is on the negotiation of the price for the courtesan Kiku (Kouri) to spend a night with Blackthorne (Jarvis) in what is supposedly a seductive scene hence the title of the episode ""Ladies of the Willow World."" This happens after a major earthquake; Mariko's (Sawai) flashbacks; Lady Ochiba No Kata (Nikaido) plotting war - which are all glazed over subplots. The Noh theatre scene even has more screen time than the major storyline.If it's not for Sanada, I would have stopped watching, even he seems bored. Another critic who read the book and watched the original 80's series commented that the writers must have skimped over the pages or didn't bother reading it altogether. This lack of research shows in the way the characters behave and talk as if they're in the 20th Century, not feudal Japan.The characters are under developed, no chemistry between Mariko and Blackthorne. The Portuguese priests are sidelined when they are crucial to the story. Half way through, we're now learning of the link between Mariko and Ochiba and the latter's vengeance for Toranaga. The editing slices and dice up the scenes which makes the story confusing to follow. With four episodes to go, I'm not having high hopes. Such a wasted opportunity, could have been a standout series based on a best selling book or the Japanese history which should have provided a lot of material to get inspiration from. But alas, it's the 21st Century and it's all about instant gratification, lazy writing where truth doesn't matter anymore.",4
"A lack of diversity /s","I remember my grandmother saying to me: I don't care what they tell you in school, Shogun was black. /s""Shogun"" is a riveting television series that breathes new life into the timeless tale of cultural clash and political intrigue set in feudal Japan. Released in 2024, this adaptation brings James Clavell's epic novel to the screen with a modern sensibility, offering a fresh perspective on the classic story.From its opening scenes, ""Shogun"" captivates audiences with its stunning visuals and meticulous attention to detail. The production design is nothing short of spectacular, transporting viewers to 17th-century Japan with breathtaking authenticity. From the ornate palaces of the samurai lords to the bustling streets of Edo, every aspect of the show's world-building is meticulously crafted to immerse viewers in the sights and sounds of feudal Japan.At the heart of ""Shogun"" are its characters, brought to life by a talented ensemble cast. In the role of John Blackthorne, the English navigator shipwrecked in Japan, viewers are treated to a nuanced and compelling performance by Cosmo Jarvis. His journey from outsider to insider, as he navigates the treacherous waters of Japanese politics and culture, forms the emotional core of the series. Alongside him, Anna Sawai delivers a standout performance as the enigmatic Lady Mariko, whose wisdom and strength serve as a guiding light for Blackthorne amidst the chaos of feudal Japan.What sets this adaptation of ""Shogun"" apart is its willingness to delve deeper into the complexities of cultural exchange and understanding. While the original novel and previous adaptations focused primarily on Blackthorne's perspective, this series offers a more balanced portrayal, giving voice to the Japanese characters and their experiences. Through their eyes, viewers gain insight into the rich tapestry of Japanese society - its customs, traditions, and underlying tensions - and come to appreciate the depth and complexity of the culture that Blackthorne encounters.In addition to its cultural themes, ""Shogun"" also delivers plenty of suspense and intrigue. The political machinations of the samurai clans, the rivalry between the wily Lord Toranaga and his ambitious rivals, and Blackthorne's own struggle for survival all combine to create a gripping narrative that keeps viewers hooked from episode to episode.Despite its sprawling scope, ""Shogun"" never loses sight of its central themes or characters. The pacing is brisk, the storytelling is tight, and each episode builds upon the last to create a cohesive and compelling narrative arc. Whether you're a fan of historical drama, political intrigue, or character-driven storytelling, ""Shogun"" offers something for everyone.In conclusion, ""Shogun"" is a triumph of television storytelling. With its stunning visuals, stellar performances, and thought-provoking themes, it transports viewers to a fascinating and exotic world while also offering profound insights into the nature of cultural exchange and understanding. Whether you're familiar with the story or experiencing it for the first time, ""Shogun"" is not to be missed.",7
"2 huge issues i cant look past","This show could have gotten a high rating from me if not for those issues.First issue they speak Portugese in English. This is quite an issue as a Japanese who is learning Portugese is following an English conversation....
This is even hinted at from an early stage. I am English, but luckily for us all I am fluent in Portugese.The second issue is the style direction.Most of the times the backgrounds are blurred , this takes away the reality and as such my engagement. It often feels like most shots were made inside a studio.Japan is a very beautiful country so I think they missed a huge opportunity there.The minor issue is that the story is to convenient. The Macao incident is spoonfed to him while he is in prison. The fact that he is in prison is by chance and the person he meets there is by chance as well. He also was aware of Macao in some degree according to his diary. That as far as i watched hasnt been destroyed yet.There are more issues, he was just a navigator and he was picked without looking at any of the other sailors from the hull.This makes the entire story unbelievable and given the stylistic choice to blur the backgrounds this is more than a problem than it should be. I am constantly reminded this is just a cleverly written piece where everything falls together like a puzzle and not an account of what happened.I try not to use spoilers but I think I gave some. So this probably wont be read by anyone. If you read it, please rate it how you see fit. I think this was very close to being great but two choices were pretty bad.I finish episode 2. And unlike house of ninjas which also had plenty of issues i am not likely to finish this.",2
"I think japanese historians are reviewing this show","I think japanese historians are reviewing this show, its good in places, like an epic film I suppose, but in other places there is just way too much talking between mundane characters, i had to skip it, it was just so BORING. It honestly seems like a history show sometimes, maybe it will pick up and get better, the trailer is impressive, but getting through some of the first 2 episodes is.....painful in places, why do I have to write so much, some times i see reviews that are 100 characters long, how is that happening? I wish this was like that, oh Anna Sawai looks beautiful in the show, better than in godzilla. Which hmm was also mostly boring !",7
"She-gun - Absolute Rubbish","*** This review may contain spoilers ****Plot and ending analyzed*It seems that the producers hired the most annoying, uncouth, asinine, and boorish Englishman that they could find. Where did they find this guy? At the taverns? At the docks? All he does is curse and curse. In reality, no Japanese feudal lord would put up with his outbursts. This bloke is so bloody over the top ridiculous and insane that it really ruined the fine acting from the Japanese actors. His acting is so wooden, and he doesn't inspire any sympathy at all. He is a loudmouth braggart. If you are a stranger in a strange land, it probably would prolong your life to keep quiet and assess the situation. But this guy, he is a bombastic vulgarian. Why the Portuguese rogues or few Spaniards did not toss him into the tides is beyond me.Another major problem was that one of the writers was a woman, and it looks like they let her inject some modern day extreme feminism in many of the action scenes. There's a household maid that starts killing everyone with a knife and they made it look like she was unstoppable. The attack in the forest scene had the Japanese woman translator pick up a spear and hack about five Japanese soldiers with ease. It was absolutely stupid. That completely ruined the decent dramatic scenes. I am sure that she will be fighting samurai in the later episodes. And what did the Englishman do during the attack, did he pick up a sword himself? Nope.And the English steersman is supposedly speaking Portuguese while we are hearing English? Okay. While he does not know a word of that language? The script continuity supervisor completely failed the audience.Not to mention that the writers are vehemently anti-Catholic and despise the Portuguese and Spaniards while favoring the Dutch and English.And the idiotic scene with the boats and ships? Utterly unrealistic. Preposterous. This is the type of dumb things that we are forced to sit through, cartoon fantasy scenes.The English steersman was supposedly starving and had scurvy on the long trip to Japan, but when he took off his clothing to swim, it appeared that he had been at the gymnasium recently.And as usual, they made the Japanese translator very beautiful. She can not be fat or ugly. How is that for the double standard? On the one hand, women can fight exactly like men, but then they have to look beautiful. Hypocrisy.Episode four was just dreadful. Apparently, the English steersman, who said he knew nothing of military tactics and expertise in the previous episode, is an artillery genius in this episode. And he trains a few Japanese soldiers, making them experts as well. Seventeenth century artillery guns were unwieldy and difficult to shoot accurately. In a highly preposterous scene, the new Japanese artillery men make waste of some enemy horsemen from 1000 yards out. And the general, whose limbs are all bloody and absent, mutters that it was not honorable behavior. All that because some impetuous young son wanted attention.The English steersman, who in previous episodes is made out to be a devout Protestant, sleeps with a Japanese prostitute, and he is married. More hypocrisy. And there is more foreshadowing that the Japanese translator may be a key to the future. I personally think that she may be a trained assassin who has a shady past, and will kill the enemy lord. If that is the case, this whole series is a complete farce. The episodes are getting progressively worse and worse.Episode five is more of the same haggard storytelling, which in this case, amounts to more of the same nonsense from all the previous episodes. There is some uninteresting balderdash about a dead chicken pheasant that is ""not supposed to be touched"". The Englishman was jokingly saying that anyone who touched it would be killed. Turns out, the gardener touched it and was put to death, and the Englishman is wondering why. His empty-headed buffoonery is getting tedious.Then the husband of the Japanese translator has ""miraculously"" returned alive. Apparently, he and ten unemployed samurai fought off those hundred soldiers. Okay. Whatever. Well, the writers put him through the sewer in this episode. They made him more unlikeable than Genghis Khan. He can not hold his Japanese liquor against the Englishman, but he still is an expert marksman with a bow and arrow.They also put out the expected female victim card for the Japanese translator, so that the audience can weep and instantly side with her. Except it was done in a horrible manner, so to an educated viewer, it looks entirely contrived.More contrivance is included later when the lazy writers throw in an unexpected earthquake. The laughable scene is so utterly inane that you have to see it to believe it. I'm sure they will also include a tsunami in the following episodes.I don't think that the series will improve much. But I'll still watch it to the end. Like a man on a sinking ship.Hopefully a few good things will come from this pathetic and pitiable series. Japanese mom and pops restaurants will have some business, people will buy some Japanese history and art books, and that they will also look to the past for the excellent Japanese film directors, who include Akira Kurosawa.Stick with the original version and the book itself. This version is useless and horrendous. A complete waste of time.Thusly, after ten narrative episodes, we fundamentally are left with a meaningless and vacant ending and totally uninspiring conclusion.Final conclusion: Shogun (2024) is a vastly overrated series that has no redeeming value or qualities. It is empty and devoid of any sincere drama or proper human empathy, and it seems to rely on amoral characterization and extreme transitory story writing. The characters also lack clarity and compassion, and no chemistry exists between any of them on the screen.Final grade for series: D -",4
"Sumptuous production","Read this novel when it was first released and again decades later. I found the first television series with Richard Chamberlain a disappointment mainly because it shortchanged the Japanese characters this has been rectified spectacularly in this new adaptation. The production values are excellent and very much enhances the spectacle of the series. Having the main characters speak in the native tongue was an excellent decision on the producer's enhancement of the production. The only quibble I have with the production is the choice of the actor who portrays John Blackthorne he is very wooden and unconvincing both physically and dramatically.",7
"Overhyped . Overrated","By looking at ratings and reviews, I thought it must a great show. I gave it a try but then it has a slow pace so I thought "" good things takes time"" and kept watching. The story goes nowhere. The show explains vaguely about few characters through flashbacks. The projected protagonist substantially does nothing. It's a headache. He lets good people die for nothing. Nothing makes sense. Barely any mystery to reveal. The cinematography and theme will give vibes of Game of throne but it does nothing. I was waiting that since it has 8+ rating there must be something different and interesting event further in the show. But it goes nowhere.Save your time it will not give you any entertainment. When it ends you will be left with questions why I watched it at first place.",5
"Extremely shallow","Sadly the excellent decoration is met with mediocre writing and brutal bad playing. The inability to grasp the hidden message, strange narrative just ot make thing clearer for a lazy brain. It is far away form the mystique, elegance and internal conflicts of the 80's series. The behavior is fully Americanized , the Japanese orientalism is fully depreciated. The actors play mediocre too, some lost their accent, some cannot grasp the internal conflict of the invisible. I was wondering why specific scenes are shoot just to make clearer what happens, where the master of the puppet will never have such conversations.",3
"A helpful review about english sub-titles and dubbing in 'Shogun'","Available on Hulu and FX, Shogun is an American production co-created by husband-and-wife duo Justin Marks and Rachel Kondo. The creators proudly used Japanese as the prominently spoken language in the show to enhance authenticity and they supplemented it with English subtitles, and dubbing (available only on Hulu). While I appreciate the dedication to authenticity, it's worth noting that many English-speaking viewers, myself included, find that subtitles and dubbing hinder the enjoyment of a show.For me, enjoying a show goes beyond its visual appeal and world-building aspects, although I do enjoy those aspects as well, and 'Shogun' has that in spades. I feel that appreciating the nuances of character conversations is paramount, and that gets lost with subtitles. Similarly, no matter how good the dubbing is, it always feels awkward and disconnected, taking away from being fully enraptured with the storyline. It's regrettable really, because the production quality is undeniably remarkable and I'm sure the cast is brilliant.It can't be understated enough that my preference against subtitles and dubbing is solely based on my personal entertainment experience and is not meant to offend anyone. It's just a matter of personal enjoyment. And isn't that what a television show is supposed to be about?",6
"do not believe","This is so Holywood...Watched 2 episodes, and will not be watching more. I am wondering why people thought of this show being authentically Japanese. On my mind, Tokyo Vice is so much more better in this respect. I did not read the book, I did not watch the 70th series, but this one is definitely not a piece of art. Despite all the costumes and excellent Japanese actors, whom I very much admire, this show feels superficial, with much cliche from Holywood-like acting and story-telling. I am a fan of Japan culture, but this ""creation"" has nothing to do with it, despite what authors/makers/some watchers may claim. Real sorry for the wasted effort, time and money.",2
"Only with sub titles","I tried to keep going for 20 minutes, but I just couldn't do it anymore. In the evening I want to relax and watch series without having to read subtitles all the time.Why has a language barrier been deliberately built in here, I just want to relax in the evening.You can't concentrate on the movie because you have to read all the time except when the Dutch and Portuguese are speaking, then it's in German, the rest is felt to be 99% in Japanese.Too bad, that makes the series unwatchable for me.Apart from that, I didn't think the picture on my 4k TV was that great either.Take it or leave it.",7
"Unwatchable","So disappointing.. I Subscribed to Disney plus as it is the only place this much anticipated series is available in UK ,only to find that it is too dark to see the action and the subtitles are too small and often disappear too quickly. On the face of it there would be much to enjoy with a far greater focus on the Japanese characters than in the original Richard Chamberlain version. Similarly the sets and costumes are far superior (what I can see of them) Quite why Disney Plus is so poor I do not understand. It is the same for Star Wars features - terrible picture. One can only hope that another streaming service or broadcaster will pick it up in time.",1
"Good show but one clear fault...","I only saw the first episode, and while it's generally very good, with good acting and a slow but engaging storyline, I have to point out one very obvious fault...It's obviously set in Japan in the 1600's, so the local characters speak japanese, and the foreign ship crew, a mix of dutch and english sailors speaking english. There's also spanish character that speaks with a spanish accent.So far, so good.The problem is the show has a lot to deal with the portuguese presence in Japan, and as such, several dialogues are supposed to be in portuguese, but in the show they're portrayed in english.I obviously know this is to create a better appeal to american and english-speaking audiences, but why do you have japanese speaking japanese, but no portuguese speaking portuguese?It can't state to be a grand production, with historically accurate costumes and storyline, and be so ""americanized"" at the same time!Other than that, I enjoyed the first episode and will probably follow with the next ones, though hoping there's a bit more action.",7
"Fairly bland and predictable","It's entertaining enough to watch, but the cheesy boat scenes, generally bland dialogue and typically convenient dramatic events leave it lacking. The acting is good for the most part, but some of it feels forced due to the ""language barrier"". I may be ""old man yelling at clouds"" but the ""white savior"" thing is generally a little hard to consider, especially how easily everyone is in awe and captivated by easy manipulation and this is coming from a middle aged white man. There are some moments, so I guess, watch it, enjoy it for what it is, but definitely a show that you won't feel guilty missing out on.",5
"Muddled Soap Opera With Swords-Inferior to 1980 Version","If you have seen the 1980 version, you don't need to waste time with this remake. The visuals may be stunning ala CGI, but there is so much wrong with this version. Cosmo Jarvis is not yet mature as an actor, and has one expression-bemusement. Richard Chamberlain, in his prime in 1980, was a much better actor and much better-looking. The plot gets mangled especially in episode 10, and the viewer is left wondering how the story wraps up.: It is not true to the book at all.It's a pity that this, like so many remakes and ""reimaginings"" (read: pale imitations of classics) only degrades the story, and it's amazing that the Shogun IP holders would approve it. In a few years hopefully Jarvis will have honed his skills and this waste of time will be a footnote.",1
"Disappointing Series: A missed opportunity","Title: ""Disappointing Series: A Missed Opportunity""As a dedicated fan of the genre, I was eagerly anticipating the release of shogun. However, after investing countless hours into watching it, I can confidently say that it fell far short of expectations.Firstly, the plot was convoluted and poorly executed. Instead of a cohesive narrative that drew me in, I found myself struggling to follow the numerous subplots that seemed to go nowhere. The pacing was inconsistent, with episodes dragging on without any meaningful development, only to rush through important moments later on.Furthermore, the characters lacked depth and failed to resonate with me. They felt like mere caricatures, with little to no growth throughout the series. I found it difficult to empathize or connect with any of them, which made it challenging to invest in their journeys.On top of that, the acting left much to be desired. Dialogue delivery felt forced and unnatural, making it difficult to immerse myself in the story. It was evident that the actors were struggling to breathe life into poorly written lines, resulting in performances that fell flat.Lastly, the production quality was subpar. From the mediocre special effects to the uninspired cinematography, it was clear that corners were cut in the production process. Scenes that were supposed to be climactic fell short due to lackluster visual effects, leaving me underwhelmed and disappointed.Overall, shogun was a missed opportunity. With a more coherent plot, well-developed characters, stronger performances, and higher production values, it could have been something truly special. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver on almost every level, leaving me feeling like I wasted my time.",1
"No A spectacular movie for Japan history","This movies is widely talked about and I understand historical to an extent. But the directors of the movies is now becoming greedy. In the sense that there much space in-between the movies. The want to make money from stretching the movie. Under normal circumstances base on the trajectory of the movie, the season 1 should have ended at episode 8. There directors of the movie didn't do a good job, there was no expertise in it. Also the actors didn't act well. I understand that it is a historical movies, so therefore the storyline cannot be changed but the action scenes were not properly acted. I like the storyline.",6
"Shogun is the new Roman Emperor for Sigma Bros.","Good novel , horrible adaptation for sigma bros.Worthless modernized dialogue.I sat quietly while my roommate played this crud in the living room.But the line uttered after an Earthquake tremor made me write this review.The non Japanese looking girl with heavy cosmetic surgery uttered such a dumb line that their buildings go up as quickly as they go down.Nope that started happening in the midpart of 20th Century.Garbage writing with violent and overly seggs-ual plot.Only angry types of men would enjoy this series.Probably a good reason to think if they're right for you. If you enjoy things Japan, watch the stellar Tokyo Vice instead.",6
"An original and interesting story worth watching","It is the ancient and feudal Japan in the era of the Discoveries. There was a huge effort on having the show speaking Japanese, with Japanese actors and sets that turn the story very authentic. However, as Portuguese, I was expecting to see the same effort, since in the show the Japanese are trading with the Portuguese; but no, not even a Portuguese word is spoken even though they are supposedly speaking Portuguese. So, since the protagonist is English and speaks Portuguese, all those dialogs are in English or Japanese, affecting the comprehension of the story. They should have done the same as in Vikings, an excellent reference they should have followed: at least some dialogs should start in Portuguese so that the story could be better understood. Also, there are some twists and details that make the understanding of the whole plot a little hard. Even though it is a show worth watching.",1
"Is this ratings true!","Really!Could be ended within 2 hours with better ending instead all boring conversations!Exaggerated glorification of empty characters, contrived dialogues, and faces that do not look at each other during the dialogue.Even the one who prays may speak faster than these actors! With all this false suspense, I was expecting a greater ending.The captain's actions are often exaggerated and he is not aware of the seriousness of his situation and that he could die at any moment!The entire atmosphere is unnatural and the studio lights are clear, which indicates an unprofessional industry.Don't waste your time.",7
"I wish there was a trigger warning!!","Consider this a TRIGGER WARNING!!In the first episode a baby is killed. I wish so badly I had know this. As someone who has a baby I found this to be deeply upsetting and I had to stop watching.If I had know I wouldn't have started watching, or I would have skipped that part. You don't see it but what you do see is the mother holding the baby and her absolute anguish. It was heartbreaking and I cried a lot. I'm not saying these stories can't be made or told, I just wish there was a warning. Especially on Disney+ where I watched it. I spent the rest of the night crying, it was very painful as i had experienced loss a few years back.It's a shame because I really liked it up to that moment. It looks to be such a good series. So please, if you have experienced loss like this please be careful.",2
"Cultural Dissonance: Lost in Translation","The remake of the 80s series ""Shogun"" presents a compelling portrayal of feudal Japan, yet falters in its casting decisions. While the storyline remains captivating, the actor portraying Blackthorne lacks the depth and authenticity of the original.My main issue with this series is cultural representation, notably in its depiction of Portuguese characters. Despite every other actor (Spanish, English or Japanese) speaking their native languages (a hurdle to keep up sometimes), the Portuguese speak English. A terrible portrait of what was the biggest empire of the time. Additionally, the cultural mismatch detracts from the overall immersion of the narrative.",6
"Looks like The last samurai to me.","I like this kind of miovies and series. So I was very pleased these episodes scored very high on IMDb. So I had to watch it.For me, after watching the first three episodes, this is a no go. It looks very much like The Last samurai, although the Samurais are replaced by Shoguns. There is a white fellow who gets captured and learns the way of the Shogun. Similar story, stretched out over many episodes, does not have the heart and soul of The last samurai. But still manages to get a higher score. That's strange.So Hiroyuki Sanada has played in both as well; Shogun and The last samurai. But in Shogun he is the leader of his tribe and his part is played by someone else. Tom Cruis has been replaced by an other white guy and that's it.What disturbed me the most is that there is a lot of talking going on. During the talking, a younger man gets emotional and shares his anger in front of everyone. By doing so, he says that his bloodline will end. And so it happens that his ashes and the ashes of his baby ends up in two doggy bags for his wife. That did not make any sense. Cutting his thumb off would have been enough.",1
"People didn t read the book","I don t understand how so many are saying the storyline is accurate. IT IS NOT!Toranaga is skinny instead of fat. BlackThorn doesn t like like a sailer AT ALL not does he speak like one.Everything is fast forward...one event after another without a link between them.Nice they speak japanese but that s it.I love Shogun but somehow I m not having a good time watching this show. There many flaws.I also don t understand why my review has to be sooo long in order to be accepted.There are only 3 episodes out. What more can I say???Nebdjdjfjjfjfkcjjccdjxjxjxjcjcjcjjcjcjjdjsjdjjdjdjdjjdjdjdj.",7
"Good with two distractions","Good remake. Solid acting in the first two episodes. The vibe/atmosphere is close to the 1980 series. Maybe a bit toooooo dark. Listen: This is no suspense thriller or horror flick.The story is not as deep as I remember the book but good enough. If you want to dig deeper - enjoy the read.More Downsides:
Stupid blue contact lenses of Cosmo Jarvis and the extensive wide angle fish with bent doorframes, trees, et cetera pull me out of the experience.I also ask myself what made them choose van Tulleken for the first two episodes. I wished they had chosen someone who understands their craft better.Character development takes some shortcuts - especially for Blackthorn. Also, the relations of characters are not explained well.",5
"Good but could have been great","Good Jidaigeki tv-showBut I'm surprised ð® that there are no negative criticism. Are people just happy that they didn't woke the show up (lol)First of let me start with everything I enjoyed about the show ðThe acting was great all the lead actor's did a outstanding job. The dialogs were interesting the storyline obviously was great to . The clothing seemed correct with the timeperiod, there was enough suspense to keep you watching for most of season 1.Now I don't compare this show with the original. I have watched this as if I never seen the O. G version. And I wanted to see more variation in this version and that were my negative criticism starts .In my opinion the show lacks battle scenes, and the obvious lacking of the battle (war ) of sekigahara yeah I know the O. G version didn't show the war either but that's why I was hoping this version would be different , but they kind of just mixed copy pasted and changed a little bit here and there ð .The show screams for more episodes or seasons ð¤ even if the finale answered everything in the dialogs and little time jumps .So long story short, great Jidaigeki time period political drama .But it lacks episodes and action.",5
"Ruined by pretentious language barrier","I really enjoyed the pilot ( 1st ) episode and gave it an 8. It became a downward spiral to a 5 at this point despite Hiroyuki Sanada trying to carry the series. He was amazing in The Last Samurai. Shogun failed completely to capture the nuances of Japanese culture that ""The Last Samurai"" perfecly did in a 2.5 hours movie. The writing has become terrible with useless subplots that don't really add up much other than as plot convenience/hole and shock factor.The cheesy long dialogues and quotes with the monotones are painful to hear. The worst element in Shogun is the language barrier where an unfit tryhard lead actor - Cosmos Jarvis - who needs a babysitter to make corny jokes between serious translations. If i was a Japanese, i would be insulted and ashamed as to how this series treats the Japanese language. Why would the series use cheap humor through a language barrier? How did this infantile, Cosmos Jarvis, even made through the audition? I'm dropping this series for good.",3
"Great looking show, kinda going off the rails though","I love the look of this show. It's moody, it's dark, and while the landscape is not quite Japan, the Canadian wilderness is a decent analog. But looks can't carry everything, and the cracks are starting to show.The shogunate depicted is based less in history, but rather the obsession with a stoicism Western audiences associated with Japan during the early 20th century.The audience insert (notably British) is set up to see straight through this, and brings his enlightened views to the town he is gifted by Toranaga. It's a classic story as old as Hollywood, and it saddens me to see this trope rehashed time and time again.Perhaps it's that almost every Japanese character seems to be like some kind of cheesy anime character, either stoic, a buffoon, or a cackling villain. What little we see of the average worker is sweet or placid, a wallflower for Blackthorne to bounce off of in his classic rejection of stereotypical cultural tropes.I'm not asking for much, perhaps a little bit of insubordination. Because this period of time in history books was full of people breaking the mold in Japanese society. A mildly outspoken commoner, perhaps an unruly peasant. Just something to show that people were still people.Anyway, it's a nice looking show, and a little better than the days of movies like The Last Samurai. But it's got a long way to go, because the reliance on common stereotypes shows the lack of passion to depict people in a realistic and human way.",1
"Started off good","But then:Lots of setup with nothing actually happening laterLots of characters who I didn't care for and too few I cared forLots of talking. During the 10 hours I watched the show, I saw perhaps 20 minutes of what could be called actionLots of filler... just TOO much. Breaks between dialogue, dialogue moving in snails pace, blank stares at the camera...Lots of unnecessary drama between minor characters which leads to nowhereIts been a while I've been this disappointed in a show after a promising start. After the first 2 episodes I was ready to give this 8/10, but by the end, the best I could give this is 3/10, and that's for the beautiful scenery and OK-to-good acting, but its safe to say that nobody made any breakthroughs here.All in all a major disappointment, and to think I was ready to subscribe to Hulu just to watch this!",1
"I'm confused","As someone with PhD of art and working as writer and developer for several video games and movies I whould say it was a waste of time and budget,the only thing that I liked was the close ups everything else was awful such as character development was meaningless story line was boring the acting could have been much better and everything else,it was an example of what path the art of movie making should not continue to take,if the series were to continue for another 20 to 30 episodes you may see some good points in the story,which hopefully it didn't continue that much and our time wasn't wasted more than this.",3
"No Portuguese? Seriously?","The Portuguese speak English. Who in 2024 and in their right mind thought that this would be a good idea? Therefore the whole series is a complete clown show. It further presented in the so far published episodes a lot of flaws and illogical behavior of the characters. The story is simplified, rushed and takes stupid, unbelievable short cuts. Acting isn't that great and I cannot sense any chemistry, whether good or bad, amongst the characters, but that's probably due to the lazy script and directing. Cinematography is uninspiring and once more: who thought filming all in Canada would provide an ""authentic"" backdrop. Japan is beautiful and the film makers missed a great opportunity here. Because all of this, all portrayed feels unauthentic. Poor cast and characters. Most annoyingly Blackthorne, representing ""the English"", is just a Marty Stue, which is so utterly boring.These 10-point reviews seem fake in their vagueness and majority as there's no way that this cheap, lazy production is above a 7. IMDB is losing credibility here.I still cannot get over the fact that in the year 2024, they replace one language by English. This is extremely irritating, disappointing and blatantly ignorant and embarrassing. I'm not gonna watch more what these people create in the future. Ridiculous.",6
"Disappointing","The caliber of the production is far above average and from viewing point of view was a real treat visually To my mind the storyline wanders from the novel and is confusing. The confusion is due in large part to the use of captions In my opinion the biggest disappointment was the use captions on the Japanese dialogue. The captions turned off people. Considering the amount of money spent producing this series why wouldn't you give the viewer the option to select language as does Netflix on foreign.films. When it's possible to offer different language why would you not? Cast was excellent. All things considered, a lost effort.",1
"What a bore fest glorifying suicide and treating women like cattle in the name of history","As an avid fan of Chinese and Japanese movies and TV shows, I was very excited to see this show prop up. Excellent ambience and acting. However the story lets you down considerably. Pointless and just like the famous Heroes and other similar movies. To top it all it glorifies suicide in the name of honour and treating women like 2nd class citizens.In this day and age, such shows should not be made that glorifies things it took us years to leave behind. The end is so simple and ridiculous which could have been achieved without getting so many people killed. The good part of that the lead actors are amazing. However, once you finish the show you would think why did I waste 500hrs of my life on this show.",3
"NOT ENTERTAINING because of poorly shot scenes and massive number of fast subtitles","1. COLORS: Poor choice of colors and too many blurry out of focus misty background scenes. Even the indoor scenes were terrible. For some reason inside is a misty mess and background totally out of focus. Very unrealistic lighting and colors and very distracting.2. MUSIC: Just didn't go with the scenes. It was ........ I don't know what it was.3. SUBTITLES: Too many, too fast and too many unfamiliar names. My wife and I could not watch it together because both of us had to rewind at different times just to try and figure out what was going on. If you watch the actor's expressions you miss the subtitles and rewind, rewind, rewind.4. COMMERCIALS: I was going to join Hulu so I wouldn't have to watch commercials. Fortunately, I decided to watch it on FX first to see how I liked it. I won't be joining Hulu or for that matter I have no desire to watch another episode. Yes, too many distractions.5. ACTING: We were spoiled by Richard Chamberlain and John Rhys-Davies (actors in the 1980 much better version). Current actors don't even come close. Shame
6. STORY: I love the story, it is amazing. Unfortunately, there are too many distractions to enjoy the story.7. SCENERY: I lived and traveled all over Japan for three years. I don't know where this was filmed but for sure IT WAS NOT IN JAPAN......AT LEAST MOST OF IT. Maybe that is why a lot of the outdoor scenes were misty/hazy and out of focus.8. RATINGS: IMDB currently gives it a 9.3. It's only been out three days. Take a guess who gave it all those high ratings! I give it a ""one"" because of all the distractions.ALL I CAN SAY IS .......WHAT WAS THE DIRECTOR THINKING?????",1
"Not as good as the original","I've watched the original mini-series and have read the book twice. I'm more a fan of the original because it included narration for context. I find myself reading captions at the bottom of the screen instead of enjoying scenery or the actors. I'd re watch this series completely once I get through all episodes. I might even purchase the original with Richard Chamberlain. This review is much longer than it needs to be because there's a six hundred charactor minimum. A feature that is completely useless and unnecessary. So I keep trying and trying but it won't let me submit it. Nope, just tried again but it's not happening.",5
"Doesn't follow the Book","This remake of Clavells Shogun is inferior to the previous incarnation with Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune is every way. In the first Mini Series the writers followed the Novel exactly all the way through. In this version they deviated, beginning with Rodriguez going overboard, and then washing up on an Island, found and rescued by Kasigi Yabu after he washed up on the rocks.Then when Toranaga puts Blackthorne in prison, he meets Friar Domingo, who very briefly tells him of the black ship but not it's importance and the writers leave out all the detail and his learning Japanese is left out completely. The way he leave prion is totally different and his instruction of Toranaga into the partition of the world by the Pope in the Treaty of Zaragoza is glossed over so quickly that it's importance on the story is lost. Blackthorne's desire to pursue the Black ship is lost. In the book that is the thread that ties the entire plot line and all the characters together into a wonderful novel. The assassin from the Tong that comes in the night is after Toranaga in the current version whereas in the Novel and mini series he, now a she, was after Blackthorne.",1
"Not great","Being a dedicated fan of the genre, my anticipation for the release of ""Shogun"" was palpable. However, my enthusiasm quickly waned as I invested countless hours into watching the series, only to find it falling far short of expectations. First and foremost, the plot proved to be convoluted and poorly executed. Instead of a cohesive narrative that drew me in, I found myself grappling with numerous subplots that seemed to lead nowhere. The pacing was erratic, with episodes dragging on aimlessly without any meaningful development, only to hastily rush through important moments later on. Adding to my disappointment, the characters lacked depth and failed to resonate with me. They felt like shallow caricatures, devoid of any meaningful growth throughout the series. It was a challenge to empathize or form any connection with them, which significantly hindered my ability to invest in their journeys. Furthermore, the acting failed to elevate the material.

With a more coherent plot, well-developed characters, stronger performances, and higher production values, it had the potential to be something truly special. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver on almost every level, leaving me with a sense of regret and the feeling that I had wasted my time investing in the series.",1
"Illogical language barrier","This is a show made for the American audience, and yet most of it is in Japanese with subtitles. However, the people speaking English are supposed to be speaking Portuguese, what kind of sense does that make?The original with Richard Chamberlain didn't have the type of cruelty that the first episode shows. I suppose that's because today's audience wants something much more edgy, but it certainly doesn't appeal to me.Because it's a saga with interesting costumes, and an interesting location, I imagine it will find its audience, but just a warning to those of us who liked the book and the previous series, don't watch this show.",2
"boring and pretentious","Very boring and pretentious. Lots of light flaring on lenses, I guess this is supposed to be atmospheric. If you took a few classes on photography, you'd soon find it's largely considered amateurish. The music is louder than the dialogue making it difficult to understand anything. Seriously, it's not that hard to balance the audio levels. Complete fail. It's a mish mash of history & fantasy, sorry but that's what it is. Lots of sub titles, why? When Europeans speak, it's modern English so why bother with Japanese. So pretentious. Pick a language & stick with it. It's either a Japanese film or an English film... NEVER both!The costumes etc are great. I'd prefer consistency to nice costumes & sets but who cares about that these days. Better to be pretentious and pseudo multicultural.So, if you are looking for some pretentious crap, this is the one for you.",1
"Really? They had no one that spoke portuguese?","This show had everything to be a great one, but putting someone speaking in english and calling it portuguese was the nail in the coffin for me.Portuguese is one of the most spoken languages in the world and they couldn't find someone that spoke the language?That's lazy and disrespectful to say the least.One of the main characters, Blackthorne, is also a terrible actor, he's a disgrace to the show, there are so many great actors that actually speak portuguese that could easily have done that role better than this awful guy.I'm disappointed with this and with the historical incorrectness too, Portugal never explored the Japanese, they were trading partners and friends, they should have read some books about it at least.Terrible!!!",1
"BlackthorneÂ´s acting is just offputting","And thatÂ´s that - the acting of Blackthorne is terrible, everytime he appears is horrible, it is cringeworthy. The japanese actors and actresses are great, the portuguese well...they could speak portuguese just like the japanese speak in their own language. I am watching just hoping Blackthorne dies soon.The setup, plot and storyline is quite good, but it is completely biassed so english appears to be good, and spanish and portuguese are the bad, when the real story is that piracy, dirty tricks etc have been always the trademark of the british. It is british propaganda on how good they are and how they rest of nations should be grateful that they are here.",1
"Calvell twists the facts to suit his ""british protestant hero"" narrative","I'm no fan of either (or any) religion, but the facts of what happened at this time have been twisted so much out of shape it makes it a pro british protestant, arrogant affair.Throughout history the british have been known (like many other empire driven nations) to twist the facts to suit their own agendas, the problem with series like this, there are enough idiots who'll believe this to be the truth. The theme tune for this should be ""Rule Britannia"", It's so pro-british it's unwatchable for me, and has all the usual cliques. I stopped watching halfway through the 2nd episode, read other reviews, read historical facts (and it's extremely inaccurate as far as what actually happened is concerned, which is why he's changed the names of all the main protagonists!), no surprise this was written by an ex british military buffoon...",1
"Just another piece of historical brainwashing.","Yet another play in which history is misrepresented, I would even say misled. Despite portraying the greatness of Japan, once again an Englishman plays a key role in the story. The Portuguese are once again portrayed in a position without any merit.Even the Spaniard is portrayed as a reckless and impulsive pilot, while the Englishman is the competent pilot who saves the boat.This is why the UK and the USA have culturally conquered the world, they have brainwashed people's historical memory.I don't have much more to add, I don't know why it has such a high score, the plot is nothing exceptional.Just another product driven by the powerful marketing of the film industry.",1
"Why is it shot like that?!","First episode has really turned me off from wanting to watch more.Why is this show done as if it's a horror movie? Weird fish-eye lense camera's, shake cam's, strange, dark atmosphere with horror movie music and characters doing lines like they're trying to be weird about it. Everythign is dark, rainy, misty, dreary as if it's all a vague, unnerving nightmare.This is supposed to be an adventure of discovery, of culture clashes, not this depressing nightmare.It's so...off, so weird.The old mini-series was fantastic. It had great and renowned actors, some of them movie legends like Chamberlain and Mifune. I'm sorry to say I know nobody who is in this show. All these plastic faces, perfectly sculputed by the best of cosmetic surgeons make these characters feel unreal and unnatural. They are too perfect, adding to it all an unauthentic feeling. They don't feel like regular people, they feel like beautiful, perfect actors.The direction is like a strange, ungodly mix of the worst overdramatized parts of both Western and Japanese movie-making. In the first episode, event after event just happens like ticking boxes on a list, it's so unnatural without any feeling of connection. That the scenes seemed to often be so short didn't help at all. Remember when lord Yabu gets introduced in the old mini-series? That's quite the scene. It's in no hurry. None of that in this new show, none of it, everything has to happen quickly and you never get to just sit and enjoy a long scene with good drama.The way the language barrier was represented in the old mini-series was very good, perhaps brought on by the fact that there was a genuine language barrier for the cast that made it all that more believable. They truly were a different class of actors.",1
"I really wanted to like but the writers and directors were too lazy with languages spoken in the show","Besides the numerous inconsistencies from the period of time which are disrespectful and fictional. The fact that the writers and directors decided to use Japanese and English but refer Portuguese as English was extremely confusing, I thought I had dubs on because it didn't make any sense. The show is either for Americans only or dumbed down, so many shows have 3/4 languages spoken and this show can't handle 2? And there are actors that do speak Portuguese? It became unwatchable after knowing that they only steered the series towards Americans. Terrible creative decision. Horrible boring series.",1
"Yawn... the perfect sleeping pill","Despite its aesthetic allure, the series fails to captivate, leaving me yawning and on the brink of sleep through the initial trio of episodes. The addition of more female characters, a boost in action sequences, and a decrease in the prominence of fighting would undeniably enrich the viewing journey. I doubt I'll continue watching as the risk of nodding off looms large.While I understand it's an adaptation of a book, I fondly recall the 80s version, which managed to keep me engaged throughout. Thus, it seems entirely feasible for this adaptation to achieve a similar feat without missing out.",5
"Absolutely n","I am a huge fan of the 1983 mini series with Richard Chamberlain. He absolutely was John Blackthorrne. This FX series cannot begin to compare. It is tedious to watch. I am just an hour in and am giving up. If I want to read that much, I will read the book. This version seems to augment violence for violence's sake. Catholic bashing too which never sits well. They seemed to make a strong point of that early on. Volume is incredibly low, many scenes seen overly dark. Not as sumptuous as the original. I had this set as a series recording and deleted it after an hour in. It is rare that I ever like a remake. I think the only one that comes to mind was the A-Team movie. I spent most of the hour I watched not being able to truly concentrate because I had to read so much. I normally do not mind subtitles but this was painful. No thanks. I will now go buy the original.",1
"Headline: 3rd review made and deletedm","I can't give enough praise for the production team. They were awesome in several ways. They went through 9 steps to get the script as authentic as it is. Right on!! It's great to see no cut corners! Usually, something such as time period languages don't receive much attention. However, there's no cutting corners with the script when 600 A. D. Japanese was researched in order to ensure that this Television Event contained an original and genuine quality to it. Unfortunately, this is where anything that was done correctly was finished with. Actually, I fail to see the point in going 9 long steps with various types of Linguists for a script in a FICTION story. What a complete farce. It should have been classified as a COMEDY. What a JOKE!.Didn't anyone explain to these 9 groups of Linguists that the entire show is FICTION???I guess someone failed to inform them. It's quite sad that this entire show didn't live up to It's expectations. Even though so many Japanese Language Scholars were involved (against their will). LOL. I only hope that production spends more time on making an interesting story vs perfection in the Language.",4
"Was looking forward to this story","Im a big fan of Japanese Arms and Armor, but this new story Im not.I tried to watch episode 1 and it completely failed for me with lots of fast small scenes.Lots of scenes was sooooo stupid that I took my self laughing. Why would a samurai risk his life for the Spanish guy? And then try to commit Seppuku and then saves him self when he get new rope. Sooo stupid.All acting is very poor and no one I care for.The music is soooo off.The guy playing Toranaga is sooo weak and not a good actor.All filmed in Canada with lots of CGI and green screen. Lots of closeup with blurry bagground.I was really looking forward to this new edition, but Im not gonna see the next 9 episodes, I cant take it serious.",1
"senseless gratuitous suffering","There is no value in portraying senseless gratuitous gory scenes of people suffering. It does not serve anyone, does not improve anyone's life, it just creates distress in anyone seeing it. We are empathetic beings and it is not normal to enjoy the suffering of others, in fact it can cause great distress in many people. I did not watch game of thrones for that very reason. Nor Braveheart. I stopped watching the walking dead when it went too far. I don't care how wonderful people may think the story is in this, so long as they decide it's appropriate to include stuff that I would not show to any child, then the show is surplus to requirements. Producers of these kinds of shows need to develop a sense of decency.",1
"Excellent series. Terrible actor.","This remake of the 80s series is excellent, but it has flaws in terms of the actors.Actor Cosmo Jarvis was poorly chosen to play the great character of Blackthorne, previously played by David Chamberlain. It lacks category, and the type of aggressive and proud representation is not even real compared to the existing novel.Yes, it's a 70s novel and it doesn't have the whole truth of the whole story. The pseudo adventures of a navigator named William Adams.And the biggest criticism is the lack of existing multiculturalism. If the series has Japanese actors representing historical figures from Japan, the same should happen with the Portuguese figures. We see Japanese being spoken, a sad and ridiculous speech in Portuguese that is in English. But then we already have an American speaking Spanish and a bunch of sailors speaking Dutch.I don't believe the series will correct or improve this issue.Keep watching...",2
"John Blackthorne speaks English not Portuguese!","As the title states, he speaks English not Portuguese. Along all the first episode the so called translators were tasked to translate Portuguese to Japanese, but the pilot (John) speaks English. Cannot understand why such a minor detail went unnoticed. Having that said, I couldn't continue watching as it was very disappointing that something so obvious wouldn't care for the producers. It's like insulting people's intelligence. If you manage to ignore and overcome that you might enjoy the series. It doesn't look so bad, but it's not amazing. I've got to watch the old though, based on some other reviews.",1
"Boring","I didn't see the original series in the 80's. I'm 40. I didn't read the book. Not my genre. However, I was looking forward to this and a new entertaining series for spring. Wrong. This show is an absolute snooze fest. My number one complaint is the subtitles. Most of the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. I want to watch a movie. Not read a movie. If I wanted to read a movie I'd get the book. Watched episode one figuring it would improve. As episode two ended I realized it was again full of subtitles and I had slept throw 1/3 of it. None of the characters are likeable. Its just overall boring.",3
"Grim, terribly cast, what accent is he going for???","I had high hopes for this but it's all dark grim dirty and that lead, is he going for British accent, Portuguese? Dark and grim and the cast is ugly. The male Japanese lead is so tiny, he doesn't command the power as a leader. And yes I get it, they're in Japan. But this is meant for Japanese audience or for North Americans. Reading the subtitles gets cumbersome. Feel like a foreign series,
The female lead is also ungrateful, speaks commonly and has zero star power. I get it trying to make it all authentic and realistic but as an audience I want to be entertained and all I see is dark grim unattractive people and nobody smiles. It gets tiresome just sitting through one episode. Sorry it's a pass for me.",2
"Torunaga didn't even exist, portuguese people do not deserve the treatment they have.","I'm not in favor of cutting creative freedom, but selling a period film with so many story inaccuracies (Torunaga didn't even exist...................... .......)
Then, combined with a total historical inaccuracy, the contradiction. On the one hand we have Japanese speaking Japanese, English speaking English and Spanish (Portugal's allies since when?!?!?) speaking Spanish. On the other hand, we have Portuguese speaking... everything but Portuguese.Finally, like the nail in the coffin, reinventing something is doing it better, especially when it is said to be the new Game of Thrones. The lack of a Portuguese character (who is empathetic to us) that makes up the chess game that was the Japan of Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu kills me. Now I understand what the Chinese and Russians feel when they watch American films...",1
"What a bore!","I've not read the book and I've not watched the original mini series so I have no legacy investment. I watched this mainly because of the trailers and because of Hiroyuki Sanada's presence. First, the sub titles and English masquerading as Portuguese, if this is your problem then maybe you need to have a word with your inner racist. The sub titles aren't a problem it just means you have to watch and listen rather than being on your phone, as to English standing in for the Portuguese that would have been spoken, well good luck finding the audience that will endure subtitles for both Japanese and Portuguese speech. No, the real problem with this is the unfathomable plot strands and the central notion of a washed up English trader/pirate being important in a Japanese clan war. Non of the plot makes sense and the script is excruciating and no amount of bowing and being inscrutable can save it. A number of the players will be familiar to western audiences, the aforementioned Sanada has been in a lot of western productions, Anna Sawai & Takehiro Hira are both in Monarch, Legacy of Monsters, and Tadanobu Asano has a number of western productions under his belt, so this isn't amateur night. Unfortunately their lines don't help them deliver a coherent story and Cosmo Janis as the white saviour 'lead' further hampers things with a fairly uninspiring performance. Only two episodes have dropped so far but they were enough, I'm out.On an historical note, in 1600 Spain & Portugal were one kingdom ruled from Spain and the threat to their trade came from the Dutch (it wasn't called Holland!) not England.",4
"Leave out the European bit","The sense of Japan , history and culture is excellent but ruined by the European angle and level of importance . That angle is the weakness and reduces the impact of the intrigue and chivalry of the clan history. Sanaa and sawai are brilliant and I loved every scene they were in but my enjoyment dropped when Jarvis as the English hero entered. Most in the west are unaware of the richness of the Japanese culture in the 17th century and this was an opportunity to explore same. I usually like dramas to stick to the book but in this instance I would have been very heavy for a heavily adapted screenplay.",4
"Respect Portugal and the Portuguese language","Having a TV show in 2024 that is suppose to be full of people speaking Portuguese but all of them speak English is atrocious.I laughed so hard when a character said: ""Do you speak Portuguese?"" as he talks in English, I'm sorry, I just couldn't take it seriously.No wonder that Americans thinks the world resolves around them watching a series like this.The network and producers should respect Portugal, the country full of brave people that discovered by sea almost the whole world and also, the portuguese language, a language spoke by many today and a beautiful one.Skip this, if they do this with the Portuguese langague, I expect Darth Vader to arrive in episode 3.",1
"Shogun: A missed opportunity to show the richness of Portuguese culture","Lack of linguistic fidelity:
-Dialogues in English when they should be in Portuguese, compromising immersion in the story and cultural authenticity.-Incorrect pronunciation of Portuguese, with a heavy English accent that sounds artificial and even caricatured.-Lack of attention to linguistic details, such as grammar and vocabulary errors.Inappropriate stereotypes and representations:
-Portuguese characters portrayed in a negative light, as being ignorant, superstitious or violent.-Exaggerations and distortions of Portuguese culture, reinforcing pre-existing stereotypes.-Lack of research and historical accuracy in the representation of the time and events portrayed.Devaluation of the Portuguese language and Portuguese culture:
-The choice to make the series in English rather than Portuguese can be seen as devaluing the Portuguese language and culture.-The lack of care taken with the Portuguese language in the series can be seen as a lack of respect for speakers of the language and for Portuguese culture.-The series can contribute to the perpetuation of negative stereotypes about Portugal and the Portuguese.Conclusion:
-The Shogun series, despite having great production value, displays a disrespect for the Portuguese language and for Portugal. It is important to criticize the series for these problems and to demand greater quality and rigor in productions that portray Portuguese culture.",1
"Why always sex and nudity?! Ugh","Why can't anything be made without so much sex and nudity ?! This is a great show so far , but the women nudity is not necessary! I'm so tired of everything needing to have it . I don't mind if a show needs to show chemistry with characters but it's really not necessary here. Game of Thrones is disgusting as well . There is just no need for so much of it every single episode. Im disappointed. Was just wanting to watch this with my kid who loves this type of thing but with the nudity I hesitate. Yeah it can be skipped but I feel I'm so over needing to be careful. For once a decent show can be decent with NO NUDITY!! It's always women too . Ughhhhh , disappointed.",1
"Almost perfect, but...","Shogun is a great production with good actors, costumes, scenery, music, etc. A strong point would be its multilingual and cultural aspect, as the Japanese and English have their languages respected. It is unbelievable that the dialogues between the supposed ""Portuguese"" people are all in English, which often makes a scene incomprehensible, for example in E2, in which a Portuguese priest and Mariki ""translate"" a conversation with Blachthorne (who claims to be fluent in Portuguese) to Toranaga, but their ""translation"" is entirely from English to Japanese. In another scene, the same Portuguese priest, alternating between Japanese and English languages (with maybe an exagereted ""Portuguese"" accent), compliments Mariki for her ""excellent Portuguese"". Nonsense! It is not enough to avoid ""yellow face"" and other prejudiced aberrations and remain with this ridiculous language segregation. A shame.",5
"Portugal keeps being disrespected throughout the industry...","This show is a disgrace in the sense they could't even go through the troube of getting a portuguese speaking actor and constantly disregarded the language and its importance.I watched the first episode with high expectations given the rating only to be lef extremely disapointed by the end of it, frankly losing the will to watch any more of this garbage.I spoke about the portugese laguage's complete disregard but that was not my only issue of course, one could mention the historical inaccuracies, the uncalled for nudity (only to appear more mature), and the extremely corny and tropy opening.Once again about the disrespect towards the portuguese, not once during the first episode did I hear about a portuguese sailor, always talk about a spanish sailor in the portugese ships almost as if the portugese were so truly incompetent they could't even sail their own ships.Since you are willing to have a majorly japanese show marketed to a non japanese speaking audience the inclusion of portuguse speaking characters would not be against the ""no subtitles watchers"" since the whole show requires the damn subtitles!",1
"Annoying and overated","Two things. First. If the main characters is supposed to speak both English and Portuguese ... But speaks ONLY English ... What is the point of the story? Why is he not speaking Portuguese? Secondly, after traveling the oceans without any food or water for month, youbshould see his body. He must have kept all the food and water for himself, and he shouls be blamed for the poor health of his equipage.On top, everything is crystal clear, spotless and new. Because Japanese are know for their obsession of cleaningless. ClichÃ©.This serie is grotesque. Flirting with some cheap Telenovelas ... Next.",1
"it's not top, bad bad bad","Frustration is felt when watching a series like Shogun, when the expectation of finding a passionate narrative is quickly replaced by the discomfort caused by the disrespect for the Portuguese language.The great initial enthusiasm that arose when watching the first minutes of the first episode of the Shogun series quickly disappeared when I realized that the characters, supposedly Portuguese, were not speaking Portuguese. Instead, a version of the Portuguese language adapted into English was presented, with the characters communicating in English as if they were speaking CamÃµes' language. This serious linguistic flaw was a huge disappointment and ended up completely compromising my involvement in the narrative.",1
"All the subtitles gave me a headache.","Loved the 1980 adaptation. But I really struggled to watch this version. I am not a fan of subtitles as I find that too many give me a headache I also find that by having to read the subtitles that I am unable to properly view the scenes on the screen so because of this I will not be watching any more episodes.Many people have rated this program excellent but it's not for me unfortunately.I was looking forward to watching this so I am disappointed that it has not met my expectations.In fact it's an hour of my life I will not back.This is just the opinion of myself and my husband I hope that anyone watching it will come to their own conclusions.",2
"Too Much Reading","I can't exactly enjoy the scenes when I'm too busy looking at the bottom of the screen 60% of the time. The trailer was not like this.Other than that that it's fine. I love the protestant and catholic rift. I like the costumes and architecture. And I feel like I'm learning about japenese culture. I like fact checking after every episode. I learn a lot but it's just too much to digest. This show is too complicated and has too much talking in it for me to enjoy it with subtitles. Maybe if it was an action packed anime or a movie, but 10 hours of reading. Might as well just read the book! Too bad I was looking forward to it too.",2
"Portuguese Jesuits talking english!?","Disrespectful and disappointing!John Blackthorne and all of his translators speak English in this show! Even though they refer to it as Portuguese, which has caused some confusion.With so many great portuguese actors available.. As a portuguese guy that loves history I found this cringe and OUTRAGES. This director should be sues and stopped from doing more historical movies."" Portuguese was among the world's key languages in the 15th and 16th centuries, serving as the lingua franca in several regions, including in African and Asian countries. Portugal was ahead of all European countries when it came to maritime imperialism in the early 16th century, establishing commercial routes and colonies in North Africa, West Africa, South Africa, and the region that would become known as Brazil. The Portuguese arrived in Japan in 1543, and by the end of the century, both the Portuguese language and the Christian religion had been assimilated by many Japanese.""",1
"Rated by fans","I was invited to watch it with a whole advertisement on social networks. But after watching the first three episodes, I decided not to continue watching it. Because I feel that the children who have suffered for ten years voted for it out of excitement, not those who have been following the cinema for several years. All this advertising and noise for a scenario similar to the third-rate Korean series (jumong) with special effects that should not be at the level of a score above 9, but these special effects are fair in the range of a score of 6. The black army in the movie is very weak and amateur. I hope you will not be fooled by the score without technical support like me. The actual score of this series is 6.",1
"Ruined by modern moral decay","Could have been a great series on feudal Japan based on how much painstaking work they did culturally and visually. Unfortunately, they decided to ruin it all with unnecessary crudity and pornography. Many of the ridiculously crass statements the characters make would not have been uttered by people living that time period, even if they were sailors and soldiers. In terms of its treatment of Christianity, the show has a laughably inaccurate representation of what Christian missionaries would have been like. In fact, the show goes out of its way to have some characters insult Christianity in crass ways, presumably inserted just to appeal to the depraved modern juvenile audience the show is seeking to please. It's the same reason it includes explicit sex scenes. No reason to have them, other than to cater to perverted minds. This show would have been so much better had it been cleaned up like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. Instead, they decided to put one more nail in our culture's coffin.",3
"Made for A Japanese Speaking Audience","Being an FX show, I thought this would be for an english speaking audience. The small amount of english that is spoken in by british actors with strong accents. The rest is all Japanese with english subtitles. Why networks think we want to read TV instead of watch it is beyond me. If I wanted to read it, I would buy the book (which is always better than the movie or TV)! No matter how good the show is, many of us will not watch it due to the almost total subtitling. I didn't even get through half of the first episode, and like many, will not watch any more. Too bad that FX has so little regard for such a large portion of its viewing audience.",1
"Too much cruelty. Too much reading.","I was really looking forward to this show. The commercials made it look like a respectable portrayal of cultures and relationships. However, I couldn't bare to watch any more raw cruelty and let's be honest, I wasn't ready to read thru the entire show of subtitles like it's some obscure foreign film on Netflix. I tend to prefer shows that are more for a general audience, nothing extreme. But this show is exactly that. Extreme and hard to watch. Not a good choice if you just want to chill at home after work and follow a good story. Between having to read thru the entire episode and watching families be murdered and some dude get boiled alive, ummm no thanks. Back to Sportscenter it is...",3
"17 Minutes and not for me","I got 17 minutes into it and turned it off. This does look like it can be a great TV series, but it is not suitable for people like me who like to multitask while watching TV. I'm busy. I am working from home. I like watching TV shows in the background while working on my computer. If I like the show, I'll usually binge watch it again, like I did with Vikings. Even though I am working while watching TV, I can generally get a good sense for what is happening and can keep up with the show.However, Shogun is not for those who like to multitask. It requires intent watching because a good deal of it is not in English. I understand the creators want to keep authenticity, but I intentionally used the example of Vikings. Vikings was a great show, yet it was in English.Hopefully, I will be able to find it with English dubbed down the road, but to not have it in English from the get go seems silly. Anyway, I'm disappointed because it does seem like a good series, but I can't waste time reading subtitles. I envy those who have the time to do so.",2
"English or Japanese? So mediocre copy of game of thrones & Vikings","I was waiting for this so long and here it is the most mediocre show of the year. First of all it's a message between Japanese and English. All characters speaking Japanese . Only one character speaking English. I don't know how will this show survive in today's era. This was so boring , slow and mediocre. No big actors no big sets. Story is very boring and slow. Game of thrones will remain epic even now because it had large production values and character development. 8 more episodes to go and I'm out after watching just one episode. Thatswhy I don't trust shows nowadays. This was very overhyped.",5
"They are changing their dirty history","As a person, I criticize that I am against changing history. This series is in contradiction with the real history and it was made only for the show for the benefit of their own history,I am sorry for the country of Japan for producing/collaborating on this work You should not forget your history and display what you want your history to be.If we distance ourselves from reality, it is a good movie: The character selection is well done. If such a budget was used to make the truth, it would definitely be one of the best works In general, if we don't consider the reality, it can get a score of 8 out of 10 in the worst case But for now, this is the right.",4
"Why Portuguese doesn't speak Portuguese?","Really well done job, its a great TV Show... BUT what's really, really bothers me the text of being involved with the series and actors but the Portuguese aren't speaking Portuguese? Whaaaaaaaaaat ?The actors and cenography are amazing, but it's really confused the beginning, after the first boring episode it's really gets you into the stories....it's amazing to see how Japan was sophisticated and their culture are amazing and respectful.Overall super recommended TV show, really far Game of Thrones as many said.Cannot wait to see the end, hope the is no Danerys Targaryen killing everyone.",6
