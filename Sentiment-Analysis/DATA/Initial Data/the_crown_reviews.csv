"Brilliant","What can I say about The Crown that hasn't already been said? It's incredible! There are some that don't like it because they take some liberties with the story but overall it's pretty accurate, especially the first few seasons. You can tell the amount of effort they put into this show from everything from the writing, acting, cinematography, production, etc. All being as good as it gets for a television show. It chronicles the life of Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family from the 1940's to modern times. It gives you an inside look at the personal lives of the royal family including their romances and political rivalries. There's a reason this show has won so many awards and that's because it's brilliant!",9
"Brilliant","I have to be honest. I had refused to watch this show from the moment it was released. Being no fan of monarchies in general, or of the House of Windsor in particular, I wrongly failed to see the potential.But history always is interesting, especially when left in the hands of able writers and an absolutely spectacular cast. To a person, word for spoken word, I was drawn into this series headlong and found myself taken by this expertly crafted story.I love that the flaws and tensions that existed are exposed and leveraged. And I find myself reaching for the shelf and pulling out a book or two to refamiliarize myself with some event.In short it won me over and taught me a lesson or two in the process. What more can one ask?",9
"Brilliant!","The Crown is simply a brilliant piece of television. It's one of the most expensive shows ever made and you can tell because the production and attention to detail is amazing. I originally put off watching this because I thought it was a show aimed from women but I couldn't have been more wrong. It is for everyone! Even when they changed the main characters in Season 3 because of the time jump it didn't lose a beat. Both Claire Foy and Olivia Colman both lead amazing casts who all deserve all the praise this show gets!",9
"This is simply Outstanding","Every so often a drama comes along that takes away your breath. Sometimes that's subjective, other times objective. Dramas such as The Jewel in the Crown, The West Wing, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Downton Abbey, House M.D. have all stood at the pinnacle of television drama.The Crown is right up there at the very top. It is outstanding in every way: faultless. From brilliant dramatisation to acting to score to cinematography: everywhere you look it commands.Watch it. You won't regret it. You will remember one of those television 'moments' that come along all too rarely.",10
"A grand and epic story of a very young, brave and brilliant woman!","I just watched the first two episodes and I already am in love with the story and characters! The acting is excellent as well as the directing, story line, costumes, sets, filming locations and everything else that has gone into the making of this series. It is well written and filmed and I am looking forward to seeing the remaining episodes. I have always been fascinated with history and this series takes you back in time. It has such powerful emotion and a lot of surprises which held my interest tremendously. So far, the episodes I saw went by quickly with me wanting to see more. If you are a history buff or interested in the Royal Family, don't miss this! It is a down to earth version of their lives and responsibilities. And so far, there are many things I did not know or appreciate. Definitely a learning experience and thank you for such a beautiful story! This is an addition to my previous post- I am now on episode 9 and if there aren't any awards for acting, I will be extremely surprised. John Lithgow's portrayal of Winston Churchill is award winning as well as Claire Foy playing the Queen. All of the acting is superb in my opinion and I don't want this series to end...",10
"Acting at its finest","Where to start is very difficult when it comes to what I can only describe as an amazing feat of production and acting. The cast are absolutely outstanding and are nothing but professional.You can tell a lot of effort has been put into the research and accuracy of the story line. The attention to detail also has to be credited.I can't find a fault and believe me I've tried. Having watched previous biopics/Dramas regarding royalty I will have to put this at the Top and that is including The Queen which again I would rate at 10/10.In summery a must watch if you are looking for a great piece of production and a stimulating story line. I would recommend this to anyone.",10
"A Visual Stunner","Regardless of what you may think of the Royals Netflix has poured a ton of money into this exquisite production about the life of Queen Elizabeth. It is a show which requires fixed attention as things progress at a unhurried pace. The opening musical evolution is enchanting and never grows old. Actress Claire Foy is beautifully riveting in the role of Elizabeth; someone who wants to have a normal life and yet is made to feel her duty as Queen should be the highest priority. It has been suggested the Queen is warm, has a sense of humor, is compassionate and this portrayal conveys it. She is wise enough to realize she's going to have to forge her own way as those around her are stymied in their own limitations or ignorance. John Lithgow transforms into Winston Churchill and is equally stellar. Their scenes together are superb. If Peter Morgan's research is accurate I can fully appreciate how Princess Diana must have felt. The show is rounded out by a wonderful supporting cast. This show is my favorite Netflix production so far.",10
"First 4 seasons are superb!","The first four seasons were simply superb with some genius casting - and accents to boot. The likes of Claire Foy and Matt Smith gave the show its charisma, along with incredible actors such as Pip Torrens and Alex Jennings, etc.. All fears of Matt Smith departing were allayed when Tobias Menzies stepped into the Prince Philip role.However, Season 5 isn't quite on the money. Whilst the new queen is very good, and the Diana Spencer character unbelievably like the real Lady Di, Prince Charles is somewhat of a let down. He appears to have ditched his royal accent for that of a regular Joe. Dominic West might be conscious of portraying a crass caricature, but caricatures are what we want. Prince Philip is no longer on par either (was Charles Dance not available!?!) and James Hewitt appears to have been randomly chosen. The show is still very good, and the likes of Lady Di's character keep it together, but it's starting to feel like a BBC drama, which is a shame.",8
"Wow! Tremendous series and the period details are painstaking and luscious","I watched with bated breath as Olivia Coleman took over from Claire Foy. Coleman embodies a mature Elizabeth, one who is calcified into a Royal with a stoic countenance, dowdy wardrobe, and a hint of what the crown has given and cost her.What really blew me away was the lavish attention to detail and period. The public and private spaces are painted in luscious colors, the furniture upholstered with richly hued brocade (so are the women come to think of it). The salons and libraries decorated with massive wood furniture. It's not comfortable - you can almost feel the drafty cold circulating throughout the palace, but it is a showstopper. No wonder they wore wool sweaters and tartan wool suits while lounging about.",10
"Elegant, extraordinarily written and acted","Probably one of the finest series currently streaming, with breathtaking cinematography, well developed stories and character arcs, with an astonishing cast. Olivia Colman replaced the great Claire Foy with brilliance, and the whole cast does an excellent job at portraying the characters, both in seasons 1/2 and the newly cast season 3. The amazing thing about the show is that, at the same time, the stories and people are portrayed as epic and down to earth. Nuanced and extravagant. I loved every single minute of it and I hope it continues for a very long time.",10
"Beautifully made series","To be very honest, when a friend told me we should watch the crown, a series about Queen Elizabeth ll life, i was not excited, im normally not a very good person to start watching a new series. However, so glad i watched this. Me and my friend watched 3 episodes, and i watched the rest on my own, latter that day. The series is exciting, fast past, amazing cast, beautifully shot, beautiful costumes. Besides all that, The Crown , have made me look with another eyes to the royal family, specially Queen Elizabeth, to be honest i did not know much about her personal life . The series shows the struggle of the royal family, and make us realise they are all people in the end, with their problems and feelings. I truly hope they will make another season, to continue this extraordinary show. Thanks Netflix.",10
"Slick and well executed, the Crown is drama at its finest.","The Crown boasts no action sequences or big movie stars, and yet it is one of the most expensive shows of all time. Why? Because of the sheer attention to detail. Aside from the fully historically accurate costumes and locations, the show is just gorgeous to look at. The lighting, the cinematography, and everything else visual about it is on point. It's quite apparent none of that money went to waste.The show doesn't just look gorgeous, though. It is also compelling, well written, and well performed. In fact, almost every element is perfectly executed, which means that no single one stands out above the rest, but rather they work in harmony. And that is the show's greatest success; the fact that it all comes together smoothly into a neat, binge-able, high quality package.Mind you, the reason I enjoy the Crown so much is that I knew what to expect when I went into it. This is NOT a fast-paced, action-packed, edge-of-your-seat experience. It is a character drama about the royal family. It runs at a slow pace. Yet it is gripping all the same. That's why it is so good to know that Netflix made such a large investment in this series; they're taking chances and funding original and unusual things in an era when Hollywood is afraid to do anything that isn't already an existing intellectual property. I hope that the Crown blows up like Stranger Things. I hope it gets all the attention it deserves.",7
"Total hatchet job","The first four seasons were excellent. A measured portrayal of the royal family. The fifth season is a compete hatchet job. Imelda Staunton is completely unconvincing, and the characterisation of Charles doesn't sit well. Given the recent death of the queen, putting out something that will disproportionately affect how young viewers see the monarchy is a serious responsibility. Instead, the makers of this season have seized the opportunity to mix historical fact with complete fiction and share it without any form of caveats. I've no doubt that much of what is shown will be taken as gospel by those unwilling or unable to read past the political bias oozing from every frame.",3
"A Majestic series","By season 3, the series has kept a high level of professionalism, acting, and story even when they changed every single actor !! Such an extraordinary series !!",10
"Binge Watching after the Death of Queen Elizabeth 2","Queen Elizabeth 2 just passed away and I have been binge watching almost all of Season one in the past 2 days since she died, may she rest in peace.This is so good. I don't know how I missed it when it came out back in 2016, but I'm so happy to get to watch it on Netflix now.It is riveting, beautiful, and moving, and I'm so looking forward to watching the rest.It was moving, watching the king die on the show and seeing young Queen Elizabeth first starting out, when now in real life she has passed and her son Charles is now King and taking over. Gives a real sense of time moving on and stopping for no one.",10
"Brilliant TV","This is a great series, and for older Brits (Baby boomers), the historical significance is stunning. The first series of actors did an excellent job, and now we are into the second series, and the acting just got better and better!Olivia Coleman is brilliant, as usual. The episode on the Welsh disaster in Aberfan was so well done and very sad. I intend to watch this many times as it is of high quality. I wish all TV were this good and such a high standard.Binge it!",10
"Season 5 what a pity!","I enjoyed so much the previous seasons, so I had much expectation on the following one.They were fantastic because of the great script, marvelous acting from both Queens, scenarios, intrigues, etc. I could say that was my favorite show.But now, with season 5 I am quite disappointed: there is too much talking, there is not a dramatic crescendo, the characters are plain. Quite boring.Plus, Queen Elizabeth II has not much interventions in the plot. I understand that the season was filmed in a very touching and difficult moment, but she is not anymore central of the plot, Prince Charles is the one who's there. And he is not that an interesting character...",8
"s3 ep6 tywysog cymru","I never thought that I would feel sorry for Prince Charles until I watch s3 ep6",10
"Huge fan, but season 5?","What happened in season five?I'm 5 episodes in and they seem to have abandoned their format.Before it was real life historical events in Britain jusxtosposed against how the royal family was effected or involved.This tension created the drama.Without the historical Britain piece I am just watching boring, spoiled characters.The show really suffered this season.I was so excited for it. And it's just not the same show this season.Characters are ""all right"". But their plots droll on.There isn't enough to fill ten episodes.I'm not British, but it does sort of feel like an agenda.Or they over edited it after the Queens death so as not to ""affect her legacy.",8
"Losing its sparkle","The Crown (1-4) was truly excellent. A brilliantly casted, written set of episodes, dipping into the many historical segments that have fashioned the monarchy to where it is today. What makes The Crown so appealing is the casting and acting. But, Series 5 is such a disappointment. Over-acted, badly characterised, tooth-pulling episodes that lose the once excellent sparkle it had. There are moments of excellence. John Major, The Queen in particular are outstanding. But, there are too many 'lame' representations' and storylines that drag on. Let's hope Series 6 gets back to the recipe The Crown once had and the sparkle can return.",8
"What the hell happened to Crown?","So dissapoonted from the writing and acting in the new season! Whole episodes focused on not so importnat people or events rather than the royal family. So much worse than the previous 4 seasons where the focus was on the royal family. The new casting very dissapointing, Diana actress is dissaster! They picked a handsome actor to act Charles, you watch and you don't feel the character! Also, the appearances of random characters just to show some connection with the royal family, but this goes on for half an episode and you forget what you are watching I relly feel like I wasted my time to watch this season, I really hope that the last one will be better and in line with the first 4 seasons.",8
"Can't help it but I miss Foy","There are a lot of things i like with season 3. Most of it is good. The stories, the characters, the actors.Colman is a good actor, no doubt about it. She played the part really well.The problem for me is:Claire Foy played the part like she was born to do it. I've never seen anything like it on tv.20 hours of portraying Elizabeth II made Claire Foy the real queen in a young age for so many of us.And the fact is; Every actor who comes next needs to portray Claire Foy. Not The Queen.",6
"2022 season is awful","Could this season be any slower? They are trying to extend into another season with filler. The first episodes gave some momentum at the start, but has now descended into inane sidebars. Carriage riding...really?? The disappointments of love, stories told by the supporting characters for a whole episode? I'm so bored I can't go any further.Could this season be any slower?

"A fantastic portrayal of British Royal history","The Crown is one of the fascinating dramas I have watched in very recent of times. First off, the show itself is a bit slow paced but nevertheless, it generates enough amount of suspense over the episodes. The Crown may lack the twist and turning of events than many other historical dramas, but the flawless direction and impeccable acting of its actors do not allow its audiences get disappointed. Secondly, the grandeur of the show is something of a treat to the sore eyes. Netflix has not been so frugal in the making of the show and it has paid them off every penny. The costume and the furnishing of the show within are scintillating. Lastly, this show is a great history lesson for all the viewers, particularly the ones who are of younger generations. It is mostly based on true events, so that is indeed a stand-out fact of the show. Though there were some moments where it seemed a little bit exaggerated but considering its genre as a TV series, that is reasonable. The Crown has allowed its viewers to peek what lies behind the royal curtains and taught a significant truth that a royal born doesn't necessarily get to evade all the personal tribulations that all the other commoners go through. They share just as same values as the other citizens of the country.",9
"Season 3 is a bit of a letdown","While I loved the first two seasons, I'm a bit disappointed with season 3. I didn't find it as exciting and engaging as the previous two, and mostly I felt really... removed from the Queen. There were very few personal episodes and scenes that really centered around her. Sure she was on screen a lot, but mostly as a participant in someone else's inner/outer conflicts. What I loved so much about the first two seasons was how much we got into the Queen's headspace, her struggle with her role, her sister, her husband, how she was trying to find her footing with government officials, as a woman, as a queen, etc... Now my feeling was that she really 'managed to disappear while wearing the crown', as Margaret had put it.
My other main issue was of course the replacement of the whole cast. Initially I was very disappointed that we're going to lose Claire and Matt and Vanessa Kirby, all of whom I had grown very much to love in their roles, and they were doing phenomenal jobs of course. Then I was a bit excited seeing all the great names involved, I love and respect Olivia Colman, Tobias Menzies is an incredibly colorful actor, Helena is one of my favorite actresses since Fight Club, and I love, worship, adore Charles Dance of course :) It was also interesting because I never watched a show before where the entire cast was changed between seasons. But sadly, I don't think this experiment worked. They all did very remarkable performances, Tobias Menzies was in particular very good as-Matt Smith-as-Prince Philip, but none of this seemed to matter. I kept missing the original cast. I couldn't drown that little twinge of constant disappointment when I saw Olivia and not Claire. When you put a character into an other actor's body, it simply isn't the same character anymore, and the wonderful first cast was a very big reason in us all falling in love with The Crown.
It also irritates me, because we didn't even jump that much ahead in time yet. They could have easily aged up the actors a little, a lot of shows have actors playing decades younger/older characters then themselves. With a little makeup and styling and practical effects they could have easily sold us the original actors as older versions of themselves. Instead everybody felt way too old all of a sudden, particulary Lord Mountbatten, who was a man in his prime and now is suddenly kind of ancient. And why did they have to reacast Michael Adeane, who was oldish to begin with? I didn't even know that was him (and Charteris) until some stray subtitle gave them away.
And I know it's a small and probably silly thing to mentoin, but the eyecolors of the new Queen and Margaret bothered me more and more with each episode. I got so used to those striking blue eyes, that their new doe-eyedness jolted me out of the story even more.
The show is of course still top-quality television, the aforementioned mistakes and faults notwithstanding, but once we're given perfection we'll expect perfection and season 3 fell short for me in that regard.",8
"Please remake Season 3","This show ticked all the boxes in seasons 1 and 2. The change of cast spoilt it for me (much like my fellow reviewees). I would totally love to see season 3 remade with the original cast.",8
"A Truly Masterpiece! Royal as it must be!","The Crown is almost one of the best period movies ( or better say, series of movies ) ever made. It defines the quality of historic period film making with every aspect. The casting is superior, the cinematography is outstanding, the thoughtfully written script just fixes you to the chair and you cannot stop yourself for several hours to watch it through. I personally watched it all twice to digest all the details prepared for the audience. I must admit The Crown easily made me a Netflix fan & a paid member after a quick glimpse at the trailer. A fortune is spent but worth every penny. Thanks to the producers, the amazing directors and the wonderful cast.",10
"Series 3 Concerns !!","The Crown series 1 & 2 is an outstanding production with outstanding actors that respected how important their part for "" The Crown "" was, however I cannot understand why they are changing the actors for the third series. This I fear is a very bad move Clare Foy and Matt Smith and other close relative's should have just aged and because of this may be a major error to the production and loose the audience . I wil always see this as a documentary because of the brilliant costly research that went into this. Well done Netflix producers for an outstanding production so far.",10
"Season 1-2 is still the best","Season 1-2 was perfect, but major casting mistakes were done in season 5. I've grown to like Imelda Staunton as the Queen although her performance seemed a little insincere. I normally really adore Lesley Manville but she's totally wrong to play Princess Margot. Her accent and her demeanor is all wrong for this role. But honestly, the worst casting mistake was Dominic West. Dominic West was Dominic West. He failed to transform into King Charles as the previous actor did. Other reviewers are all complaining about Debicki and the actor who plays Prince Phillip, but I liked both of them. They were definitely better than West.The episode in season 5 that highlighted the last moments of Tsar Nicholas's family was very spot on. A lot of people don't know that the Bolsheviks murdered their family in cold blood, raped the young princesses's and buried them like animals. Bringing awareness to this historic horror was important and well done.",8
"I miss Claire Foy","It's good, but I'm still adjusting t Olivia Colman as the Crown. Season 3 was just nit as exciting to me. Is still a great show though",9
"Engrossing highlights of Queen Elizabeth II's reign","The crown depicts the highlights of Elizabeth II's life from just before she became queen through the vicissitudes of being the symbolic head of one of the world's most powerful nations. Just a young married mother when she ascended the throne at age 25 in 1952, she survived one prime minister after another, family scandals that rocked the world and tragedies both national and personal. Her marriage with Phillip of Mountbatten, while rocky at first, became one of the pillars of strength which she leaned on.Through it all, Elizabeth remained ever aware of her divinely-anointed responsibility to put the well-being of the crown above everything on earth, even above her family and herself. And this is one aspect of the British monarchy that I find most admirable, even relevant - how monarchs like Victoria, Elizabeth I and Elizabeth II take their duty to the crown utterly seriously. One of the coronation rites mentioned in the drama was the anointing of Elizabeth as queen. This part of the ceremony is not shown to the public and was not shown onscreen. But it greatly intrigued me because of how powerfully it seemed to have affected the monarchs, making them faithful and dedicated to the crown. If only all heads of states around the world are as serious and dedicated to their duties!The drama is well directed and acted. It is reported to be among the most expensive TV series and it shows. The quality of production is top-notch.",9
"Season 5 Letdown","I loved every minute of the series until season five came along. The actor playing Prince Charles looks nothing like him physically, in demeanor, as well as body language, speech and movement. The woman playing Princess Diana is mugging in the worst possible way by straining her neck downward and pushing her eyes upward constantly. It is painful to watch! She also towers over all the other actors in every scene to a distracting level. How could such a fine show have such terrible casting choices? I've watched the first three episodes, and they all have stories that really go nowhere and seem to addresses side issues that barely pertain to the royal family at all as in past episodes. Previous seasons, placed the activities of the royal family in the context of larger historical movements in this season, seems to have a little interest in that. I'm sorry to say this series has ""jumped the shark"" as they say.",6
"The Crown: Grotesque","PlotFollows the political rivalries and romances of Queen Elizabeth II's reign and the events that shaped Britain for the second half of the 20th century.CastClaire Foy, the always excellent Olivia Coleman, Imelda Staunton, Matt Smith, Jonathan Pryce, Dominic West, Helena Bonham Carter and more.VerdictI was never going to like The Crown, it stood no chance, absolutely no chance in the slightest. The very concept is offensive, the woes and plights of these types people? Are you kidding me? I have about as much empathy as I do when Kim Kardashian loses her 15th ivory back scratcher.This is not entertainment, it's obscene.RantsOverpaid actors playing offensively overpaid individuals within a societal structure that simply shouldn't exist anymore! It's ironic, and absurd. It's 2024, how is the monarchy still a thing? You do remember the purpose of it right? Why it was created? What their jobs were? Now look at modern society, note that they don't need to do any of those jobs anymore as they've either been delegated or simply aren't required in this age. But we keep paying these people offensive amounts for doing literally nothing. It's insulting, people literally choosing between keeping the lights on and putting food on their table while these people have piles of money added to their piles of money which they couldn't begin to spend and all for accomplishing absolutely nothing. It's sick, it's perverse.The GoodAn impressive lineupThe BadNo entertainment factor
The subject matter is just insulting.",2
"wake me up when it's done","The royal family can rest easy. All the worries about a delicate fifth season were completely unfounded as viewers fall asleep after the second episode and stop after the fourth episode and watch something else. I was so looking forward to the new season, like so many others. But it's unbearably slow, boring, uninteresting, and unimportant. Big disappointment. Lady diana and prince charles are played very well. That has to be said. The similarity of facial expressions and gestures is spot on. It's just a shame that you're following other characters all the time that you don't know and aren't interested in.",10
"Brilliant.","I am Irish and don't like anything to do with the British Royal family or what they represent. However this is a brilliantly made series. Lavish sets, great period detailing, excellent yet subtle musical score.
Love the casting and the acting. Some facts we're questionable and skewed but appreciated for added dramatic appeal.",10
"Season 5 disappoints","I had been looking so forward to season 5 only to be disappointed.It was so boring compared to the previous seasons, Claire Foy played the best queen and did the middle aged queen.Unfortunately season 5 the cast all but Diana don't look like the real life royals. Charles was miscast the actor is good, however they could have used some prosthetics for the big ears and nose. He was far too handsome compared to the real Charles, Camilla looks like Camilla, Philip doesn't resemble the real one either.The actress that plays Diana tries a little too hard always with those doe eyes Diana was charming, sweet and charismatic.It was interesting about the Tzars and seeing Diana visiting her brother and the breaks failing, knowing her phone was hacked.. they tackled some of the taboo subjects including Philips affair. I didn't know he called the Queen Cabbage she always did look so old even when young.Hopefully season 6 is better as this was way too boring I lost interest in every episode.",10
"Disappointing","I have never written a review / add comments, but this time I feel I should.
Season 1 and 2 were brilliant, but at watching season 3, my wife and I got really bored at times. The acting of Olivia Colman was soo totally different, it 'killed' the grandeur Claire Foy brought in the first two seasons.
In fact, we more or less assumed this season would be the last one...
But just read that Claire will back in season 4 - hopefully she is well paid now...
I am sure Olivia Colman is a great actress, but in our opinion, not in this role.* It seems when rating season 3 (5/10) - I'll be rating all seasons as well.",10
"Best Princess Diana casting","Emma Corrin is the best Princess Diana casting, charming, lovely, energetic and elegant. She is the one who kept me wathcing.",10
"Phenomenal","Oh my, i just love this programme. Just finished season 3 and whilst yes i enjoyed the previous 2 seasons this one is by far the very best.
Olivia Coleman is an absolutely splendid Queen Elizabeth and i really cannot shout that loud enough. I have always loved & respected our Queen immensely and the chance to get to know her just a little bit better makes my heart happy.
Thank you Olivia, in my opinion this is your absolute best work to date. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.
I am gutted its finished, what am i going to watch for the next year!",8
"Season 3 takes getting used to","I have quite enjoyed the crown and came to love the actor's portraying the royal family. However, such a big change from season 1-2 to season 3. I kind of wish they would have aged the original actors than replacing them. The Queen and Princess Margaret's eye colors changed from blue to brown. I understand the need to change, but not sure if removing the first cast was the way to go.",9
"The crown","The series was a great acting performance in the series, especially from Claire Foy, and she deserved the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her embodiment of the life of the Queen when she was young, and Olivia Coleman for embodying the life of the Queen. While she was middle aged, Matt Smith for his portrayal of Prince Philip If Gillian Anderson doesn't win a Golden Globe for Best Actress, the award is unfair. The biggest negative about the series is its slowness and some characters like Princess Margaret. Although there is some distortion in history that did not spoil the series, I am very excited about the fifth season of The Crown",10
"Never in a Million Years","At first glance, I would have never thought in a million years that a biopic television series about a, then living, British queen would interest me. But man was I wrong! This is dramatic television of the highest order and a ""crowning"" achievement in cinematography and storytelling - small screen or big. The writing has its artist liberties, and its plot may not be completely factual, but nonetheless, it's a gripping story that, we as the viewers, can draw its relationship to events we've witnessed alongside the cast in their retelling of 20th century events. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who values production, story telling and career defining performances.",7
"Change of actors","Brilliant in every way with one exception. I wasn't happy when the actors changed. I wonder why the original actors couldn't just remain with makeup to show aging. I became quite fond of the first Queen, her sister Margaret, and Philip. Not used to the second set yet.",3
"Oh dear season 5","Gloomy, slow, unconvincing and as we know some things never happened. Imelda Staunton is quite grim as the Queen, it was a difficult decade, but one light-hearted scene of her playing with the corgis was not enough! And Dominic West was too good looking and smooth to be Prince Charles.All in all I was disappointed, but beautifully filmed as ever with fantastic locations and attention to details. The killing of the Romanov family in Russia in 1917 was especially moving and gripping alongside the visit later by the Queen to Russia, that made me want to read my history better. The relationship to the British press was well portrayed and I thought the young Prince William and his teas with the Queen were great scenes, in an otherwise gloomy tone. I will watch any new series though.",9
"Accurate but not accurate","Coming from someone who has met several members of the royal family, this is a bit of a strange one. I absolutely love it and can't get enough of it.In terms of accuracy nobody knows only the royal family and I'm sure they will be laughing at how false it is and holding there hands in there head at how over dramatic they are portrayed.The cinematography is absolutely stunning and the locations as well as the accuracy of the sets is sublime. Hats off to Netflix they've done well with it all, from the shots in the palaces and castles to small things like particular aircraft and liveries of the eras. It's the small things that make the difference.The soundtrack is probably one of the best bits about it all. Puts you in the mood and sets the tone through the different scenes. Martin Phipps well done.Yes it's a drama and it needed to be watchable in order to make it worth while. The cast was well selected and you develop hatred and love for the same person over the several seasons. Pip Torrens is a great example of this.I've enjoyed it all the way through from 1-4 so far and looking forward to 5.Don't dismiss the fact that the story is over exaggerated it has to be otherwise it's a documentary and people would have switched off after the 1st season.Keep up the good work and don't let it go stale.",9
"A crowning achievement","Love historical dramas, and it fascinated me just as much to see one centred around (as of now) our longest reigning monarch, a title that for a long time was given to Queen Victoria. There was so much talent involved that my interest was sparked further, despite admittedly not being the biggest fan of Netflix. 'The Crown' turned out to be a wonderful series, at its very best some of the best television seen in a while and in a completely different league to much of anything else Netflix has done (so much so that it had to be a check to see that it definitely came from Netflix). Season 1 was so well executed in every regard, while Season 2 boasted even richer material. Totally get the adoration, while sharing some viewers' misgivings about the inaccuracies and some biased and distorted characterisations (the Duke and Duchess of Windsor coming off worst). Vanessa Kirby for my tastes was a bit too annoying as Margaret as well. However, the great things far eclipse the not so good. When 'The Crown' was great, it was the very meaning of a crowning achievement. It couldn't have been any more classy and sumptuous visually. The photography and production and costume design are evocative and a sight to behold. The music for me wasn't too intrusive or low-key and was beautiful scoring on its own. The main theme is not easy to forget. Writing probes a lot of thought and intrigue, it is much more than soap-opera and doesn't feel too modern (not like 'Victoria'). Loved the intimacy and subtle tension of the storytelling in each episode, the deliberate pace in no way a hindrance, and the character chemistry scintillates. The characters are very compellingly written, with enough balance in characterisation to overshadow the instances of one-sidedness and most of them have more than one layer. Cannot find many qualms with the acting. Claire Foy is dignity and class personified and Matt Smith acts every bit as splendidly with lots of authority. One of the biggest standouts of the near-uniformly strong support (Kirby being the exception) is the powerhouse that is John Lithgow, so much so that one can look past misgivings of him not being quite right physically (being too tall for one by nearly a foot, Churchill was not a tall man). Overall, deserving of the acclaim it's garnered. Not quite perfect but really quite wonderful and something of an achievement. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9
"Margaret Thatcher","I can't take the phony accent. Margaret Thatcher never sounded this bad in real life. Every time she speaks it sounds like she is gasping for her last breath.",8
"Beautiful To Look At, Uneven Historically","The Crown is certainly a beautiful drama. There was no expense spared in replicating some iconic scenes. But from the first episode onward, there are some significant historic inaccuracies that detract from the production.The most grievous is in the way the writers frame the roles of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. For one thing, it's clearly documented that she fled England before his abdication. She did not sit by his side while he gave the abdication speech. She was in France, sobbing her eyes out.And, she only met Queen Mary once, at a ball, and only for a moment. However, she took steps to heal the rift, and the Queen famously added a PS to a letter saying, ""I send a kind message to your wife."" By the 1950s, there was barely any contact between the Palace and the Windsors. They were off in Paris or in New York, and there were no circumstances under which he would have been an adviser to the Queen. This is all fabricated.Also, one of the writers must have it in for the Queen Mother, because her portrayal is nothing like the friendly, fun loving woman that she was. She's almost unrecognizable.My advice to anyone watching is to consider this as ""inspired by"" the life of the Queen, but by no means take it as fact.",10
"Astoundingly good!","I never give 10 stars, but in this case there simply is no other way.
I cannot find a single thing that could detract my score in this series. The acting is on a mindblowingly high level from everyone involved. And because you can't have the royals speak their mind all the time, the actors must convey tons of ""dialogue"" with their expressions only! So with the enormous gallery of people here, it must have been a nightmare trying to find actors which not only fit the role, and were good enough, but also had to look alike too! But they have succeeded perfectly! I didn't realize there were this many top level actors in Britain!
The direction and sets also deserve praise!
I seldom call something perfect, but that word is really on the tip of my tounge here...",9
"Your Netflix subscription dollars at work!","Plot summary: A shy young woman, descended from a long line of hardworking German immigrants, doesn't feel quite ready to take over the family business.The first season, scripted by the brilliant Peter Morgan (""The Queen""), covers only the first few years of the young queen's reign, and this big canvas, like a painting by Breughel or Bosch (but with nicer furniture!), allows for a tight focus on some tiny but revealing details; I especially liked the episode in which ER II, who's only been taught French, deportment and the British constitution, uses her expert knowledge of the latter to outfox the palace HR department (it's complicated) and hires a tutor to teach her, among other things, how the H-bomb works.The cast is just about perfect, and Morgan's done an amazing job of bringing these remote, puppetlike figures (especially so for those of us who grew up during that era) to life in a convincing way. Over the course of ten episodes, we see Claire Foy's soft, expressive face transformed into an impassive mask of authority (perhaps the makeup artists deserve some credit here). Mike ""Dr. Who"" Smith is especially impressive as a slightly feral Prince Phillip, likewise Jared Harris as a menschy George VI, and John Lithgow (6'-4"") totally crushes it as a supersize Winston Churchill (5'-6"").It's all pretty great. Most of the drama consists of intense two-shot interactions in overdecorated rooms, but there's plenty of royal pageantry, plus excursions to Kenya and Australia (both played by South Africa, btw) and various primo huntin', shootin' and fishin' spots. On to season two! We're eager to see if Princess Margaret really had it off with Jagger during the 60s!Update: We're still on board with S5. The other royals are completely upstaged by the antics of future Charles III and Di, of course, so that competing subplots--Phillip's platonic friendship with MILFy Penny Knatchbull, for example--start to seem like filler, but otherwise it's all good.",8
"The Crown: Stylish, Classy and Original","Taking place in the 20th century, 1947 to be precise. King George VI is coughing up blood and is drawing his last breath. Mean while Queen Elizabeth is to be wed to Philip Mountbatten. When she is blindsided by George's demise. She's left in awe, as she has no education to lead her people. As her ascension was not predicted to happen in the near future. Realizing the predicament she is in. She struggles to keep her people in line while trying to comprehend the overwhelming responsibilities she must bare. With the weight of her country on her shoulders she must knuckle down and take a step forward to embrace her influence. Produced by Peter Morgan, who is know for penning the overzealous ""The Queen(2006)"". You can tell that no expense was spared, as the series has an estimated budget of one hundred million pounds, the show enraptures you with it's glorious visuals and stupendous costumes. The actors, are strong in there respective fields, especially Jared Harris who delivers the performance of his career as King George VI. On top of all this, Hans Zimmer and Rupert Gregson-Williams scored the soundtrack. Which should tell you the talent that is behind this epic series. Netflix has truly outdone themselves.",9
"It's a Drama, Not a Documentary","Season One (2016) Breathtakingly elegant in its design and entrancingly complex in its character, it draws you in with brilliantly crafted drama and holds you with intricately layered performances. There's an atmosphere of overwhelming intensity which perfectly emphasises the unpreparedness of Foy's Elizabeth as she enters her new role and, while detractors will list their heightened knowledge of historical inaccuracies with the appropriate level of pomposity, it never claims to be a Wikipedia article. If you want pure history, watch a documentary.Season Two (2017) Building upon the charming elegance of the first season, the follow-up thrusts the audience into a grim and uncertain atmosphere that perfectly captures post-Churchill England. The drama is heavier, the stakes are higher and the story unfolds in the deeply emotional performances at its heart, all of this intertwined in an air of regal splendour that's difficult not to love.Season Three (2019) There is truly something to be said for the illusion of pitch perfect casting and it works well to this season's advantage, making it feel like the eight or ninth year we've followed the same cast of characters rather than the third with a cast change. However, while the third season boasts the same emotional and dramatic tension we've come to expect, some of the deepest drama and most stirring moments of its run in fact, what's missing is the majestic flourish of earlier episodes; its absense lifting the veil of awe and resplendence and letting the season pass without the fanfare of earlier years.",8
"Season 5","Till the last season it was totally brilliant. The views, character's definitions all kind point of views and so on. However the last season it was just a tribute to charles. It was just unfair that all the way up diana was represented like desperate housewifes and on the other Side charles was brilliant and impecible politician. Despite that is not true and also unrespectful behavior to the memury of diana in people's heart. Charles influences! The producer very well. It was just a tremendous coincidence that is the exact time to be the king.My ratings are all about the previous seasons cause they had the Balance and justice in it.",7
"Season 5 is a BIG disappointment","The first 4 seasons were spectacular. I was enthralled and recommended the show to everyone I know. The backdrop, the locations, the costumes, the characters, the acting all superb. But this anxiously awaited season 5 is so dramatically different. There are ridiculous situations, poor story development, cheapened sets. It's almost hard to watch. All the characters are unhappy and angry. Queen Elizabeth can apparently do nothing right. Diana seems very shallow and vindictive. A full episode dedicated to the Fayed story was WAY too long and boring. We never did learn how the family got their money and we learned practically nothing about Dodi, we saw a story mostly about his father. Don't waste your time.",3
"Season 5 and Presumably Season 6 should go back in the can","Sumptuously elegant, well researched, well written and well-acted, The Crown is a cinematic delight until........ Season 5. I can forgive the cast change in Season 3 due to well written episodes and in particular the very fine Olivia Colman and Helena Bonham Carter. I cannot forgive the horrible characters which now portray QEII (senile, tepid, weak) Charles (no resemblance whatever), Phillip (not even close) and others. Writing is off. Plots not as interesting. The only aspect in Season 5 that rings true to all of the other seasons is the magnificent cinematography. This could have been so much better as it started so very strong with Claire Foy and Matt Smith. Sad.",8
"Compelling, until season three.","The Crown is a deep insight into a very public family's personal life. The entire production sets are as grand as one could imagine Buckingham Palace to be. I was quite taken by the casting of the characters, except for one, in season three. The character that disturbed me the most was that of Princess Marguerite. When we left season two, Princess Marguerite, who was featured heavily, was a picturesque beauty, played by Vanessa Kirby. Ms Kirby controlled the stage as she moved gracefully across camera catching the eye of every gentleman in the room.
Come season three Ms Kirby is replaced by a short, angry character, making one turn away in revulsion. Not only is she 5 inches shorter, but even the slightest feminine flare is non-existent. Ms Kirby's replacement, actress Helen Bonham Carter is a fine award winning actress and is amazing for the characters she takes on, but by no fault of her own, is miscast. Season two went out of its way to promote Marguerite's sensuality. It gave The Crown some much needed ""Spice."" It goes to show you how important casting the right actor can take a show to the next level, and then again, the wrong actor knock it down a notch...or two.",8
"Season 3","Well seen some negative on Olivia Coleman and I disagree big time, excellent acting from her also the guy who plays Prince Charles is very exceptional.everytime I watch I feel as if it's a history lesson also into a really good TV show with a stellar cast",10
"A must-watch","The Crown is a Netflix original series that has been captivating audiences since its debut in 2016. The show chronicles the life of Queen Elizabeth II, from her early days as a newlywed to her current reign as the longest-serving monarch in British history. The series is a masterful blend of drama, history, and politics, and it has been praised for its stunning cinematography, intricate costume design, and exceptional performances by its cast.The show's fifth season, which premiered in November 2022, is no exception. The season features an all-star cast, including Imelda Staunton as Queen Elizabeth II, Dominic West as Prince Charles, and Elizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana. The season focuses on the tumultuous 1990s, a decade that saw the royal family face unprecedented scrutiny and scandal.Despite the controversies surrounding the show's portrayal of the royal family, The Crown continues to be a critical and commercial success. The show's writing is sharp and insightful, and it offers a nuanced look at the complex relationships and power dynamics within the royal family. The show's attention to detail is also impressive, with meticulous recreations of historical events and locations.Overall, The Crown is a must-watch for anyone interested in history, politics, or drama. The show's exceptional production values, outstanding performances, and compelling storytelling make it one of the best shows on television today. I highly recommend it!",10
"Enjoyable","Most of Queen Elizabeth's long reign. Every two seasons all the actors change as the characters age, and it's often a bit of an adjustment, but everyone's quite good (even a horribly, purposely miscast Dominic West as Charles).The show has a good sense of place and drama (much apparently heavily fictionalized) and the series has a perpetual interest in the sacrifices of duty, which may or may not be worthwhile.The final Elizabeth is a bit of a pill, but that tracks with the rest of the show. Still, she's the least likable of the starchy lot.This is classic English period comfort food, full of humor and quiet English tragedy, and well worth watching.",8
"Season 4 wow!","I have to admit sadly, that I was incredibly disappointed in season three of The Crown. I thought it moved incredibly slowly to the point it was hard to continue watching at times. But I just finished all of season four and all I can say is wow! Another word I would use, is uncomfortable. The portrayal of the relationships throughout the season was so beautifully acted that it was actually uncomfortable to watch. But I could watch season four over and over again.",9
"Season 3 VS Seasons 1 + 2","Claire Foy, Matt Smith
King George, the Churchill's,
Tony Armstrong Jones.....
(The original actors)
All acted superbly, just brilliantly, as I'm sure everyone agrees......
I watched these 2 seasons 4 times and loved every minute!!I know many people enjoyed Season 3 just as much.....
And I'm no one to criticize, but I simply hated season 3.... the actors, the script, the dynamics.....
I was ever so disappointed.... I think to me the Crown will only ever be Season 1 & 2......which I truly truly loved and enjoyed!",10
"Not bad","If Churchill dies in 1965, that would make the Queen 38, so why dies she look 50?",7
"Season 3 is a huge disappointment","Claire Foy was absolutely on point as the Queen in Season 1 and 2. Why mess with that? They totally could have altered her appearance to age her. I love HBC but I don't see her as Princess Margaret.... This season is so dreadfully slow and lacking in any momentum.What a disappointment",5
"«History was not made by those who did nothing»","While the Queen is celebrating her Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years as Monarch, the time to watch «The Crown» has come.The series covers the period from Elizabeth's marriage in 1947 to nowadays, telling the story of the British Royal family, political intrigue and personal events that have shaped Her Majesty's reign.There are numerous twists and turns, which can surprise you even if you're good at history. Moreover, the acting is truly amazing: it's easy to forget that John Lithgow isn't really the Winston Churchill. On top of that, the tuneful soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer is a real masterpiece.I would highly recommend «The Crown», especially if you're keen on historical dramas. A must-see for those who love British culture and admire the Queen.",9
"Simply Brilliant","Easily one of the best series ever produced. The quality of the work from the first episode to the finale is nothing short of spectacular. The amount of detail that went into each episode is just amazing. While I will always have a special place in my heart for the characters from the first two seasons, the casting throughout was top notch. If you have not seen this before, I cannot recommend it enough. I created an IMDB account just to review this show. The Crown has everything, production value, a terrific score, quality acting, and a storyline that will keep you hooked. If you're on the fence, just watch it!",10
"if only i could rate seasons separately","I have to give The Crown at least 8, because previous seasons. However....what happened to season 5?I miss the speed. I miss the big events I could google while watching. Previous season covered 8 to 13 years and this one seems to cover only five years? I am 6 episodes in and it seems like they're only focusing on the love triangle and the relationships. And it gets, my apologies, kinda boring.Also if they cover only five years in this season, they will have ""crowded"" sixth season. Diana, Margaret, Harry's scandals, Mexit, Duke and finally Queen.Or..! Will there be 7th season? Does anybody know?",8
"First class","Thoroughly enjoyed the third season of the crown no expense seems to have been spared with surroundings and costumes acting fantastic make up incredible actors really do look like the Royals",10
"Modern language,,,,,,,,,,,,,","As magnificent as this series is, it's highly unlikely that anyone in the early 50's used the expressions, ' I just wanted to give you the heads up' or 'ticked all the boxes'.. I suppose I could stand corrected and I guess the writers did thorough research but what do I know ?,",9
"Brilliant, ignore the negative reviews","I don't comment on much but there are some people with their nose bent out of shape and just like a moan. The handling of the Di and Dodi death is done amazingly well and some people seem very annoyed about something they have absolutely no idea about what went on!! There is no script or dialog from what went on, this is specialtion and guess work otherwise known as DRAMATISATION!!If you haven't started season 1 yet then you are in for a treat. All the main characters are cast so well and even in season 6 you will not be disappointed.Ignore the neysayers and buckle up for an engrossing trip!",10
"Season 1+2 and season 3","I watched seasons 1 + 2 four times! And could watch them again and again. They were fantastic.... and Claire Foy And Matt Smith were superb, charismatic....(can go on and on) and acted their parts brilliantly.
I was ever so disappointed that the actors were changed. And much as Olivia Coleman is a great actress...I was so disappointed by the season. Queen Elizabeth and prince Philip weren't half as charismatic. I couldn't warm up to them. And ended up watching season 3 only once, with no intention of ever watching it again! Such a huge huge Pity!",9
"Review for Season 5","Wow! I loved this Netflix program and was so looking forward to season five, but I must say that I am really disappointed in the acting, and the portrayal of the characters after having been used to the former Queen Elizabeth, the second, and even Prince, Philip Diana, etc. The new cast is just not making the mark I'm not even sure that I'm going to continue to watch. I am on episode three of season five and it's falling far below my expectations of this wonderful series up to this point hanging for a little bit but I do hope it gets better. This is really a disappointment for anyone that was invested in the first four seasons .",10
"British historical drama at its most superb","I dipped into the first episode of this and found myself losing an entire weekend binge-watching the whole series.A fantastic depiction of a young woman catapulted into one of the highest positions on earth and struggling to marry the detachment her position demands with her personal self.Quite apart from the superb acting, magnificent settings, costumes and demeanour, this works merely as a deeply personal story of Elizabeth, Philip, Margaret, Peter, Churchill and many more...all depicted with honesty and precision. The scene where Churchill is forced to come to terms with his great age and frailty had me in tears. I also ached for Margaret and Peter.It will be easy to dismiss this from a Republican standpoint, but for anyone else, it is mesmerizing.",7
"Fantastic for the first 2 seasons, then they screwed up...","Just started watching this and thought it was great.. Well it was, it was fantastic for the first 2 seasons then they screwed up casting by choosing a rather too old figure for a 39 yo Queen.. IMO.. She looks like 49 or even 59 yo.. I started to loose the appetite to continue after 4 episodes of seasons 3..",5
"Season 3 only","I loved seasons 1&2, however to see that they changed all the main characters over in Season 3 was mind boggling to me. I tried watching and just could not enjoy it. I wish they had just kept the original cast and "" aged"" them with makeup. No disrespect to the actors taking the place of the original cast, but I feel like I'm watching a completely different show. I will not continue to watch anymore.",9
"Not as good as the first two seasons","I loved the first two seasons. They were amazing.
Season three was just so different. It gave such a bad impression of all the family and made them all out to be lonely people all infighting and all very sad.
I fully appreciate that families have their difficulties but it was just not nice at all.
I am not a loyalist but a fan of this show and I finished season three very disappointed that they were all made out to be this way.
The actors were all great though and I strangely like Prince Phillip the most until his last speech to Dianna.
Worth a watch hence my 5 stars but the body of season three didn't work for me.",8
"John Lithgow as Winston Churchill","I am watching season 1 episode 9 where we see John Lithgow as Winston Churchill getting his portrait painted. And he is talking about his very young daughter that died at a young age. Mr. Lithgow portrayed the feelings of this loss as if he had experienced such a tragic death in his own life. Maybe he has but I think that is unlikely. Very good acting. Good show as well. All the actors do the show proud.",10
"From Glory to Soap","My rating of this show has dropped from a 10 after 3 seasons, to an 8 now.
The first two seasons portrayed historical world events and the connection of the Royal Family to what were important times for Britain. The third season was more intimate but was in some ways more intriguing in spite of, or perhaps because of this. Prince Charles's investiture in Wales for example, or Mountbatten's speech to the Burma society.But by the 4th season we have descended to the level of soap opera. I'm not necessarily a fan of the Royal Family but here they were portrayed in the worst imaginable light. And I found myself thinking, this event is made up, that dialogue is a fiction. etc. Which I didn't in the first 3 seasons. There's no way that Thatcher had a dislike for the Queen in the way portrayed here - have a look at the interview on YouTube of Thatcher praising her.I did think the production quality was very high and I loved the settings. The acting was very good in parts. And I loved seeing the Concorde, Land Rovers and Westland? Helicopter.",8
"A brutal affair","The production is still very sumptuous and visually appealing. However. As the episodes became nearer to the present day, the more I cringed. Watching a drama of people, some, very much alive seemed very intrusive. The first episode of season 4 seemed to justify the IRA and their brutality, towards the Royal family and England. A more brutal depiction than previous seasons",8
"Well-told stories - but they are stories","I've now watched the three available seasons of The Crown and felt the need to comment on the cast changes from the first two seasons to season three with one-on-one comparisons.Claire Foy vs. Olivia Coleman as Queen Elizabeth. This is a huge win for Foy's nervous smile over Coleman's stone face. Foy has at least some warmth and grace in her manner. Coleman is like a statue. I can read between the lines to see what Foy's Queen is actually thinking. Nothing is coming in from Coleman's cranium. The lights are out. Coleman's mouth seems to have a natural frown to it, (she has my sympathy- so does mine and people often complain that I don't smile enough). It makes her seem cold and uncomfortable. Foy has some nervousness but an inner strength that comes through.Matt Smith vs. Tobias Menzies as Prince Phillip. I only know Prince Phillip from interviews and documentaries but he seems a strong, distinguished man of great presence. That comes though much more in Menzies' performance than in Smith's. Smith has a prominent brow and always seems to be staring at the camera from under it. It gives the impression of somebody who is always up to something. Philip in his younger days may have been a bit of a bounder. So maybe that's appropriate but Menzies is more my image of Phillip, although I'm not sure where his accent came from.Vanessa Kirby vs. Helena Bonham-Cater as Princess Margaret. Kirby, a statuesque beauty, certainly makes an impression. If they ever do a reboot of the 60's British TV Series the Avengers, Kirby would make an excellent Mrs. Peel with her slinky sexiness. Unfortunately, Margaret was more the stature of Bonham-Carter, whose lower-key bemusement seems to hit the mark. But she would have had a hard =-time playing the young, delicate-looking beauty Margaret was in the 50's. I certainly hope to see a lot more the charismatic Kirby but HBC wins this one.Victoria Hamilton and Marion Bailey as Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Neither made much of an impression or looked much like her. The episodes didn't seem to focus on her, even though she seems to have had a hard time seeing the power behind the throne shift away from her, (she didn't even want to leave Buckingham Palace). An under-developed character played in an under-whelming manner by both.Alex Jennings and Derek Jacobi as the Duke of Windsor. Jennings was a strange Prince Charles in Peter Morgan's ""The Queen"", trying to manipulate events to his advantage. He's far, far better as ""David"", a role he seems born to play. He looks the part and plays the man as the chess-player he clearly was, totally dedicated to his own desires. I'm sure he could have played the Duke as an old man without difficultly. Instead we get the round-faced Jacobi, unrecognizable as the same man.Lia Williams and Geraldine Chaplin as the Duchess of Windsor. Both were good. I saw no need to re-cast the role. As with Jennings, Williams would have been fine as the older Duchess.Greg Wise and Charles Dance as Lord Mountbatten. I thought both hit the mark. Wise was smoother, Dance more imposing, which seemed a little more appropriate.Mathew Goode and Ben Daniels as Anthony Armstrong-Jones. Goode played him as a reserved, rather arrogant cultural snob who for unknown reasons, married into the royal family and must have immediately regretted it. Daniels is a much more charming and charismatic performer who seems to dominate every scene he is in just by his presence. He seems much more like the type of person who could get people to pose for him and worm his way into the royal family. And I'd just rather see him act than the other guy.",9
"Overall","Now that season six is here and I've been re-watching the entire series, so it's safe to say it's a favorite. Here's why I think the writers accomplished something truly wonderful, by season Six. It's so easy to blame and find fault among the various characters, especially over Diana. But by S6 Ep4. The Aftermath, I was struck by how even though there was more than enough blame to be passed around. It became apparent that life isn't as black and white as we want it to be when trying to cope with tragedy.None of us is perfect Few of us know how to love perfectly or even to be loved. This has become a well rounded look at the British Monarchy and all the perspectives surrounding it.",10
"Fantastic drama","To be honest, I never cared much about the UK or the Queen but after watching the first two seasons I now have great respect for Her Majesty and what she endured.
PS: I will not watch the third season as I most certainly be disappointed.",10
"Marvelous... until season 6","I think that this series was very well done and played by the actors. Some issues (dialogues, personal relationships) had, of course, to be invented, but most of them are consistent and have a touch of authenticity. The problem came, from my point of view, within season 6. Some episodes are more suitable for a Venezuelan soap opera than for an fictional but probably intended portrait of the crown. First seasons rely on political issues, international relationships or even the struggles with prime ministers (Margaret Tatcher or Wiston Churchil were magnificent). Although of course important, focusing for so long on Diana relationship with Dodi or the courtship of the nowadays Prince and Princess of Wales and not paying enough attention to some problems for the Crown or some other political occurrences made the season six less palatable that the previous 5 seasons.",8
"Exemplary","I have no regard for the British monarchy. I find them to be entitled, self-centered, and useless. However, The Crown series is outstanding. The storylines, the writing, the acting, the sets, cinematography - every facet of the production is impeccable. I have watched each season twice.",10
"First two seasons are great, then the new cast tears it down","The actress playing the queen for the first two seasons is just tremendous. She knows how to tell a story in expressions without talking. Same goes for multiple people who were cast for the first two season, all great casts. All of the sudden the cast is changed and the clear British talks and expressions turn into mumbles and expressionless/forced faces. Such a shame. Just make the old cast look old and all wouldve been amazing as it were.",6
"Where's the real Diana?","I'm just wondering why Diana is seen as hiding in her home when she travelled everywhere for the different causes she was involved in? Why she is not shown touching and interacting with aids patients and walking by mine fields? How about housing for the poor? Those with leprosy? Why does it seem Charles gets more of a free pass ? Maybe because of the political climate? Shame on you for making her a selfish, narcissistic royal who hid away. She was completely loved and the most popular royal. This season of the Crown just seems like pandering to the establishment, and unfortunately, this is who the younger generation will think she is. The very person that tried to connect with her people, and did a dang good job.",4
"Brilliant Series but Catastrophic Mistake Changing Cast","I love the series but I am completely baffled as to why they changed the cast for Series 3. One review mentioned that it was 15 years later but I went back into the last episode of Series 2 and it started in April 1962; Series 3 starts just 2 years later in 1964, although it is true that the characters looked about 15 years older!! As much as I love Olivia Coleman & Helena Bonham Carter, both actresses were vastly different to Claire Foy & Vanessa Kirby's renditions of Queen Elizabeth & Princess Margaret respectively. Additionally, Prince Phillip had a complete personality and voice change in just 2 years... I actually thought that they had jumped forward to an older Prince Charles before I realised that it was Prince Phillip. Also, the new Queen Mother, played by Marion Bailey was unrecognisable both look and character wise from the previous Victoria Hamilton's performance. This lack of continuity is just awful and sooo let's the Series & the viewers down. All the actors performances have been superb but Netflix should have made their choice of cast and stuck to it, after all in this day and age they can achieve miracles with stage makeup. Unfortunately I'm now on Series 3 Episode 8 and the cast changes are still annoying me enough to reduce my rating from what would have been 10 out of 10 to just 8 out of 10.",8
"Quality decreased in season 3","I really liked seasons 1 & 2, but the third season was much less enjoyable. The acting of the new crew did mot reach up to the performance of the first one. Also, the caracters often remained quite 'flat' and really hard to grasp.",9
"Charles is not handsome or charismatic","Dear writers, blink twice if you've been forced by the royal family for season 5.The purpose of this season is so much different from other seasons. Obviously there are some missing points about Diana's story. I live in a country which is far away from England and i remember that my mother cried when Diana died. Why in all around the world people loved her so much? If she was a women like in season 5 there is no point to love her. Because all she's doing is, sitting at home, crying by herself, making plans to destroy royal family and desperately hoping someone to love her. If she was a women like this, how we can explain, even in the furthest countries everybody loved her so much? Do not make fun of our mind.",9
"Season 4: Fantastic and Darker than even the War Years, Diana and Thatcher new editions spectacular.","Lets face it The Crown is not for everyone but anyone who loved the first three seasons will find this season worth the wait. Oliver Coleman and most noticeably Tobias Menzies of GOT fame bring their special abilities to the major roles as before. The addition of the Diana and Thatcher add so much to the story line and their contributions are outstanding especially Anderson, The Series is a slice of History that continues to give us the viewers insights into the dark side of the Royal Family and all those who intertwined with them. One can only grow to hate Prince Chares more and see the wanting lustful side of Princess. Season Four retains its breathtaking style and is not to be missed. I found one episode not up to standards and had a problem with the lack of accomplishments that Thatcher brought to England not covered. Rich.",10
"A Masterpiece","Just finished watching Season 4. What a masterpiece.
The cast, the acting, the script, the costumes, the settings... all unbelievable.
It truly gives us an eye to what the royal family truly was.I particularly loved Olivia Coleman and Emma Corin, 'the young Diana'.
It is shocking how realistic their acting is-
and sadly, how historically accurate. Esp. Diana's wedding to Prince Charles.
Well done Netflix, this will be a reference point for future generations to come..Looking forward to Seasons 5 and 6!",10
"Essential watch","This show triumphs in the character development and powerful performances depicted by its supremely talented ensemble of actors and writers, and does an exceptional job in the use of visuals and soundtrack for storytelling.On a side note, I do suggest not taking the depictions of the actors and storytellers too seriously, as this is meant to be a work of art/drama and not a historically accurate documentary. I'd say viewers should be smart about how they interpret the story and the actual people it is based on. This is simply a version of reality. Most of the show borrows from real life events and conversations, but juxtaposes them differenty to fit the narrative.Overall, I would call this an essential viewing for almost everyone, as it is masterfully directed and spectacularly presented with compelling storylines that leave no room for boredom. Happy binge-watching!",9
"History blended with scandals.","Undeniably, unequivocally, extraordinary show.
A magnificent piece of work and art.
I loved the historical bits here and there .
It's granduer is realistic . The portrayal of characters is wonderfully underdone.
The Crown evokes a great deal of emotion through its well developed story and it's true-to-life characters.
Absolutely LOVE the series.",8
"Season 1-2: Absolute Perfectness, Season 3-4: So So, Season 5-6: Mediocre","I just completed all 6 seasons of the Crown. I still miss the superb and detailed script and acting of Seasons 1 & 2.However by Season 3 the script and the casting are both getting worse. Especially Olivia Colman's interpretation as the queen was a lady, who is too rigid, unhappy and negative. I expected to see much more versatile script and acting. There are some very good episodes but overall these two seasons are mediocre at best.By Season 5-6, all things focus on Princess Diana. I understand she is very popular and made a huge impact on many people but focusing on her entirely is a bit too much. There are many movies and series solely on her. We focused on her all 4 episodes of Season 6. In reality only first two episodes should be enough. We saw nothing new after the death of Princess Diana. Even the episode on the last year of Princess Margaret was sloppy. It seems that we all know wrong and the Queen only had one son, the others are never existed.We do not expect this show to be realistic like a documentary, we get that but overall because this is The Crown and we all saw what this show can do in the first two seasons. So it is understandable that we expected more.Maybe the show should just end with the death of Princess Diana.After 1997, the show tells us nothing. It seems that no economic crisis, wars, problems occur after this date.The only good thing about these two seasons are the casting especially Princess Diana and Princess Margaret.I am sorry this superb show ended with this sloppy season.",10
"I tip my hat to this author, this is brillant.","It goes to show that the author and creator of this series, Peter Morgan, has spent ample time with and learning about the Royals. And while it is of course not a documentary, the fictional characters he creates and one of the sharpest dialogues ever created in a television series, proves the point that this series, alongside with their amazing actors and actresses, in a high-quality production is one of the finest examples of tv series in existence. I am not a fan of Netflix, but I do love this series and I am in awe about this author and his writing style.It is gripping, it is emotional, it serves an emotional truth. And while some may complain about ""a ghost"", anyone who has lost anyone, knows that the person who is gone still lingers on in one's thoughts and in one's mind.Make no mistake, this is a series to stand the test of time. This is an author, of whom I hope, he will finish this series one day until the death of Queen Elizabeth II and potentially keep going.I cannot stress, how much I love this series and this screenwriter and this creator. My God, what an exemplary work of art!",7
"Season 3 Ep. 6 still not used to Colman","I almost didn't watch S. 3 at all when I heard Foy was out and Colman was in. Frankly, it's a different show. Colman is completely miscast. In a major way, it's her appearance but it's also her acting. You get the feeling there's a soulfulness she's fighting down deep, but with Foy you didn't have that and it was just more Right for a queen. I can't explain it she's just not good in this role. Foy had that royal stoicness was about her, Colman is too clunky. The overwrought Ep. 3, which could have been so powerful if not for Colman's performance. The beginning was excellent then the Queen appears and it's ruined. The ending of that episode was just plain bad- predictable and fake.The writing seems to have suffered some too.I adore Helena Bonham Carter but again her appearance also is so distracting. She's a completely different character. The previous Margaret was So Much Better and I keep comparing her to the old one as I watch. It honestly makes it difficult to concentrate on what's going on!All I can say is, yes, I'll see it to the end despite my extreme disappointment with the change of actresses.It's not as noticeable with Prince Phillip, but agewise all 3 previous actors could have been made up to age. It's 15 years later but this Queen and Margaret look 30+ years older! Colman looks nothing like Queen E 2 and in addition both Bonham Carter and Colman have deep-set dark brown eyes it's just not surmountable even if the acting was 1000 percent and it's just not.
Just so terribly miscast. A shame.
Every episode I watch I'm thinking: if only....",9
"Season 5: Going downhill fast","The first 4 seasons of the Crown were absolutely brilliant, with just a few bad casting decisions to detract from an otherwise perfect score: Churchill should have been played by John Sessions or Toby Jones instead of John Lithgow (who did a fine job but looked out of place), and Mrs Thatcher should not have been so grossly overplayed by Gillian Anderson - Caroline Langrishe would have been the perfect choice. The rest was pure bliss - which I say being very much against the concept of monarchy.But by season 5, everything falls apart. Sloppy writing, bad direction, bad editing and phoned in performances from miscast actors.Imelda Staunton is usually highly competent, but she does not bring the queen to life at all. Elizabeth Debicki tries way to hard (and is way too tall) to be Diana, Dominic West does not even try to be Charles. Charles Dance should have played prince Philip, and Julia McKenzie the queen mum. Helena B-C and the magnificent Oliva Colman (she didn't play the queen, she WAS the queen) should have stayed on as princess Margaret and the queen respectively.Also, the people responsible for hair and wigs need to do a much better job for the final season.In conclusion: First four series, a solid nine. The soapy series 5 barely makes five stars.",10
"Season three","Struggling to bond with Olivia, she just cant keep the pathos out of those big brown eyes and Elizabeth has none.NONE...!!! she is very good all the same.Am liking the Season a lot. The cast are all good, Alice Ann Margaret and esp love Charles and Wilson .. Ive just finished ep 7 and looking fwd to the rest, and to Season 4. Fantastic achievement.",10
"Olivia is amazing ..","I loved Clair very much in this role.. and was afraid the new replacement wouldn't be the same quality.. totally I was wrong .. Olivia Coleman is such a great actress and added more depth to the character..",8
"A Splediferous and Poignant Undertaking","The superlatives have been well noted on this MASTERPIECE produced for Netflix. The reign of Elizabeth II has been covered and recovered in almost every aspect however, there are still many situations and incidents the general public knows too little of. Perhaps it will always be so for us.This seemed like a labor of love and was a huge undertaking. The producers, the many directors, the entire production crew deserve kudos for the amount of research that had to be accomplished, the sets, cinematography. I don't think there is much more I can say that would add to what has been written. After all, the creation of this by Peter Morgan had to fill his days and nights with endless thought and revision along with additions.What stands out for me are the performances of so many we had never known before and quite a few we have seen in other films or UK productions but Claire Foy, as the young Princess and Queen along with John Lithgow as Winston Churchill stand out in my mind as the very top of the top drawer. It was truly the performances of these two superb actors that kept me watching and had me fully invested. The cast is incredibly lengthy and each one...down to the Cockney newspaper hawker gave their very best every time! Amazing too, were the resemblances to the actual people. The one exception was Helena Bonham Carter as The Princess Margaret. The younger Margaret was believable since there was a resemblance but HBC didn't resemble her at all. The one thing that made it so acceptable is that Helena Bonham Carter was a stand-out and has the acting chops to accurately portray a woman we Americans knew as the Princess who could not marry the love of her life, Peter Townsend. Elizabeth and Margaret were two different sides of that proverbial coin and exact opposites in so many ways.From 2016 - 2023 the series aired on Netflix and I can only recommend that you do not miss a moment of this entire production. Each episode is worthwhile but there are a few that are particularly worthy of mention. Chief among them is the episode involving the tragedy of Aberfan, Wales in 1966. It is heart wrenching, disturbing and was avoidable. We also see the logic behind ""Britannia"" the Royal Yacht that was christened by Queen Elizabeth in 1953 and became the mode of transport to all the commonwealth countries throughout the world! Also of interest are episodes which deal with countries of the Commonwealth that were lost and peeled away as each sought to form its own government. Strangely absent is the saga involving India. The Lord Albert Victor Nicholas Louis Francis Mountbatten, Elizabeth's Uncle 'Dickie, is continually referred to, by Winston Churchill, as ""the man who gave away India.""I'd been fortunate enough to see Elizabeth being crowned June of 1953. Television was still in its infancy, I was only 5 years of age and yet, I insisted on watching it. Of course, it was years before color television was available but the splendor, history and majesty were there for all to witness. The Coronation was something grand. The British people have stood by it for many years and most especially under the reign of Elizabeth. For many, she was the only queen they ever knew. I don't think you'll regret doing so for it will hold your interest each time you view it.",10
"Good, but very slow","A short list of the positive and negative qualities:+
Beautiful filming and excellent sound mixing.
The actors did a very good job portraying the members of the royal family (especially Claire Foy). They clearly did their research on the character.
Well written: strong dialogues.
Sometimes really touching.-
The cast change is hard to get used to (even though the second cast is as good as the first one).
Very very very slow.",8
"Excellent series, high standards","The whole series is extremely well made, there are no gaps in the storytelling in terms of quality, the music undertones correctly the situations. Colman and Menzies pick up the slack and ease us in the third chapter seamlessly. My only objection is the 4th episode of the 3rd season, it is a laughable depiction of the country, the situation at the time and even the people. The nuns are wrong, the churches are wrong, the accents are Cypriot! which is simply funny to a Greek, and while you can excuse the accent of the princess as she is a foreigner, the rest are borderline hilarious. 4 stars for this episode, 8 for the rest.",8
"the best after narcos'","Netflix's best biographical elite drama show after the Narcos'. So appreciated to learn that the show will get longer and be finished at its top level. Netflix must hold on and continue producing shows like this",10
"Great series, with a surprising (to me) reservation","Great fun, super acting, wonderful writing. I'm surprised to find that the PHYSICAL casting makes a difference to me, though - which is actually a testament to how realistic a job they've all done in so many other ways. I'm thinking of Emma Corrin (as Diana) and Josh O'Connor (as Charles), each of whom captures the essential personality; but she's just too petite (look at photos, Diana's shoulders were much broader and her facial features fuller) and he's too baby-faced (Charles looked like he was 50 when he was 30). In the midst of so many other believable portrayals, those are somewhat jarring. But that's really my only slight beef - they're both excellent actors, and everything else is so good it hardly distracts.",8
"Pretty good.","Great acting.Honestly u learn so much about the royal family.",8
"S3. Good but... what were they thinking","Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth, Helena Bonham Carter as Margaret? Such bad casting. Olivia has a rough face and looks angry most of the time throughout the episodes. Helena Bonham Carter, although a great actress, doesn't do Margaret any justice at all (she doesn't look anything like Margaret)
The first two series were much better because of the actors. Series 3 has great topics but the actors were cast wrongly except the nun princess Alice and prince Charles. They were excellent.",7
"Would have been a 10","Why, why, why did they think they needed to change the whole staff?! I was very invested in the actors from 1&2 and then everyone is gone! And these new ones don't even resemble the others at all!! Whoever thought this was a good idea is crazy! Lost another viewer!",5
"All hail Peter Morgan","I approached the last season of The Queen/Crown with some trepidation. What if the critics were right? What if this great soap opera just turned out to be another hollow crown?No need to worry. Morgan plants so many Trojan Horses in the piece, it should be called Iliad 2.The royals become operatic in a way that they could never have achieved for themselves,.Talk about a ""silk purse""! Bet Morgan just bought em 25 more years....Anyhoo.Fast forward through the harry/william brouhaha. It's just more of the same. But with a more killer soundtrack.Here's a short listQueenMolokoBlurRadiohead...Julio Iglesias...Chumbawamba.",10
"Very addictive","Great acting and a very addictive series. Looking forward to S3 and a further look into the Royal family",8
"Thank you Netflix","Just finished watching the final episode of this series, so beautifully done, I have tears in my eyes as I did at the time our
Queen's funeral, listening to the Pipers Lament.Our wonderful, beautiful Queen, I still can't believe she's no longer with us. Thank you Netflix for this amazing series covering her reign, thank you for being respectful to her memory.Imelda Staunton was wonderful playing the aging monarch as we're all the actresses playing her younger self. Jonathan Price captured the personality of Prince Phillip to a T and the two princes played their roles admirably. Altogether a brilliant series that I look forward to watching all over again.",10
"Superb","Astounding acting. Casting have knocked it out of the park here. Cannot get enough of this drama. Excellent and addictive",10
"WOW","I Was never a follower of the ""monarchy"" until the Diana and Charles courtship, BUT watching this (fictional and dramatisation) of the, OUR queen ! SHE Stood by what she vowed! She really did ""serve"" her whole life as queen, (I did often wonder WHY she didn't ""take"" retirement, You really do need to watch it not as a royalist and not as an anti royalist, but to just watch it as it tv show. Informative, interesting (in most parts). Brilliant. Apparently I need to six hundred characters to be able to leave a review!! But I have enjoyed (at the age of 53, finding out about the ROYAL family and how strict it was for them! And cat wait for final season.",10
"Series goes from great to blah","Seasons 1 and 2 rank as among best TV serials ever produced. Season 3 is bearable despite change in cast; and it does retain some significant historic events. So far Season 4 is looking more like American TV. Margaret Thatcher is poorly depicted; she looks to be about 80 years old and very malnourished (perhaps Diana is not the only one suffering from an eating disorder).",8
"Brilliant series, exceptional performances! 10/10","I have no proper words to describe how great this series is. At first, as a young person, I found the politics and political life of the king and then the Queen Elizabeth a bit dull, but as the show advanced, I found those scenes a lot more interesting as I began to understand the history and the story of the characters better.Claire Foy, Matt Smith, Olivia Colman, Vanessa Kirby, Emma Corrin and Elizabeth Debicki played WONDERFULLY their parts as Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Phillip, Princess Margaret and Princess Diana , until where I've watched the series (season 5) was absolutely brilliant!The depiction of every detail of the royals life and relationships made this series one of the best streaming on Netflix. The producers were historically very accurate for a Netflix show, therefore the series was making me binge watch season 4 and 5 almost without catching a breath.Thanks to The Crown I understood very much better the life at the court and the ""crown's"" family members, especially those who were not born to the royal family - meaning prince Phillip and Princess Diana who were the main victims of the System and the monarchy. Poor collateral victims of the Crown's power, also to the extent of their ability to survive ...",10
"Disappointed in the changes","Love ""The Crown,"" at least Seasons 1 and 2. The characters were well-chosen for the people they portray. I was so much looking forward to Season 3. Alas, the characters in Season 3 are in no way representative of who they are supposed to be. (And a Lyndon Johnson without a Southern accent is pretty ridiculous.) The characters could have been aged rather than replaced. I have lost interest. Such a shame. This is a perfect example of 'If it ain't broke, . . .",8
"Great TV but ""sanitized""","The cast is great, the storylines are interesting (for the most part) and it feels like your taking part in history. Cinematografy is also spot on. Most of the time feels like watching a very long movie not a tv show.However it paints a very romanticized picture of the royal family and government in Britain. There is always a feel-good factor, a cozy feeling that all those involved in the events are good at heart and only want the best for queen and country. There is a detachement to issues like decolonization, legacy of empire and unrest/social issues during her reign in Britain. The whole idea of monarchy is a bit glamorized.But even for a.staunch anti-monarchist like myself, it's a great show..",7
"Season 3 is boring","I'm really not enjoying this season. The writing is nothing special and it makes the Queen seem like a dingbat! Don't enjoy the new cast! I feel the writers should have watched the many docs that have been shown throughout the years about the Queen!",4
"Its a Drama!!!","I get that most people don't like season 5 because it had the flaws. I won't go into detail here bc you can find many more. Some hate the non-historical aspects of the show. It's a historical drama, not a historical documentary, guys! Don't judge a book by its cover. The Crown is a mixture of historical fact with dramatic, spicy fiction. And for the most part, the acting is great, the cast is fine, and I don't hate season five as much as most others do. Some people do like it, and I'm ok with it. Everyone has their own opinion, so don't try to tell others that they're wrong because they aren't!",10
"Why in the...did I wait for so long...","People have been on about this show for years, and I've been ""neeh- monarchy is not my thing"". A few days ago I was waiting for my favourite shows to air the weekly episodes and decided to check this one out whilst waiting . I'd already watched a couple of episodes and apparently abandoned it there after. What a mistake! Since then I've binged - and still only in season 1 - I am hooked! I do realise, that I've always fancied shows about historical figures or events, so I should have realised it would catch on. When history can be connected to one's own experiences even more so (old enough to have experienced a somewhat younger Elisabeth). This is indeed an utterly great, fictionalised show about recent historical events. If your interests are similar to mine, don't abandon. Watch a little more and you'll be captivated!",10
"Outstanding","I'm surprised to see the amount of negative feedback on season 3. I enjoyed the 1st 2 seasons and was looking forward to seeing new actors portraying the royals with adult children. They did not disappoint.QE2's reign has been relatively drama free, which you could argue makes a boring story, but the writers did an excellent job of conveying that the absence of drama requires great effort and sacrifice. I know many of the storylines were exaggerated but I found them interesting, well written and acted.The one criticism I have is I don't see the real Queen as sullen as Ms Colman portrayed her. I imagine she had many periods where she was conflicted, sad, etc. But we also see her laughing and I wish we saw more lightheartedness. Maybe she'll lighten up in season 4. I'll be watching either way.",10
"S4 paid off the disappointment of S3 restoring the status of S1&2","They captured the events of the 80's in the best way. Excellent casting in Diana, amazing acting from Thatcher. The crown declares that it is back, setting the bar high for the next season and the 90's.",10
"Great Start","I haven't still watched the entire first season of the new Netflix TV show release called 'The Crown' but it sure heads to a great start as much as I've seen of it.This saga about the British Royal Family during its first years can look austere from time to time but that's not what we should expect from this kind of historic show. What we should expect however is a great attention to details and a hint of authenticity throughout it. About those criteria, The Crown is fulfilling them to the perfection. The great attention to history is what keeps me hooked to this wonderful show.The performance of the cast is very sober from all the characters. I have felt that a lot of research has been made to match the cast performance as much to the original people they are incarnating. I'm particularly mesmerized by John Lithgow who is playing Winston Churchill. I have chills seeing this old man, who will always be remembered as the One who stood up to fascism during WW2 to finally triumph against it, trying to update himself to this new era using his intangible character to overcome the various challenges he's facing. I have tears when he's mourning his young secretary who got killed when she got ran over by a bus during the 1952 London Fog which claimed so many lives.In brief the Crown is a show to be seen. I have not still seen it entirely but I truly hope it will keep on.",9
"Pitiful behavior for human beings","I have never been a fan of the monarchy, but this series portrays the queen as lacking any backbone, perpetuating cruelty on her son to satisfy the requirements of a sadistic disloyal husband and the whimsy of an outdated, despicable institution. A complete success.",8
"Season 4 rocks it !!","Almost very accurate events with small details that make you feel like you're living with characters and the actors were more than perfect playing characters like Margret thatcher, princess Diana and even Queen Elizabeth II herself as if they were living with them portraying fabulously every detail about their personality, BRAVO !!",10
"They ROYALLY blew it!","Just erased my entire review and started over. The crux of the matter is that all the new people are too frickin' old.The second season ends with the retirement of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in 1963 and the birth of Prince Edward in 1964.The third season begins starts from 1964 until 1977. Olivia Colman looks every single year of her life and then some. If you look at pictures of Queen Elizabeth II circa 1964, 1965, 1966...she does not look as old as Olivia Colman. Not at all.Olivia Colman's neck sags and she is quite a bit thicker - heftier-looking - than Queen Elizabeth was in 1964 when she was 38 years old. Olivia Colman was well into her 40s when they started filming her episodes and she has been overweight most of her life. Queen Elizabeth had not. Olivia Colman looks like she's in her 50s during this role.Furthermore, she does not carry the role nearly as well as Claire Foy did. She's terrible to watch and listen to and she does not have the subtlety in her acting that Claire Foy did with her character.
Also, ALL of the characters are too old looking for the time period that they are attempting to represent. Queen Elizabeth's secretary and second secretary, Michael Adeane and Martin Charteris look virtually accent compared to their former selves in Season 2...even though just a year has passed.Lord Mountbatten looks like he's well into 70s during Season 3 compared to his actual age at the time which was 64 years old at the beginning of Season 3. Charles Dance was in his 70s at filming (he is a great actor but, also, he looks his age) while Mountbatten was still in his 60s. Dance looks closer to Mountbatten when he was in his 70s - he died when he was 79 years old. He was tragically assassinated.The first 2 seasons deserved 10/10 stars in my opinion; but, the third season for all the above reasons (and especially, because Olivia Colman does not carry the part well at all) is about 6-7/10 stars and I think that that is generous.I very much like Helena Bonham Carter but I adored Vanessa Kirby in the role. The Queen Mother is too old as well in the third season.Tobias Menzies is the right age to play Prince Philip and looks it. I do miss Matt Smith simply because I miss Claire Foy and the chemistry between the two was very good. One could believe that they were truly a couple - Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip - and that they had loved each other for decades, already. A few people commented on how immature that Matt Smith seemed in his role as a seasoned Navy officer who had been through a lot in his life even prior to the Navy. But, I still very much enjoyed him.THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CHEMISTRY BETWEEN COLMAN AND MENZIES. They could have taken two random people off the street and had more believable of a couple than Colman and Menzies. Absolutely horrible casting.Aberfan - the third episode in Season 3 - about the tragedy in Aberfan happened in 1966..not to far away from the end of Season 2 which represented 1964. A lot of the characters were too old for their parts. But, none of them acted as badly as Olivia Colman who comes across as a farmer's wife trying to play a queen.",8
"WHAT WERE THEY THINKING??","I was mesmerized by the first two seasons. Then came Season 3 and I stopped watching the first episode halfway through. Clair Foy was dazzling as Queen Elizabeth, Olivia Coleman looked as though she had a chronic case of constipation. Or, in the words of Dorothy Parker ""Her emotions ran the gamut from A to B "" .
The first Princess Margaret was stunning and charismatic; this season's was frumpy, dumpy and utterly unsympathetic. The geniuses who created the New Coke to replace the old formula apparently worked on this production. They tried to take a winning formula and ended up with an unpalatable mixture unfit for human consumption.",6
"Season 5 Tanked (Rating is for S5 Only)","After 4 seasons of brilliant acting and storytelling, season 5 was a bitter disappointment. I kept hoping that the mediocrity displayed in the first few episodes was the result of the new major cast members getting their bearings. Nope.Each S5 episode languished in needlessly long and tortured dialogue that left me bored, very bored. While some of the storylines promised excitement like Ipatiev House, the viewer's interest was soon extinguished, buried under a pile of pointless conversations that droned on incessantly.About the cast, Dominic West is the most un-Charles like actor imaginable. He is simply awful in the role and comes off as a complete idiot. Imelda Staunton as the Queen is also mis-cast. She is a fine actor but just so very wrong in this role. Her Elizabeth comes off as a moronic cold fish who needs her grandson to explain not all television comes from the BBC and how to change the channel on the royal TV.Two cast members were however absolutely brilliant. Jonathan Pryce as Philip actually makes the man likeable, which is not an easy task! Elizabeth Debicki as Diana is beyond brilliant, she so nails the part you can easily imagine you are watching old footage of the actual person. Well done, both!Let's all hope for a better Season 6 but I for one am not holding my breath.",2
"It went from being the best Netflix series to boring crap in its last seasons","The Crown, for me, was one of the best original series on Netflix. Seasons 1 through 4 were perfect. However, the last two seasons were crap: a boring cast, mediocre scripts and in general each episode was worse than the last. It was not necessary to change the actors from season 4, with makeup they would have looked good.This is unabashed pandering to the British royal family. The unforgivable part is that it's not even entertaining. In fact, it's horribly boring. How this show continues to garner Emmy nods is beyond me and is still not entirely fair to Diana. I'm glad it's ending as the charms of its first seasons have all but faded.",10
"Olivia Colman is disastrous","What a shame! I had earlier reviewed Seasons 1 and 2 as 10/10, and I have retained the high overall rating purely based on my enjoyment of those earlier seasons.
When I heard earlier this year that Olivia Colman was taking over from Claire Foy in Series 3 I was surprised and rather concerned, but decided to give her the benefit of the doubt based on the amazing standard of the two earlier seasons. But my worst fears were realised yesterday on viewing the first episodes of Season 3. This is not just one casting error among many parts - the whole show hangs around the performance of the actress playing the Queen, and Ms Colman, for all her talents and experience as an actress elsewhere, just does not look, behave, move, or sound like the Queen. In 1964, Elizabeth would have been 38 years old, yet in the two episodes I watched yesterday she looked around 20 years older! Surely it would have been possible, and preferable, to have gradually aged Claire Foy, who was so brilliant in all the earlier episodes. The other changes of actors and actresses would all have been perfectly acceptable, but the change in the central character is an unmitigated disaster, and looking at other comments, I see I am far from alone in my reaction. In my opinion this is a catastrophic casting decision!",10
"Marvelous series. Decision to change the cast is sound.","Definitely a sound decision to change the cast ever other season instead of going with kitschy ageing-CGI. Provides for better quality. The people whining about it should get over themselves",9
"Great show, unnecesarily extended.","I am writing this review after watching the last episode of the final season last night, and have never rated previous seasons. Overall, really enjoyes this show, all of it. I did feel, though, that part two of the final season was kind of unnecessary but they went along with it anyway. At times the storyline was slow and dragging, particularly the scenes with William at Uni, and all the nuances behind Kate's mothers plans to force their meeting.The episode about Lady Di's accident, the one about Prince Margaret and the last one are the only memorable ones of the last season. All the rest quite forgettable and boring at times.That being said, performances in this last installment were superior. Imelda Staunton excelled at portraying a nostalgic, emotional and suffering-in-silence Queen, very different to season 5 and to the character played by Olivia Coleman (of whom I am a big fan generally but as Queen Elizabeth found overly stiff and robotic).The actors who played William and Kate very good too, and the resemblances were uncanny. With Harry, however, the casting team seemed not have put the same effort other than finding a red-haired teenager who could be angry and drunk most of the time. His character was the most unlikeable of all, hope that it was not on purpose.Dominic West was OK but he repeatedly makes a gesture with his mouth, involuntary it seemes, which is very distracting and out of character.Elizabeth Debicki, just as Lady Diana did, completely stole the show. Loved her and everything about her performance.",10
"Amazing!","Great show, very close to reality! Absolutely recommend it! Great acting and I feel very saf and sorry for Princess Diana :(",9
"Magic","I'm up-to-date now. I've been binge watching the entire series since last Monday and it's the best since Fargo and Breaking Bad.
I used to detest the Monarchy and the aristocracy when I lived in the UK, but since I left many years ago I've come to appreciate that every country must have a ""Head of State"" system.While I still get upset with the aristocracy, all of their inherited b.s. titles and vast land holdings etc., I have developed a grudging affection for the Monarchy. A grudging warmth and not a little sympathy for their roles in life.For all the wealth and luxury that seems to surround them, they live life in a prison that not one of us could handle without the proper preparation.
You can't say anything, you can't write anything, you can't go anywhere, unless it's been vetted and approved and heaven forbid if you should have a will of your own. Every second of your existence is scheduled, even if it's play time.You certainly can't meet anyone who's not been vetted.You can be either entranced or disgusted by the displays of excess, the cut glass decanters, the footmen , the state dinners, the Rolls Royces ... it just doesn't stop, but not many people could hack it for any length of time before they start to scream for freedom.And so to the series; It's a very rare occurrence in the world of Netflix where they turn out a top quality production, most of them are so bad that you have a monthly wrestle with your conscience to justify the subscription fee.But they've struck gold with this one!The casting and the acting is just about as good as it gets, with the portrayals of both the young Elizabeth and Elizabeth in her later years almost uncanny.
The macho Duke of Ed and the awkward Prince Charles are played brilliantly as are the roles of Margaret and Anne.
I love the way Gillian Anderson takes on the part of Maggie Thatcher, she plays up the absolute phoniness of her entire public image and homes in on the real ruthless and stubborn nasty parts of her personality.
The palace staff and the senior assistants could have been plucked right off the floors of Buckingham Palace and I don't know how they do it, but you'd swear that they were the actual staff, just helping out with the film. Every one of them discreet, posh and quick with the knife.Having said all of that, the most compelling theme of the series is the difficulty of making decisions and keeping the peace both in the family and for the nation
By telling half-truths to the public and stage managing every appearance, we, the great unwashed, have been taken in by the story of an idyllic life where King and Queen adore one another and Prince and Princess were straight out of Disneyland.
With this series we still only see half of the truth, but I do have an increased respect for the job they have to do even though it might seem unnecessary.Can't wait to see how they deal with train-wreck Harry and Meghan... enjoy.",10
"Jane Lapotaire Emmy Nomination for Series 3","Jane Lapotaire after 11 years recovering from a major brain injury made it back on stage at the RSC in Henry V. Then-In The Crown (series 3)She played Princess Alice of Greece and Denmark- the Duke of Edinburgh's mother.And received an Emmy Nomination.Like Princess Alice Jane Lapotaire is deaf.Unlike Princess Alice who was deaf at birth, she can't lip read 3 languages. Princess Alice could lip read Greek, German and English.But Jane Lapotaire had to speak Greek during 3 days of filming. She spent 3 months with a Greek teacher- Ioanna Vasilaki- who was excellent and as stringent about pronunciation as Lapotaire desired her to be.The director Benjamin Caron was top notch and a delight with it.One of Jane Lapotaire's career highlights.Special thanks to Amy Roberts costume designer who made the nun's habits.",10
"10/10 First 2 seasons","Outstanding acting . Claire Foy is adorable in this part .I endeavour to enjoy the next few seasons without her :-(",8
"Season 3 - Colman as an older Margaret would have been better. This is awful","Where is Clair Foy? I started season 3 several times and just cannot get pass Colman as the Queen who looks and sounds more like a 60 year old Margaret. I wish their was a do over. This will plummet they overall average rating of the series.",6
"Some things you can fudge, the eyes are not one of them!","I am a huge fan of The Crown. Seasons 1 and 2 were outstanding, as was the job done by Claire Foy and Matt Smith. Obviously the new cast was going to take some warming up to. The biggest and most glaring problem is Olivia's brown eyes. Everyone on the planet knows that the queens eyes are blue. If you're going to go to the trouble of trying to make the actors look like their roles, even changing the cast every two years to keep up with the aging, then you should not get something so basic as eye colour so wrong. Aside from that, Olivia and Tobias are alright. Hopefully I'll warm up to them as time goes on. The other big glaring difference is that we've gone from 2 full season of episodes between 55 and 60 minutes long to about 45 minutes. I'm pretty sure that there is no shortage of material to write about so it must be about budget. Since my Netflix fee has gone up by $6.00 per month in just a few years, maybe they could afford to give me drama series episodes 60 minutes long.",4
"Season 5 disappointing","There were several things I didn't like about season 5.First - I don't expect total historic accuracy, but why include elements that are clearly not true - such as Charles trying to manipulate Q. Elizabeth out of the throne. Or showing a post divorce conversation between Charles and Diana - that never took place. I also doubt that Diana wanted to bring down the monarchy considering that her own son
was 2nd in line to be king.Second - It was overly soap opera-ish. Almost everything revolved around Charles and Diana. The other seasons had episodes that centered on various aspects of history and politics - like an accident involving miners in Wales, or the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher. Season 5 had practically nothing except for the family dynamics of the royals.And then there is the hypocrisy. The show highlights the willingness of the press to go to any lengths to get demeaning details about the royals (who are, after all, human beings), but then goes on to do the same thing! The show has Margaret or Ann (I forget who) point out how no human being should suffer having a private intimate conversation be published, but Netflix did just that. There was no need to actually include the text of the phone conversation between Charles and Camilla.Lastly, like others I found it hard not to see Prof. Umbridge in Imelda Staunton, and it was hard to see Dominic West as Prince Charles. Every time he came on to screen I had to say... wait, who is this guy? Oh yeh, he's playing Prince Charles.",8
"All actresses changed in season 3","It's terrible ,and there are lots of mistakes ,the Queen has a blue eyes and her sister too when they changed ,their colours of their eyes are chanded too !! And the Queen accent's is very bad and she's not subtitle for role of the Queen ,she hasn't gestured or figures...and everything",10
"great show","I love this show and i'm currently watching the third season but there are some very frustrating details... After the second season with the new actors the queen's and princess margaret's eyes suddenly got brown????? Third season is great so far but because of the eye problem i can't concentrate on the show!! I mean how??? And Claire Foy was so much better than Olivia Colmen...",10
"Series 3","Series 3 is extremely good and I regret to say that it shows how faulty Series1 & 2 were. Prince Philip's role is played by a good actor and not by a marionette. And what about Olivia Coleman? Much better in this series than as Queen Anne.",10
"BEST SERIES IN 21st Century","Beautifully acted, written, and directed. The sheer performances and high production values makes The Crown a must watch. From Claire Foy (2016) to Imelda Staunton (2022-2023). They have beautifully portrayed the aging process of the monarchy and their internal and external battles as members of the royal family. We think we know so much of them but The Crown is at its best it creating those juicy what if fantasies of the most famous family in the world and how these problems have changed the world and the system. The Crown has repeatedly shown the pains and joys of the system particularly the consequences of forbidden marriages. There are storylines like Nazis, Kennedys, Al Fayeds, and Romanovs expand the series. Among all Netflix series, this is the true gem of Netflix.",10
"Astonishing and Brilliant on All Levels","This is without a doubt one of the best series ever on television. So brilliantly conceived, produced, cast, directed and written that it's hard to find words to express my utter amazement. The episodes are well thought out and written with amazing detail to time and place, and crafted in such away to artfully but truthfully tell the viewer what she needs to know without becoming overly bogged down by details or excessive drama. Claire Foy makes a powerful impression as Elizabeth: from shy newlywed to deer-in-the-headlight after her father's unexpected death,and finally to cool and confident monarch committed to doing what she must, even at a personal cost. Matt Smith's performance as the often tactless, very plain speaking but always well meaning Prince Philip, the most forward thinking family member at the time, is terrific. But far and away, Jared Harris' understated George the VI will no doubt be considered legendary. He captures the essence of that King: a fragile, gentle soul who was thrust into a role he never wanted and for which he had no preparation, but somehow managing to do a fine job despite the odds. If the scene at the Sandringham Christmas party doesn't move you, you have no heart. So sit back and be transported to another time and place. You'll probably end up binge watching this masterpiece. I can't wait for Season 2. Kudos to Netflix for lavishly funding this production.",9
"Love it","I absolutely love the characters and ambience of season one and two. I ended up in my colouring books with season 3 why didn't they just make Claire foy look old with make up and make her in season 3.",10
"Just Finished Season 4","An outstanding season. Each episode pretty much stands on its own and got better as the series progressed. As I watched each one, I thought ""this is my favorite"", but the next one was always better in a different way. Actors are superb. Every one of the principal characters deserves some kind of award. Netflix scored big on this one.",8
"Left out of the credits","In the third (I think) episode of Season 4, A rat scurries across the carpet of a large room inside Buckingham palace. That says more about the shabbiness of parts of the palace than Michael Fagan ever could. It makes me wonder why the rat was left out of the credits, given its contribution to the series.Most of the acting is superb, the rat included. The exception must be Josh O'Connor's Prince Charles. The moping hangdog act gets very old very quickly. Every other flawed Royal seems to have some sort of soft or wise side to them. Maybe Prince Chuck has no redeeming qualities in real life?",7
"Well-made!","Very stable show) it's quite interesting, well-made by all seasons. It has some prolonged episodes but there are so much ahead))I liked first season the most! I really annoyed 1-2 seasons cast but 3-4 seasons cast is not that bad) Partly it's really-really good!In 4 season I expected and wanted more of Diana but I suppose we will see it in the 5th.Decorations and costumes are just perfect.I can't say it's a perfect show but it's pretty good. It's not always so much interesting but interesting enough to watch 4 seasons and be waiting to next one))I would recommend it to people who really wants to know the history/politic history of Great Britain.",5
"Disappointing 5th season","The Crown used to be such an amazing series. This season goes to great lengths to make Charles look good and Diana look like an unhinged, childish woman. Her popularity as Princess of the People is completely overlooked. Even the relationship with her sons is tarnished. This season makes it look like William was embarrassed by his mother! That's unacceptable. One forgets that Charles was the one who cheated on Diana from the very first day of their marriage. Who wouldn't be traumatized after that? I am so disappointed by the direction the show has taken. I don't know whether someone in the royal family pressured the writers so Charles would look better as he's now king but that's really a let down. Should they even bother with a final season? I guess they'll disparage Diana completely. Terrible!",8
"Season 3 casting","Olivia Colman is a serious casting mistake. She doesn't have the subtlety that Claire Foy had. Her prominent teeth mean she often gapes when she's finished speaking and her posh voice sounds stagey and makes it more of an impression that an impersonation. Foy could speak with apparent strong determination yet her sensitive nature was covered with a thin veneer.
Many of the performances in this season are bordering on caricature. Some almost pantomime. This is a shame because the first two seasons were almost faultless.
Bonham Carter is unfortunate in having to follow the extraordinary performance of Vanessa Kirby who was a good likeness facially to Margaret.",9
"Believe The Hype","I had attempted watching this back in 2017, but fell asleep. The addition of Diana and the royal family's reaction to the latest season is what made me want to give it another try. What helped me enjoy the first 3 seasons more is that I watched a documentary on the royals early in the year. Seeing these historical events re-enacted kept me entertained. However, without being familiarized to the subject matter, I think the slow moments would've had me giving up on the show. It can get really slow in some moments, which is one of the biggest flaws in the show for me.The acting is fantastic. When the change from Claire Foy to Olivia Coleman happened, I wasn't feeling it at first because it made no sense to me. I know the change is done to illustrate aging but it's like she didn't just age, she changed completely. I thought some magic from the make-up department would've aged Claire Foy a bit more so there's not a drastic change in appearance, but Olivia Coleman's phenomenal acting helped me see past the obvious physical difference. There's a reason this woman has won so many awards, she truly immerses herself in the role. She shows more emotion than the actual Queen. She's fantastic. A usual favorite for me is Helena Bonham Carter, she's one of my favorite actresses of all time, but she's not a convincing older Princess Margaret. I think Vanessa Kirby did a better job at it than Carter. When she comes on the screen, I only see Helena Bonham Carter not Princess Margaret. Just seems off. The actress playing Diana does her best. She doesn't entirely capture Princess Diana but you can tell she's trying. Props to her for doing so cos Princess Diana is a ""damned if you, damned if you don't"" character to play; you never know how people are going to react. Finally, it has to be said how great John Lithgow was as Winston Churchill, but no one's surprised with that one.The cinematography is amazing, you get movie quality episodes with this show. The way the stories are told has you understand why these people are the way they are. Still, like the rest of the world, I don't like Charles and I'll never forgive them for the way they treated Diana. Charles was a grown man, sure he had an un-perfect emotional upbringing, but at the end of the day he was old and should've taken the 'L' (letting go of his royal status) to be with his ugly love of his life Camilla instead of gaslighting and tormenting the prettiest and warm hearted woman to walk into that palace. From the looks of it, he's never going to be king anyway. No one will ever accept him or his ugly lady. That's karma ladies and gentlemen.The only fictitious elements I can find in this show is the dialogue and intimate scenes but other than that, the events all check out, they're based on real things that happened. The royals didn't react til this latest season because they know it wasn't right how they treated Princess Diana, but the damage was done. The event is still fresh in the collective memory. It's a new world, we see past the smoke and mirrors crap. With that being said, I can't wait for season 5.",2
"Wonderful cast","I have tried too write this a few times. I am against the institution of the Royal family. However, I believe this amazing drama, goes beyond that. Yes, there is massive poetic licence. Yes, I am sure most of the information was untrue. However, season 3 living and understanding a slight of the monarchy in the UK, it was so amazingly well acted. Olivia Coleman as always, is amazing. However serious hats off 2 Tobias McKenzie, wow. I actually don't care about the facts( as I am more than capable of finding them on my own), simple. Amazing show.",10
"Why have I not watched this till now???","This show has so much to offer. I realize they didn't know what they were thinking, but had an amazing amount of details in their whereabouts from day to day. Piecing the emotional feeling that may have been about is a great stretch, but considering that every public detail is taken into account, it's hard to believe they were that inaccurate about how people feel just in general as humans, regardless of royalty or not. Not many shows can make you feel the way this does about actual historical shows.",10
"A masterpiece","The Crown is just excellent! The attention to detail and the amazing perfomances by every single actor makes all seasons so far interesting and captivating. It makes us feel ""closer"" to the royal family and we get the historical and personal/emotional perspective of the events.One of the best drama series, just perfect!",9
"The Crown's Graceful Tribute to Princess Diana's Tragic End","In its latest season, ""The Crown"" unveils a masterful portrayal of Princess Diana's tragic demise, transcending the boundaries of mere entertainment to deliver a poignant and profoundly emotional experience. The series, known for its historical accuracy and compelling storytelling, reaches new heights in its depiction of this pivotal moment in royal history.From the outset, it is evident that the creators approached Princess Diana's narrative with a delicate touch, navigating the intricacies of her life and untimely death with both respect and empathy. The finale, marking the end of an era for the series, is a testament to the show's ability to engage viewers on a visceral level, transcending the screen and leaving a lasting impact.One of the standout aspects of this season is the exceptional performance by Elizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana. Debicki's portrayal is a tour de force, capturing the essence of Diana's vulnerability, strength, and the complexity of her public and private struggles. The nuances in her performance elevate the narrative, making it a truly immersive experience for the audience.The episode depicting Diana's death is a heart-wrenching masterpiece in itself.

The show doesn't shy away from addressing the complexities of her relationship with the royal family, offering a nuanced perspective that goes beyond the headlines of the past.In the midst of the tragedy, the series also manages to pay homage to the resilience of the human spirit. It captures the collective grief felt by people worldwide and serves as a reminder of the profound impact Princess Diana had on shaping the monarchy and redefining the role of a royal figure.Beyond the performances and narrative, the cinematography deserves special commendation. The visual storytelling in the final episodes is nothing short of breathtaking. The use of symbolism, such as the dimming of lights and the fading of colors, adds a layer of sophistication to the storytelling, amplifying the emotional resonance of the series.""The Crown"" has often been lauded for its commitment to historical accuracy, and this season is no exception. The meticulous research shines through in the details, from the recreation of iconic events to the authenticity of the costumes and settings. This commitment to historical integrity enhances the viewer's immersion in the world of the royal family and contributes to the overall richness of the storytelling.In conclusion, the last season of ""The Crown"" stands as a poignant tribute to Princess Diana, skillfully blending historical events with a profound exploration of the human experience. The exceptional performance by Elizabeth Debicki, thoughtful direction, and unwavering commitment to accuracy make it a standout in the realm of historical dramas. As the series bids farewell to an era, it leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of its viewers, proving once again that ""The Crown"" is not just a show; it's an emotional journey through the corridors of history.",10
"I did not expect to be interested, and ended up riveted.","My position on the Monarchy has always been benign indifference. I don't hate them, I don't collect plates with their faces on. They exist in the background of my life, with little relevance to it, and do not require or provoke much in the way of a personal opinion from me. So when episode one started because Netflix thinks it needs to make choices in my life that I am not necessarily okay with it making, I only began watching because my hands were full and I couldn't turn it off. By the time that episode ended, I'd texted my husband that we'd be watching The Crown that night, so I didn't end up a mad number of episodes ahead of him when he finally caved and started watching it, too.The first, immediate impression is how well it works as a period(s) piece. All the pageantry and mannerisms keep the royals seemingly rooted in the past, but outside the palace the atmosphere rarely belies the unfolding events. The second effect was being unaccountably heartbroken to realise we wouldn't get much of King George VI, as portrayed by Jared Harris (and later, equally delighted that he had a couple more episodes and decent flashback cameos).The series isn't perfect, there are moments when it's like watching a soap opera with royalty in it... but the casting, atmosphere, attention to detail and choice of focus of events have been absolutely on point. But from the moment John Lithgow turns up as Winston Churchill, you abandon the idea of marathoning The Good Place for a second time, and quietly surrender to the inevitability of 3 seasons of watching something both strangely familiar and oddly outlandish. I am still not a Royalist, but I am a good deal better informed about my country's political history and the context between it and the royal household, and more likely to remember there are actual humans behind the headlines.",8
"Sensational !","What a beautiful show ! Everything is at its best ! Script, acting, costumes, casting ....sensational ! Of course, all of us fall in love with Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth...but, this is life, people get older....and the characters need new actors...a bit of disapointment, but we will like the ""new"" queen in time....
I just saw the teaser of season 4.....what a nice surprise : great cast for Lady D and Margaret Thatcher ! I cant wait November 15th !!!!!
Thank you Netflix !",8
"Excellent but ...","Seasons 1-3 were great but I found Season 4 lacking. Let's hope Season 5 returns to the magic shown in the first 3 seasons.",8
"Loved the beginning... what happened?","I loved the first two series. I've been binge watching the third season and it's just boring. I don't see chemistry between anyone but Charles and Anne. Now Elizabeth and Margaret don't have blue eyes. It seems ridiculous (and somewhat insulting) that this very simple detail was blatantly ignored. Some of these episodes make Elizabeth look like a horrible person and a terrible mother. I understand this isn't a documentary and that some artistic license was taken, but they could have gotten a bit closer to the actual truth of a few instances. Hopefully, the fourth series will bring in new actors.",6
"Stop watching after season 3","The first three seasons of The Crown are incredible. Watch them. Re-watch them. But what ever you do, DON'T watch season 4. All that engaged you in the first three seasons' disappears. The scripts, the acting and most importantly, the story line. The series goes from interesting historical pageant to astoundingly bad trash viewing in a nanosecond. From Masterpiece theater to Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Take my advice.",5
"A royal treat in acting","Extraordinary talented pool of actors , historical accurate plot, cunning cinematography,and gripping nerve racking dialogues -- this is season 3. Olivia Colmen and Helna bonham Carter gives performances that will give you master class in acting, this might be their career best performances which tells a lot about these academy award nominated and winner artists.",8
"Acting!","Beside the great writing and cinematography, it really impresses me how they were able to gather such brilliant cast in one series. A great joy to watch.",9
"A Masterpiece","The Crown is beautifully scored, well written, terrifically cast, superbly acted and perfectly produced and directed. It will long stand as a crowning achievement in the history of television.",8
"Superb - simply riveting","Love this show and I'm learning so much about the Royal family that I didn't know before. Perfectly acted, portrayed and written.",10
"Outstading series, outstading performances.","This is simply something you MUST watch. Telling a real story can be really hard and specially if that story is the story of the Queen of England. I got to discover many things that I didnt know before watching this.Bow down to the acting on this series. Claire Foy, Miss Olivia Colman and Imelda Staunton are simply outstading in their roles, and a special mention to the casting team but their resemblance with the Royals are sometimes frightening.My personal favourite season and plotline, the Diana part, Elizabeth, you are truly a legend.Watch this if you havent already. You wont regret it.",10
"I love it","What great acting. I love how inside stories are told with outside happeningsI think our Dutch monarchy has enough content as well!",8
"This is history in the making ...","Now this series is about to come to an end ... I just want to say that this series has captivated the hearts and minds of humans all around the world whose lives have been shaped by the British throne ( for better or worse ) , as well as created some of the best scenes and acting in television history . The earlier seasons really made me believe and have a devotion to the crown to make me believe ( as people did at that time ) that Claire Foy's Queen Elizabeth was someone I would die to protect and proud to call her my Queen . Olivia Coleman's Queen had me feeling calm and stable as her and Phillip laughed and enjoyed life . Once we hit Imelda's mature and stoic Queen I felt the comfort of being stable and secure ...... until season 6. We all know what's coming and I know that we will not be disappointed by what the genius Peter Morgan has install for us !!! This is one , if not the best , writing , directing and casting the television family has ever seen or has had in history . It is a much watch for all us historical fiction fanatics as well as those who just love a good drama.",10
"Excellent","From start to finish I found The Crown to be both entertaining and thought provoking.I am well aware the series is not based entirely on fact, lots of artistic licence used as we know how private the Royal Family are when not in the public eye.But even with all that, its a wonderful insight in what could be happening, and whether its right or wrong, its still good entertainment.The last series is possibly the best. I am not sure why so many are suggesting its slow and badly cast, okay, its nt the best Harry, but I guess its because people know what Harry looks like. But the same people are not so quick to say there same about King George, but then they don't have much of a clue what he really looked like I suppose.The death of Margaret was particularly poignant. Followed by the Queen Mother, with Imelda Staunton's acting so flawless that her facial expression speaks a thousand words. You sit there sometimes believing she really is the Queen.William is the most believable, he portrays well what a lad of his age losing his Mum would be like, trust me, I know first hand. Harry plays well too, a younger lad not so affected because of his age, trying to support his brother. Their collective and understandable hatred for the press and William's need for privacy not granted really gets you ""right there"".Across the various series the casting was excellent. Clearly Netflix wanted to produce a ""no expense spared"" series, shown both with the casting, the sets and the flawless use of CGI and library footage where it mattered. It's hard to find anything negative to say if truth be known.I'm giving this series 10/10, and that doesn't happen very often. Unfeeling, anti-royalist, and those watching only because their partner has it on need not apply.",10
"Like every other decent show...","This show was highjacked by that group of Hollywood ideologues that insists on rewriting history. Queen Elizabeth was never an activist and I don't think she hated Margaret Thatcher the way the show portrays in season 4. I really enjoyed the first 3 seasons of the show because it was so well presented in a more-or-less honest way. Delicate issues were handled carefully and much was left to our imagination. Not so in Season 4. Here QEII is a full on leftist activist. It is uncomfortable because it is so false. If the producers had to show us their contempt for Thatcher, there were so many honest ways to do that. Thrusting this belief system on the queen with no proof is like the fake news we see on BBC. So sad but definitely predictable. In the late 1970's the world was in a deep recession with inflation. We called it stagflation. Interest rates and unemployment were very high. There were long lines for gas in the US. That's when the world turned right and elected Reagan and Thatcher who pulled the western world out of the economic doldrums. The Crown is rewriting history for 2020 political purposes. I was there and this show is misrepresenting history.",7
"The death of the series - Season 5.","I have watched and loved this series until now. The only actors that are made to look like the real people are the queen and Diana. The others are hard to tell what person they are supposed to be playing unless one of the other characters say their name.The writing is slow and boring. I gave up in the middle of ep. 2 - didn't realize it was supposed to be prince Phillip. - I guess I missed someone saying his name and the actor didn't look even vaguely like Prince Phillip.Fun while it lasted. Not so much now. I am sad to see it end on such a sour note. I assume their will not be a season 6.",1
"Yes","All the right parts to make a good drama. Well written and acted. Amazing show",10
"Classy one and history buffs would really love it","Just completed the the whole series and I can say this one is for the history buffs. The series is carefully crafted and I wouldn't say all the things depicted are super accurate. Of course, many events are fictionalized and only the royal family knows the reality.All the lead characters performed nicely. Kudos to the production design team for showcasing some amazing buildings and the camera team also deserve applause. The locations were simply superb.I always wanted a historical series like this where they take us back to the 20th century. The episode 'Ipatiev House' (S05 E06) is my favorite so far. The episodes take you through events like Kennedy Assassination, Harold Wilson's reign, the Suez crisis, Aberfan disaster, etc. A must-watch for history buffs. Thanks.",10
"Why I like the Crown Tv series","Although the Crown Tv series does not convey a great story and sometimes seem a little bit boring but it is a well-written and well-made one. Cinematography is very good. Design and performances are really good. All-in-All it is a pleasing visual experience. Olivia Colman is a great actress but I still think Claire Foy was a much better choice for the Queen's role and I regret she left the tv series.",8
"Excellent Drama","Well done in all aspects. I'm sure that a bit of poetic licence was used, but not enough to cause the series to considered fiction. I enjoyed every episode. I believe that most viewers will feel the same.",10
"The cast change lost me!","Sorry this is a good show but it was so hard to watch with the new cast change so I just gave up on it sorry.
If you can deal with fast change then I would continue.",8
"S04 made me cut down a star","I only started watching ' The Crown ' 1 week ago and I finished all episodes all seasons today and need I say that it is a visual marvel along with excellent story telling and the emotional range showed by the entire caste ? S1 and S2 are particularly very close to my heart as Claire Foy gives the Queen's character a certain charm that Olivia Colman could not ,regardless doing a wonderful job at her part. The reason I give this 9 stars is that I was watching this show as a feel good show but the last season made me resent the royal family in not a good way. Can't wait to see what's in it next ( well we do have some idea about what's next ) and it's safe to say it will be painful wait till 2022.",10
"The Crown is strangely enticing","Whilst I am not particularly interested in Royalty and such I find the Crown engrossing. I think the real reason is the superb cast and obvious amount that has been spent on the details. 90 % of the portrayals are totally believable and I think that's really how you judge a good production. Claire Foy does an impressive job as the Queen. She brings a lovely vulnerable side to the character that makes Lisbeth seem very human. Vanessa Kirby as Princess Margret is sultry and untamed. The other stand out portrayal is Alex Jennings as the abdicated King. Watch it, you won't be disappointed.",8
"Costume design was incredible","1. Clare Foy was phenomenal as queen Elizabeth, however i agree with a previous reviewer who stated that Olivia Coleman always looked as though she was confused in season four. That was annoying. 2. Gillian Anderson was absolutely brilliant as Margaret Thatcher, AMAZING. 3. The costume design was incredible in all seasons, but I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the costume design for lady diana in season four. 4. All in all a remarkable production, a tad bit boring in some parts which I fast forwarded, but a solid and quality series. 5. The privilege these people require however is mind boggling.",9
"Seductive.","I am not a royalist by any means. In fact, I often wonder why kings and queens exist in the 21st century. I marvel that they don't come to their senses themselves and join the human race as it is. So, I did balk at watching this Netflix offering at first.I am glad I dipped my toe in by watching the first episode. I was immediately seduced by the richness of its writing, its editing, its presentation and its talent. I was also rewarded with a balanced view of the monarchy as institution vs. personality. Flawed and tortured human beings poured into rigid traditional roles. Claire Foy is simply remarkable. Matt Smith is a perfect foil. Victoria Hamilton and Eileen Atkins provide weighty and humorous ballast. The cast is too deep to acknowledge individually here, but any fan of British productions will be wowed. Alex Jennings deserves mention as David, Duke of Windsor. Vanessa Kirby shines as Princess Margaret.Well worth a Netflix binge. We highly recommend it.",6
"Great 1st Two Years, Then a Slide Downward","The 1st two years were very well done. Claire Foy and Matt Smith were excellent and extremely believable. Their portrayals and demeanor were spot on. The supporting cast did equally well. The only disappointment was the end of season 2 when the director painted Philip in such a poor light. It took a huge downturn with season 3. Suddenly, all new actors are used. The new Queen looks nothing like a three year older version of the Queen at the end of season 2. Her nasally, whiny voice is annoying and her demeanor is lacking. The new Philip mumbles his way through his lines and has no verve, even 'just 3 yrs later'. The height differential is noticeably off as well between the Queen and Philip - he's not tall enough or she's too tall. The bad icing on the cake was having Helena Bonham Carter play Margaret. She's a great actress, but seriously - a 54 y/o playing the 35 y/o younger sister? Not to mention the facial structure is all wrong. In actuality, all of the characters looked way too old for their 1965 selves. And the choice to carry through the fictional story line of Philip's possible involvement in the sex scandal was a poor tack to take. Bottom line - 1st two years rate a ""9"", after that, it drops to ""4"". Too bad as the initial couple of years were outstanding!",1
"This rating is for Season 5","I started to watch The Crown one day during the pandemic and fresh out of major surgery. I was desperate to find ANYTHING to watch. It seemed boring, and I was never a huge history buff. I was so shocked at how much I actually enjoyed the show. I became hooked. The lives of people who always seemed so one dimensional to me living in a castle cutting ribbons, were actually complex. There was a lot I didn't know. I also loved the cast. They showed imperfect people, yet you could still sympathize with them. They seemed to truly embody their roles. This became one of my favorite shows ever.I have been anxiously awaiting Season 5 for years. With events such as the infamous annus horiblis 1992, the divorce of 3 of 4 children, the Tampongate, and tell all interview wars it was the most eventful season yet. A lot of the reviews said it was like a trashy soap opera. I immediately thought this is going to be epic. I stayed up until 3am so I could watch the minute the series was available (I know, it's a little much). But I was really looking forward to it. I thought episodes would be available on a weekly basis. When I saw the whole season immediately available, I felt like Christmas came early (again a little much). I immediately dove in.I can't begin to express my disappointment. This is hands down the worst season ever! If the first few seasons of the series had been anything like this, I would've never became a fan of the show. I feel like someone could have made their own low budget series in their house and did a better job. Seriously, ANYONE could have done a better job. The entire season falls completely flat. I was planning on completely binge watching the season. It took me several days to finish, because I had to force myself to sit through these horrible episodes. They are all bad.The new cast is absolutely awful! A large part of the reason that the series is so successful is due to the cast. They truly embodied the roles. Both actresses who played Queen Elizabeth II depicted her as human. She was born into privilege and has been controversial throughout the years. But you see her as human, and overall a decent person who does the best that she can with what she has. The rest of the cast shows the ups and downs of supporting her and her role as queen, while trying to live their own lives. Staunton is almost robotic. She is very cold, unfeeling, and emotionless. She said 1992 was the most difficult year of her life. This series makes it hard to sympathize with her at all. She seems to be a little frustrated with the situations, but kind of shrugs them off. The actress who plays Diana has been praised, but to me she did not do well at all. This is another person who really went through it during this time frame. The actress who plays Diana makes her quirky, odd, awkward, petty, and really dumb. The best description I can give is like how Kristen Stewart is in the Twilight movies. She does all of those quirky unnatural jerks and stutters, and is just weird. Diana constantly puts on way too much black eye liner and does these unnecessary floor glances constantly. It's supposed to be her being ""dough eyed"", but it's really laughable, but then starts to get extremely annoying. The actor who Charles doesn't really look like him, and doesn't know what he's trying to be. Everyone else is just kind of there. They don't get enough time to really even give you any impression of them. I don't think the writers even know if they were supposed to be antagonists or protagonists. The past casts did a great job of looking like and even gaining the mannerisms of the characters they were playing. That's not so much the case in season 5.The pacing and relevance in the past series have been great. They take enough time to inform you of what happened, but not too long to where you lose interest. I feel like they were on par with how much time to spend on each issue. They even threw a few episodes in to discuss controversial topics that not a lot of people knew about, such as the Kennedy episode. In this season the first 3 episodes are like watching paint dry. Nothing really happens. They do an entire episode on the life story of Mohamed Al Fayed. Who cares?! They gloss over EVERY major event happening directly to the main characters in a matter of minutes, sometimes seconds. They talk about Fergie for all of 30 seconds. They never mention Edward, or anything about Andrew. They mention Anne's divorce and desire to be remarried in all of a minute or 2. I would much rather see an episode on Fergie, Andrew, and Anne than Mohamed Al Fayed. Then like I mentioned the infamous 1992 is glossed over in a matter of minutes. They literally could have done a whole season on it. They also spend a lot of time on Charles wanting to modernize royalty, and Camilla Parker Bowles and their ""tragic"" true love story. They make both of them seem like they have always stood up for what is right, even though they were persecuted for it. And they were just lightly joking and doing what every couple in love should do when their famous conversation was leaked. For the rest of the series, They introduce a topic, then don't elaborate or tell what happened.Overall this season is just an absolute waste, that does not do the show or the events any justice in any way, shape, or form. It manages to get rid of everything that you love about the series. I can't believe the same person created this season. The difference is night and day, and not in a good way. You never really know which direction things are supposed to go in.",9
"Captivating, Controversial but compelling","This review covers the story in Series 4, which seems to be the most controversial series yet, perhaps because of the introduction of Diana Spencer and Mrs Thatcher. It continues to be a mandatory tv series, the fascination of the royal family for viewers everywhere is a rare phenomenon.
Yet the secret of the series is not just top notch writing and production, it also attracts the best in acting talent and spares no cost in getting everything, including settings absolutely right. And it has paid off handsomely, as audience ratings show.
We all know it is fictionalized but debate still rages over issues like Charles' affair with Camilla and the depiction of Mrs Thatcher as a godlike icon. Personally I find Gillian Anderson a somewhat overrated actress as she appears to swallow her words, but the rest of the cast is exceptional, even the young Emma Corrin as Diana. I think the whole nation will go into mourning when this exceptional series comes to an end. This has to be the one series that confirms Netflix coming of age as a series producer in its own right.",10
"New cast but the Crown continues to be brilliant","The new series three has a different cast, but is just if not better than before. Olivia Colman is great as the Queen and Helena Bohnam Carter as Princess Margaret. I think the fact that I can remember the events it covers from my own memories as a child, particularly the tragedy of Aberfan. I was 7 years old when it happened, the same age as many of the children who died, I watched the funeral with my mum on our tv and we sobbed together and I remember her hugging me all the while. Watching them line up those poor people to introduce to the Queen broke my heart, how could they make those grieving people stand on ceremony like that? But this series is showing things as they were, not how we would like them to be.I'm the same age as Princess Diana was and lived not far from her before she married. I think here fact becomes mixed with fiction. It was clear Charles and Diana were mismatched from the start and were very unhappy. How can anyone know the exact words to private conversations that happened between Charles and Diana or Charles and Ann etc etc? No one was innocent in this, but the common approach is to put all the blame on Charles and sanctify Diana. They base this on an interview Diana gave to Martin Bashir on BBC1. Well we all now know what drove her to say what she said.This is a great series as long as people don't accept everything as fact.",10
"Long Has She Reigned","""The Crown"" is actually a gem in television history. A lavish, very expensive retelling of the life of Queen Elizabeth II. It may not be completely accurate in exploring the life events of the Queen, but it sure works as an inside in the mind of one of the most important women in history. Claire Foy has taken us through a journey in the earlier years of the Queen's reign, and her performance was so powerful and extraordinary that she managed to breathe life into the entire series, she is the forfe upon the whole endeavour is resting. Olivia Colman took over to present a somewhat more firm figure, a Queen that's been a Queen for a while now and knows the job very well. Series 5 and 6 have somewhat shifted the focus to her extended family and children and their dramatic lives. Elizabeth Debicki has stolen the spotlight as Princess Diana, but that is actually very fitting as it is what in reality happened with Diana herself. Series 6 actually was heavily focused on Diana and her tragic end. But as it turns out, in the end, the show runners knew that the only and real focus of the series could ever be one. ""The Crown"" was first and foremost a series about the person that is wearing the Crown and that is Queen Elizabeth. And the penultimate episode of this series celebrates her, and her long reign and reminds us all why she has reigned for so long. Because as it turns out she was the only person responsible enough to carry the burden of wearing the Crown. And she did so valiantly. Imelda Staunton proves in this final episode that she is a brilliant choice for the older Queen. She has grasped her character magnificently. One of the greatest series ever made!",8
"Good but unfair for Diana to be presented like a lunatic","I loved the series and watched it in a few nights. I have two notes to mention on season 5.Number one, I have never understood that prince Charles was so charismatic or handsome as everyone saysin the show.Number two, was princess Diana really so damaged ? I saw nothing good about her in the show, nothing even close to what I had in mind about her.They presrent her as an insane , needy, spoiled, weak and revengeful girl , that wants to desrtoy the royal family for no reason. She was accused for hugging this kid with HIV, like she did it to look more sympathetic on the press, and nobody denied this accusation, not even hershelf. I thought Diana was a powerful, strong, kind and funny woman. They only showed her kindness as her only asset.On the other hand, the prince was presented as the good guy who suffers next to this annoying crazy woman, like nothing is his fault. On top of that they want us to believe that he was charming and charismatic. No, nobody believes that.",8
"Great until the cast change","Fabulous! Have been enjoying this immensely until the cast change. If the queen is only 39 why is she and everyone else suddenly look 50 plus? Helen bingeing carter as Princess Margaret is a horrible choice. She's always the same loon from the Tim Burton movies. Bad, bad choice. I have suddenly lost interest as the cast no longer has any charm. Hoping the Diana years brings this show back to greatness.",8
"A worthwhile web series","My complaint with this series is that they don't show Month and Year and some other events that happened during that timeline properly; so that to digest transition of actors plus to cope up with some stories is not easy as a viewer.Second, Family Tree of British Royal Family is never shown properly.",10
"Delightful","Delightful, as an American I have always been curious about the roll of the Royal family in the UK. As I know some of these are scripted scenes it is insightful on the works of The Crown in the UK. The series does add a bit of magic to the Royal family. Worth the watch if you have ever been curious.",9
"The Crown continues its masterpiece!","Watched the newest season of The Crown on Thanksgiving Day 2020. I was RIVETED. I'm a HUGE admirer of Princess Diana and couldn't wait to watch!
Casting and acting are top notch, especially the actress playing Diana, very convincing. I am not a political person, so there was a bit too much Margaret Thatcher and not enough Diana. I do wonder, of course, how accurate it is. But it was excellent. It also made me sad, but that emotion is central to the story of Diana's life. Highly recommended watching to escape from a horrible year 2020!",7
"Unfortunate change of cast!","Totally dislike the change of cast starting season 3!",3
"Bad casting in a dark and dreary production","Any stars I give for this series 5 production will be for the production values only. The actors efforts/roles varied from competent to terrible. By far the worst was the utterly wrong casting of Imelda Staunton as the Queen. In every scene she remained Imelda Staunton as her likeness both in looks and manner was so unlike Queen Elizabeth. The character was portrayed as dowdy, sour, unemotional and unappealing. My perception and observations of the Queen were that she was beautiful, engaging , strong not sour and withdrawn, had charisma and fulfilled her public meetings and duties with grace and charm. There was a reason she was so widely and strongly loved by her people. Nothing of this came through. If the intention was to show her as a rather unpleasant, unemotional and unattractive woman it succeeded. This dour and dark adaptation left me cold. It was so unrelated to the reality it was a farce. What a waste when the real story was so interesting.",10
"Season 3","Oscar winner Olivia Colman is very very good. Time for her to become a Emmy winner. Every one is at there best and the show is at its best.",8
"The first two seasons far better","Where for season 1 and 2 a rating of 10 would be deserving, season 3 is around 7
Why? The season starts around 1964 when the Queen was 38, and the actor looks 50ish
Princess Margaret had a very graceful figure, not this actor, sorry",10
"Absolutely brilliant, and realistic","I am not British, and have no general interest in British monarchy... but this series more than exceeded my expectations! It's breathtaking visually, dialogues are amazing, and while there is hardly any story per episode, you don't feel bored, but instead hooked with strong binge-worthiness. How modern kings and queens live itself is pretty interesting.And while many people have simply rated this 1/10 because ""it glorifies monarchy"", it really doesn't. It lays bare how sham all this is. How monarchy continues to charm and fool and adapt to stay relevant and continue its existence. And it's terribly wretched to have to watch every single one of these people who have been given life on platter, with all luxuries of world for free, trying very hard to ruin it. Every single one of Philip or Maraget or Charles or Anne or Harry or Diana intentionally make wrong choices while knowing what's at stake and still then blame everyone else but themselves. While the Queen herself was charming and noble in first two seasons, she also showed cold harsh demeanour in third and fourth seasons, to the extent that many problems can be attributed to her brushing them under carpet.And yes, I did check whether it's accurate or not. And while there are some minor errors of dates and accuracy, it's 90% accurate and good enough for all purposes except for school essay or court evidence.",8
"was a solid 10","This was for me was a solid 10 star until they made the huge mistake of recasting instead of aging the actors. They had a perfect 10 show going, you dont mess with that unless you are just plain nuts.What were they thinking? They didnt even recast so the actors had any physical or acting .similarities. Blue eyes even became brown, tall and shapely to short and fat!! HBC is totally miscast and so opposite of how Vanessa portrayed Princess Margaret it is cringe worthy. Sorry Helena, you are great in so many roles but this part is so wrong for you and you are too unlike Vanessa to pull it off. Olivia portrays a decent Queen and would have been fine in a different series but she differs in look and character from Claire that you just cant believe it is supposed to be the same person. As far as Gillian goes, while some say she did great, others and myself disagree. I have one word for her portrayal of Thatcher, OVER~ACTED! So badly in fact, you ask yourself how could anyone have any admiration for the iron lady and not just find her to be one big conceited, arrogant pain the but you wish would just be quiet and go away already. But besides all this I love the series, just not HBC and GA performances in this, they alone gravely dropped the ratings. Thankfully, the series itself is so good you still are glued to the screen, even if you cringe now n then when the bad casting has a moment of how obviously the miscast is.",10
"Excellent and so well acted","I have now seen all 5 series and I am amazed at Dominic West's excellent performance as Charles. Much better looking, but he gets his voice, delivery and mannerisms perfectly.Credit too to Jonny Lee Miller for actually making me quite fancy John Major! I know that Sir John has voiced some objections to this series, but I thought it showed him in a very good light, including his very warm relationship with the Queen during troubled times.Elizabeth Debecki was also excellent as Princess Diana.I thought the episode featuring Princess Margaret and Peter Townshend was very poignant.All in all this is a brilliant drama with wonderful performances and the production values and music are top class.",10
"Hits it out of the park again for the crown!!!","Total must see!! Olivia Coleman and helena Bonham Carter are great and just rises to their greatness... nice to see tobias in a good guy character..",9
"Part 4 is the answer","It is time to get to know Princess Diana, because we did not know the lifestyle in England in the palace of the royal family, we did not know who to believe, but today with this series and highlighting that era, I clearly see that Camilla played an important role in the deterioration of the late princess's life She did not like the prince and did not deserve him, but she agreed to be the lover because he loved her and made her important, and Diana was oppressed by the family and Charles was wronged a lot, she lived her life looking for love and died and did not really got it.",7
"This is how you create a TV series","The Crown is the benchmark for great TV Series. Claire Foy is outstanding as Elizabeth II. Backed up by some brilliant performances by her fellow actors. Well written and beautifully crafted story telling.I can't recommend how good this TV series is. Just watch it. You won't be disappointed.",2
"Disappointed with season 3","The Crown has absolutely been my favourite show. Acting, dialogue, writing, cinematography, ect., so it's so terribly disappointing to see the third season not live up to the standard. Great actors that I love are in the third, but it lacks the prestige the other two seasons had. There is something definitely missing now having the same actors. Could they not age them? Honestly the eye colours are completely different. Still a wonderful show, but slightly disappointed.",9
"Series 5 Tedious in the extreme","I liked series 1-3 a lot but The Crown has lost its glitter the last two series. In Series 5 some wonderful actors are badly miscast but struggle on dutifully with a leaden script. I got irritated by Prince Phillip's ill fitting blazer and sloping shoulders and Dominic West is nothing like Prince Charles. I remember these events as they occurred, the constant reporting of the Wales's marriage break up was boring then and even more boring now. We can't possibly know the ins and outs of other peoples marriages, nor do I want to. Not certain why so much of Ep 3 was about the early life of Mohammed Fayed. Interesting story in its own right but pretty irrelevant. I nodded off and Chariots of Fire was on so I assumed Netflix had switched itself off again. Imelda Staunton gets the Queens voice right but the words and phrases she uses don't sound right. The depicted conversations with John Major are ludicrous, The Queen could never have demanded a new yacht, how silly. That's not how it works. The Queen Mother is unrecognisable. Where was Sarah Ferguson btw? Perhaps she'll get her own spin off series. I only got to Ep6 so it might have got better but I couldn't manage anymore.",6
"all lies and fiction","This series is nothing more than garbage, lies, they romanticize a criminal and a lineage of murderers, they make them look good, when they are the opposite, they only show stupid things like she fell in love with a prince, poor king, dies,, oh how romantic, so sad, and nonsense of that type, through this type of fake series, they romanticize and make stupid people, entertain themselves and love these kind of people, but the crimes of this royal scum, they don't show that. That's how they brainwash people. And also they portrait churchill, who was a psychopath as if he had been good, However, the performances of claire foy and matt smith are splendid, theyre great actors, although it is all fiction, because the dark truth of all this royalty will never be shown. That embarrasses them.",1
"Excellent direction, very accurate as regards British aristocracy","I don't know if, eventually, this series ameliorate the impression we have of the Royal family. The good thing is that it does not present them as flawless people and it has a strong dose of objectivity in it. However, it has been unbearable to continue watching ever since Elisabeth's children grew up 'cause the whole ""ruthlesness"" and ""pusillanimity"" thing of this family can drive someone crazy. It reminds me of an old lady I worked for, that grew up in one of London's most rich aristocratic families. Her reaction to everything was as soulless and snobbish as Elisabeth's reaction towards Diana when the last one asked to talk to her. Cruel, ruthless, emotionless and useless 'human' beings that have nothing to give to the peuple, much less to themselves or to their relatives. And the worse thing about it is that it's not just in the movies, it's also true in real life.+ As if Diana was not good enough for Charles. He should have looked his face in the mirror first.I don't really know since when the problem with these ""Royal marbles"" started but it's definitely a close (thank god) circle of cold and frozen people that can do no good in this world but harm.This production though... extremely well directed. A good choice for spending your time.",8
"Meticulous recreation of royals' lives behind the scenes","""The Crown"" is beautifully made, with no expense spared on the design of the sets, locations and costumes. Skillful acting by all the main players, especially Matt Smith as Prince Philip, Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth, Vanessa Kirby as Princess Margaret, Jared Harris as King George VI and John Lithgow as Sir Winston Churchill. Also fine performances in some of the smaller roles, especially Greg Wise as Earl Mountbatten (and he looks just like him) and Jeremy Northam as Antony Eden. My only knocks: some glaring historical inaccuracies in the writing (which I found distracting), perhaps to pump up the tension or drama, and too many wink-wink suggestions of impropriety among the royals without any proof. One interesting element of ""The Crown"" is the exploration of the roles of various private secretaries to the royal family members, such as ""Tommy"" Lascelles and Martin Charteris. Very interesting series and well done.",8
"my opinion","I thank Netflix for this masterpiece. I hope to quickly download the fifth and sixth parts ... an integrated series, especially the fourth part. Perfect. 9.2/10",10
"A rare and wonderful sense of restraint hovering all over it.","Well it is quite smashingly executed, truly posh. I heard it cost a ton plus people are sore that their parents' and grandparents' low to middle class post-war misery was shrugged away by focusing on a king's lung cancer. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this one immensely. Great writing, excellent acting. The machinations of the English crown - white man's escapism par excellence.",8
"The Acting Change Doesn't Make Sense","I can see them changing actors as they jump ahead to the 80s but they brought these new actors in 1964. Only 1 year having passed. They also make their ages the focus of the plot. But what we're left with is historically inaccurate. Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret were in their mid 30s at the time. The struggles they felt as middle aged Royals never happened in the 60s and early 70s. None of it made sense.They also completely neutered Queen Elizabeth the 2nd. She had fire and a quiet confidence. As we all know she has in real life. She may be the most important Monarch who has ever lived. The new woman playing her is boring, uninteresting, bland, and dull. Also I love Gillian Anderson but what the hell was she doing playing Margaret Thatcher. She looked and sounded like Skeletor.",8
"Rumour has it","This wonderful production has outstanding performances. Especially Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip Who manages to totally inhabit the role. Olivia Coleman is a fine actor. Unfortunately, she plays the Queen as cold and lacking in humour. Her face Is permanently grumpy and emotionless. As usual the script is heavy with rumour and conjecture. If you can accept that, it's still well worth watching for the attention to detail and watching the drama of what was a very interesting period in history",8
"Season Four","The cast is just outstanding, led by Olivia Colman, as Elizabeth, Tobias Menzies, as Phillip, Josh O'Connor, as Charles, Helena Bonham Carter, as Margaret and Gillian Anderson, as Margaret Thatcher. Emma Corrin, as Diana, I think is less successful. I was surprised at how positively they portrayed Thatcher, as I was expecting a complete revisionist hack job, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I was also very surprised at the portrayal of Diana, whom they depict as a spoilt, narcissistic brat-Hear, Hear!
Excellent series. Great Season.",8
"Magnificent","I have currently watched the first 6 episodes having watched the first two series and the standard continues to be outstanding. It is visually stunning, add in the script and committed acting and the result can only be utter brilliance. Quite simply an epic production. Well done to Everyone involved. Now having watched the complete series every word above remains as said except I would make a special mention for the particularly brilliant portrayal of Prince Charles by Josh O'Connor. Did find the casting of Prince Phillip unconvincing though, but still gets a 10.",10
"Trying to make a good drama about boring people","This a very well produced show, with most of the times an amazing cast and performances.However, it has one major issue:
It is about boring people. Very very boring people. Because this is how these royals must be, human robots living under strict protocols. And their monotonous life cannot justify 50 (soon to be 60) 1 hour episodes of TV, no matter how well are made.Even if, very smartly, the creators of the show focused quite often in big personalities and major events that happened during Elizabeth's reign, I am afraid this is not enough to make The Crown interesting, simply cause these people are not interesting at all.On top of that, as the show's timeline started to reach the recent years, they started recycling the same things again and again, apparently cause they thought recent major events would not be as appealing to modern audience.But, how much can you keep watching the Queen not showing emotions or Charles whining about everything? Not much...
Even Diana could not save it. And Diana was probably the most interesting thing that happened to them.IMHO, this show should had lasted 2 seasons top, covering the whole Elizabeth period in no more than 20 episodes.Still, it has managed to offer us some great episodes, like ""Aberfan"", for this episode alone I gave a 6/10 rate to this show.",6
"Not As Good As You Might Think","If you're looking for an insight into the English royal family, then don't watch this dire docu-drama or whatever it is they call this type of show. It's really bad, with terrible acting and scripting. Not terrible actors - Colman, Bonham-Carter and Anderson are usually excellent, but this is like some cruel parody. I can only assume the English media don't want to upset the royals in their glowing crititques of this show.. It is complete caricature and I remember watching an English satirical show called Spitting Image and this seems largely based on that, but minus the humour. If this is the kind of thing the English get off on, then I will pass.
Gillian Anderson as Maggie Thatcher is shocking.",3
"Beautifully produced show.... but one odd issue","It would be very hard to find a show as perfectly crafted as this one: the production values are amazing, the sets stunning, the costumes wonderful, the direction sharp and intelligent, and the acting is superb (Gillian Anderson is incredible as the unpleasant Mrs. Thatcher, Claire Foy is equally outstanding, but so is everyone else -- with the exception of Helena Bonham-Carter, who for some reason often seems to be miscast, but here, as Margaret, she's particularly poor; she's much too fluffy to pull off the part).The only issue is (and perhaps this was the show's intention): all of the members of the royal family come across as unpleasant people. There doesn't seem to be a drop of humanity in any of them. The crown comes first to the degree that it debilitates everyone around it. The way the family treats Diana is spectacularly infuriating... but again, perhaps that's the point of the program, to show that the crown takes precedence over personality.All in all, however, fascinating to watch. If you ever dreamed about being royalty, this show will talk you out of any such ideas.The above was written after the first four seasons. The fifth season is not nearly as good as the previous ones. For one, the casting is weird. Elizabeth Debicki is an excellent actress but she's at least 6'3"", taller in heels, and towers ridiculously over everyone else, especially the poorly cast Imelda Staunton, who looks to be two feet shorter. And although this season is not that many years later than the previous, the characters are cast to look like they've aged two decades. Weird.",8
"Absolutely Stunning","This beautifully done show is really amazing. I'm an action an comedy type of person and this has minimal comedy and no action but still is so well acted that i'm pulled into it over and over. The scenes in this show are stunning and they follow up with amazing performances from all of the actors and actresses. I am sad that the queen changed in season three i really like Claire Foy and i dont mean that Olivia Coleman does a bad job she does very very well too but Claire Foy just really pulled you into the show the way she acts especially in this role was perfect really. I gave it a 9 stars only because i believe the end of season 2 was 1963 and she was still young and than bam season 3 its 1964 and she old that threw me off a bit. But other than that its an amazing show i would highly recommend watching it if your thinking hmm should i or should i not.",9
"In retrospect","When Season 6 first aired, it was almost universally (and immediately) trashed by viewers who said the events it portrayed bore no resemblance to what actually happened or was said. Several of these comments came from semi-insiders who claimed ""to know"".But ordinary complete outsiders like me will never know the truth, and the only reason I rated this series a 9 instead of 10 was that the production values, settings, and acting from literally everyone through all six seasons was so good that these variables all made the apparently sometimes-fictionalized story that much more convincing. How easy it would be to believe without doubt that Diana had answered Dodi as the series says she did?No point in elaborating more on the thousand reviews before mine. It was a brave, comprehensive and excellent series.",9
"It is simply amazing","The details in this masterpiece are to the point and proper spending of money to recreate the past has paid off very well.",10
"Absolutely Brilliant and Enlightening","There are those rarities among television series where occasionally one truly stands out. This is one of them. Historically revealing, touching, insightful...Yes, at times I found my way slipping away for a break when a chapter or two were not quite as engaging. But on a whole all the other chapters reveal more fascinating insights; such as the story of Prince Philip's mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg.One cannot be unimpressed by this series storytelling, superb production values, brilliant writing, direction, sets, costumes and above all else, superb casting and acting...An exceptionally talented cast and crew bring their absolute best A game to this fascinating and telling series.",10
"This series has proven my point","I've long since felt the monarchy is an antiquated institution that really has no place in modern society.
Passing down the crown from generation to generation seems to be the only goal. There no real social work being done, just tours and photo ops.
The ones in the royal family who truly try to make a change in the world are never uplifted, rather they are torn apart.
This series should open many people's eyes to a broken system that never learns from its mistakes.
A system where education or a sense of what is needed from government isn't a prerequisite to power.
This isn't just entertainment, it's a peek into the world that the real world wasn't supposed to see.
It's very well done, my only complaint as a viewer is they foibled a few timeline items and I despise the changing of actors despite the fact that they are all wonderful actors.",9
"The Plane Landed","Absolutely loved the first two seasons. Claire Foy is astonishing. The entire cast is awesome. Script and production values off the scale.Season 3-4? It's like the plane landed and the passengers forgot to get off.Really makes me sad and even a little mad since the first two seasons were SO GREAT!",8
"So good","I put off watching this for a long time because I thought it might be drab and boring. Not at all. So well done. Fantastic cinematography and acting.",8
"Wish they wouldn't have changed the cast","Wish they wouldn't have changed the cast for season 3. Loved season one and two but stopped watching after a couple episodes of season 3. They should have kept the same actors and used makeup instead of a whole new cast to age the characters. Netflix ruined the continuity between seasons. No one can replace Claire Foy and Matt Smith.",7
"Season 3 is a flop","The season only has 2 good episodes.Claire Foy MUST come back as well as Vanesa Kirby.
Colman does not hit the mark. Helena is a disaster.
Two years wasted.Bring her back!",3
"A Multi-Million Dollar Finest Historical Drama.","They are the most famous people in the world and yet very little is known about them- the British monarchy. There is so much more to them then what meets the eye. 'The Crown' describes the chronicles of 'Queen Elizabeth II' and provides a sneak peak into her personal life right from her marriage to prince Philip and her unexpectedly early coronation as the queen after the sudden demise of her father- King George VI.
At a tender age, her young shoulders were burdened with the massive responsibility of the crown and as decades pass she evolves from this naïve young lady to a strong women revered across the world. She faces constant conflict between her duty to the crown and her role as a wife, daughter, sister and a mother. Huge sacrifices are made to preserve the integrity of the crown. Perpetually under public scrutiny they hardly enjoy any privacy.
Everything the royals say or do becomes a matter of public discussions and sometimes their actions are followed by a huge impact to the public. Pretty stringent, conservative rules are set and they are expected to behave in a certain way and hence they are surrounded by brilliant and experienced men who provide advises regarding what to say, eat, wear or even marry! As years pass, the queen faces major historical crisis affecting the world, engages in world politics while simultaneously coping with a number of personal crisis too.
Claire Foy who plays the queen is absolutely brilliant and beauty to watch. Olivia Coleman succeeds her in season 3 fits seamlessly into the character and was an absolute delight as the queen! I Loved Matt Smith as the charming prince Philip. The 100 million production budget is seen in the lavish sets and costumes of the show.",9
"Magnificent!","All of theese beautiful and talented actresses playing the Queen (Claire Foy, Olivia Coleman and Imelda Staunton) all make the perfect Elisabeth. This must have taken a lot og time and practice to achieve. I am in awe of you all. Not to mention the settings,all other actors and actressess,the likeliness of real people. The storyline, the music and the costumes. I have never before understood the point of Netflix's double thumbs up for rating,however I do now. This is a much to watch! I loved every single episode,and I will peobably watch any future series from the same makers. Very well done!!",8
"Loved it","Some series has been better than others but on the whole a fantastic series. Ive always admired the queen , always felt for Charles but the last series really brings some sad and poignant moments.You still have to take in account it's mostly fiction based on real events..who knows what private conversations went on between closed doors but they have done a fab job.i only have two criticisms...they portrayed the Queen as quite a solom character and by all accounts she wasn't and what they did with prince Harry in the last series I don't know. It's like they went out to make him as un likeable as possible. Apart from the red hair he was the total opposite ...not right at all.It was nice how they showed the bond with the queen and Margaret...even though Margaret by all accounts was a huge snob and generally not a very nice person, they obviously cared very much for each other and they portrayed her very well.I wouldn't want to be in the queens shoes..choosing crown and tradition over love and family..huge respect for her. Sad day when she died.",9
"Brilliant Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher!!!!","I cannot stop watching Gillian Anderson in the role Margaret Thatcher!
Brilliant acting!!! All gestures and the spirit of The Iron Lady are there!!
Amazing Gillian!",10
"Difficult to rate the best actor","Every season has been fabulous. The Acting was superb. Although real life royals can be 'perfectly out of touch toffs' the cast have studied them well. The series has certainly explained their extraordinary lives very wellReally clever acting. Beautiful shots of Buckingham palace, Balmoral and other locations. Prince Philip comes out as a firm favourite as his character is bought to life each season by 3 perfect actorsNo spoilers here. Definitely worth watching if only to understand 'the firm'. This piece of history may never be captured again in the same way and forms part of British history.",10
"Exemplary tv","An amazing show in all regards; the casting, the acting, the cinematography, and the storylines. It's just all absolutely sensational.",10
"Powerful","Powerful compelling well casted and supremely acted.... another fantastic success",10
"Great Historical Fiction","Acting is superbGreat castingStellar set and costume designOverall really well done",10
"Great first 2 seasons! Weird switch of actors in Season 3","As many noted the switch from Foy to Colman as well as most other actors was just poorly implemented.In Season 3, the first episode begins in year 1964. Queen Elizabeth was born in 1926 so at this point she would be 38. Not to criticize Olivia Colman but she absolutely looked nothing like 38. I believe she was 44 when this was filmed (??). But she plays a much better 50+ Queen Elizabeth than 38, 39, etc.There is no practical reasoning in this age that all actors had to be whole sale swapped out for a season. I would much rather had Olivia Colman come in to replace Foy when it was 1970s being depicted.While watching this fine show, everyone we watched with was stunned that a 38 year old Queen Elizabeth would be made to look like she did in that show and it detracted from the otherwise enjoyable cinematography.",7
"Change of the cast","Ruined it for me. I dont like new actors, they could have just aged with make up, why did You needed to change the cast?? Horrible",5
"Exceptional Show","Just exceeds most shows on TV/Cable/Streaming today by its exceptional cast and accurate time pieces. Just a real pleasure to see these amazing actors bring current and past characters/people to life.",10
"Long Live The Crown","If you are looking for a fantastic historical drama about what it means to be a (British) royal, look no further than The Crown. But be warned: if you are looking for a series that gushes over the royal family, I implore you to look elsewhere, for this is not that show. Whilst being a royal looks glamorous on the outside, it is quite a different story behind the glitz. I will just say this: prior to watching The Crown, I was a supporter of the British monarchy; now, not so much.Like any family, the British royals have weathered trials and tribulations, which is exactly what is at the heart of The Crown. The actors perform the stories stunningly, as do the sets, costumes, etc. Her Majesty herself, Claire Foy, embodies the role perfectly, though is a bit subdued compared to most of the other characters. Jared Harris is a joy to watch as King George VI. The real star of the show, however, is Matt Smith. He steals every scene he appears in and breathes life into an otherwise (but understandably) stuffy show.The Crown would get 10 stars from me if not for two things: the first being that finale isn't as climactic and interesting as previous episodes; the second is the casting of Winston Churchill. John Lithgow puts in fine work here and a good accent to boot, but that does not negate the fact that he is an American and Churchill was most certainly NOT. Being as unnecessary as it is, this casting choice borders on unforgivable.At the heart of The Crown is fascinating insight into what Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family were like as people behind closed doors (50+ years ago); it doesn't take long to realize that these people, despite their titles and lifestyles, are as human as any of us.",9
"Overall excellent, but Season 5/6 casting of Prince Charles is as bad as it gets","Enough has been said about how good the show is.But the casting of the role of Prince Charles, in the final two seasons, is among the worst combinations of both terrible choice in actor and the actor himself.He doesn't resemble the actual person in the slightest. Worse, though, is his awful acting and repeated affectations, which are as amateurish and annoying as anything I've seen in a big budget show like this. It's nearly unwatchable to a point. The over-and-over biting of his lower lip, while sliding his lower jaw to the side, is as dumb a crutch as you'll see. It's so obvious you can even see that the editor tries to bail him out with quick cuts before he can complete the move, in some scenes. He's dreadful and it derails the show at too many moments over the final series of episodes.How they got this so wrong, while getting so much of the casting (and acting, in turn) right, it's hard to conceive an explanation. But it's a pity, because the writing and the production of the show, along with most of the really great performances of the other actors, makes it otherwise a must-watch.Both ladies who played Diana were really great... it would have been so easy to get it wrong, but in each case, I thought they were both fantastic in their acting, and were edited/directed in such a way to really evoke the real princess. Ditto for the eldest William, by the way, who is holding his own, equally.(one other exception: the role of Dodi Fayed... while the actor was great, I feel it was really miscast as well, and plays to an overly sympathetic image, which doesn't really fit with what I think most would recall.)",8
"the only problem the changing characters","Everything is just wonderfully brought up to the screen for the tv series, there are some issues since my point of view about some of the actors chosen for the rolls, huge mistake, big big Big one could be to change the actress who personified Diana for anyone else than Emma Corrin, I would re film the chapters already done by now, Emma it's amazingly alike the real Diana, nobody else could possibly personified her better, plus Diana sadly didn't have much time to get old sadly, so why not only adjust her a bit?, my opinion though.",10
"Season 3 though 😔","I loved Seasons 1 & 2, and I rated it 10. But Season 3 storyline is not at all appealing. It borders boredom at times. Waiting for Season 4 and Princess D.",10
"The Crown (2016-)","For those who eat this stuff up with a spoon, 'The Crown' is everything we could have wanted. Addictive and tantalizing. Powerful performances and lavish cinematography make The Crown a top-notch production worthy of its grand subject.Season 1Beginning with her 1947 wedding, this epic drama charts the life of Queen Elizabeth II, who becomes leader of the world's most famous monarchy at the tender age of 25 -- commencing a reign that will last more than six decades.The first season of 'The Crown' features brilliant performances from Claire Foy,(Claire won a Golden Globe for her role as Queen Elizabeth II ) John Lithgow and the rest of the cast, and is an immersive experience into the fascinating world of English royalty. Should you watch it: Indubitably yes ! 10/10Season 2Britain's royal family finds itself deeply affected by the turbulent times of the late 1950s and early 1960s as young Queen Elizabeth confronts a daunting series of events, from the Suez Canal crisis to the scandalous Profumo affair.The Crown continues its reign with a self-assured sophomore season that indulges in high drama and sumptuous costumes.Claire Foy, Vanessa Kirby and Matt Smith continue to dazzle audiences with their ability to embody their real life counterparts. Claire Foy is excellent again as queen Elizabeth II. The duke of Edinburgh is more present in this season, this is not bad, but it takes away from Claire Foy; who is the stand out of the first two seasons. The filming, the decors, the sounds, the music, the photography are still outstanding . 7/10Season 3After the mostly unwavering season 1 and 2, the show-runner Peter Morgan famously recast actors Claire Foy and Matt Smith and other cast members of the show. As the entire cast changed over to reflect the ageing of the characters as they moved into a different period in history. I was skeptical about this decision but the new cast knocked it out of the park .
Olivia Colman Queen Elizabeth II, Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret,Charles Dance
Lord Mountbatten aka (Tywin Lannister in HBO's Game of Thrones (2011-2015)) ,Tobias Menzies ( Outlander) Prince Phillip,Erin Doherty Princess Anne ,Josh O'Connor Prince CharlesSeason Three covers the time period between 1964 and 1977 beginning with Harold Wilson's election as the Queen's first Labour prime minister and ending with the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. It follows pivotal moments such as the death and state funeral of Winston Churchill, the Aberfan disaster, the Apollo 11 moon landing, and the Investiture of Prince Charles as the Prince of Wales.The Crown looks quite different from its predecessors. Despite all the changes, the Netflix series not lost any of its quality. And in most regards builds upon it. In this season, it continues to operate at a very high level and offers even deeper insights into the lives and minds of the royals. Olivia Colman shines, but as The Crown marches on in reliably luxurious fashion through time it finds space for the characters around her, providing ample opportunity for the appealing ensemble to gleam, too. 9/10Season 4Olivia Colman stars as Elizabeth, with main cast members Tobias Menzies, Helena Bonham Carter, Josh O'Connor, Marion Bailey, Erin Doherty and Emerald Fennell all reprising their roles from the third season. Gillian Anderson, Emma Corrin and Stephen Boxer are added to the main cast. Additionally, Charles Dance returns in the season's first episode and Claire Foy reprises her role as Elizabeth in a cameo flashback scene.The fourth season covers the time period between 1979 and 1990, is set during Margaret Thatcher's premiership, and introduces Lady Diana Spencer. Events depicted include the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, their 1983 tour of Australia and New Zealand, the Falklands War, Michael Fagan's break-in at Buckingham Palace,Lord Mountbatten's funeral,the Princess of Wales's appearance at the Barnardo's Champion Children Awards, and Thatcher's departure from office.Golden Globe 2021Netflix original took home the trophy for Best Drama Series. The Crown is now a two-time winner in the category, previously being honored in 2017 for season 1.Josh O'Connor and Emma Corrin, were named the Best Performance by an Actor in a Drama Series and Best Performance by an Actress in a Drama Series.The Crown love continued later in the show with Gillian Anderson winning Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Margaret Thatcher.Whatever historical liberties The Crown takes in its fourth season are easily forgiven thanks to the sheer power of its performances , particularly Gillian Anderson's imposing take on The Iron Lady and newcomer Emma Corrin's embodiment of a young Princess Diana. 10/10",10
"Emma Corrin steals the show","A short while ago, I finished ""Pennyworth"" and remarked that Emma Corrin (Esme Winikus) had a mystical beauty about her that was hard to describe. At the time, I didn't know she would be cast as another woman with the same rare and equal beauty: Princess Diana in ""The Crown."" Having watched Princess Diana's life blossom and falter (she and Charles were married on my birthday), I freely admit to feeling the impact Diana had on people, and reliving it as I watched Emma Corrin's uncanny portrayal. A week into the introduction of season 4, reviews are surfacing concerning the historical accuracy of the show, what the royal family thinks, etc. Find fault if you must, but reserve it to the script. Or, simply take it as ""Based on real events"" fiction and enjoy the actors and their similarity to their real world counterparts.",8
"Epic series with depth however Prince Phillip biasedly portrayed","I was drawn into the series immediately. Although, I felt Peter Morgan might have dictated his Jewish heritage toward Prince Philip unflatteringly.First, Matt Smith might not have the right look as Prince Philip in real live. He is less handsome with somehow odd facile features and wrong hair color in nature. I only watched the first two episodes and he was already bottom naked several times. Which I would not think it depicted Queen's husband in the dignified fashion. Mr. Morgan's reason might be Prince Philip's background implying himself as a Nazi's sympathizer. Recently, I watched ""Edward VIII: The Nazi King"" which told the Nazi Sympathizer history of Duke and Duchess Windsor. So I would only assume further episodes ever containing abdicated King Edwards might suffer the similar fates.The plots and scripts were gripping and enticing. Settings and scenes were grand and meticulous. Peter Morgan is not the first person took the liberty to steer the story toward his likeness or unlikeness. However, the show could be better without such obvious biases. Objectivity should be followed when it is required.Nevertheless, as the chronological events unfolding Queen Elizabeth demonstrating her great strength to ride out personal and political storms was remarkably admirable. To be a leader who cannot directly influence politics requires great deal of self-restraining. We can all knowledge that this program very well depicted on that. After finishing first 2 seasons , I couldn't wait for the 3rd .",8
"Season by season, it disintegrates","I absolutely loved Seasons 1 & 2. Perfect actors. Interesting plots, character development, and dynamics. I couldn't get enough. Season 3 was excellent, but I have to say that Season 4 has been a real disappointment. It was stressful to watch and seems kind of awkward. The acting is okay but not fantastic like it was. Characters seem very 2 dimensional and, frankly, they are rather boring. I guess you can't expect something that starts this amazing to stay this amazing.",6
"Series 5 review only","Sadly on a downhill slide the previous series were very good but this one not so good. Most characters were miscast - the acting was good but casting was not. The stories seem to have become very low key and trivial compared to previous series.Seems like the writers are promoting Charles these days, overall he seemed to come out of things, if not sqeeky clean, at least as progressive and misunderstood. Conversely Diana becomes a mad unstable hoyden. The queen is miscast as are the queen mother and Philip all do not give much credence to their roles.Very 'ho hum' over all, and presumable we await series 6 which will more than likely the last series for anything significant to happen. Hopefully the casting and writing will improve.",5
"Yes I am aware that divorce is complicated (S5 feedback solely)","The Crown is one of my most beloved shows, I'd generally give it a 10/10. Season 5, on the other hand, is 3/10 at best
There really is not much to say as to the season itself, I see everyone here has already pointed out the pure dissonance of this season and the soap opera-dramatization of it all.All I want to add is that the question of divorce and general Diana/Charles relationship was ridiculous in nature and treated its viewer like a genuine child. I think the most hated plot for me was in Episode 9, which primarily consisted out of numerous couples explaining in child-like terms WHY people might fall out of love. I felt like someone was hitting me in the head with a sledge hammer of:
yes you see while you may hate Charles he is still a person and marriage is complicated
yes you see monarchy is a heavy business
yes you see both were unhappyThis is the type of rhetoric only a child might not be aware of. And then there is this huge scene at the end of the episode where it feels like a fanfic summary of key events between the two. No human in this world would talk this way, no couple could behave this way. AND it was suppose to be a final scene of goodbye between the two.It felt like a was getting lectured at every turn and each character of the show had at least one moment of painful attempt in trying to justify Charles and explain that ACTUALLY he is just a human after all.WHILE at the same time giving little to no context WHY Diana would be upset, why would she be paranoid, fearful, and anxious. A particularly upsetting moment was a complete disregard to the intelligence Diana had as to mental health issues of this world. I thought that in shooting the material for her interview, they would at least put in some of the mentions in explaining what mental struggles are, yet it was completely disregarded. It was used as a skewed path to villainize her character.Its funny, because in the show she herself points out that people tend to demonize her due to her poor mental state. Yet the show does the exact same thing. It removes context, removes factors that contributed to Diana being in that emotional state, and instead paints her as a vindictive, shallow person whose sole priority is to destroy Charles, the monarchy, and possibly herself.The show attempts to humanize the failed marriage between the two, yet it creates an unstable balance of painting Diana as a villain, while completely removing responsibility from Charles.A frustrating experience. What a shame, with such high expectations of visualizing events leading to one of key tragedies of UK history.",8
"Masterpiece","Claire Foy was perfect for the role of the young queen.
Like many here, I found it a little jarring to get used to a whole new cast in Season 3.
However, I persisted and am glad I did.
The new cast reflect the fact that the characters had indeed aged.
It would have been slightly ridiculous to slap ""ageing"" make-up on the younger crew.
Olivia Coleman brilliantly captures the middle-aged monarch.
And Season 3 covers a lot of notable history, like the Aberfan tragedy.
As for Helena Bonham Carter, I think her wild, quirky nature brilliantly encapsulates the older and wilder Margaret. See her party scene with Lyndon Johnson!",10
"Just the best series","Fantastic series in every way, great characters and you get more curious of historic events and learn a lot.",10
"Season 4","I love The Crown and was really excited for season 4. Gillian Anderson as Thatcher and Emma Corrin as Diana are excellent additions to the cast and it seems the cast are more settled than season 3. That excitement has somewhat subsided and the reality is the season is rushed. 11 years compacted down to 10 episodes and really interesting plots are ignored, Lord Mountbatten death happens but is then somewhat ignored as is the troubles with the IRA. We have to remember that the private lives of the royal family and Thatcher aren't publicly known and some liberty has to be taken with storytelling, as it has been done with other seasons.The plotlines with Prince Andrew are really cleverly written and he comes across as ignorant and narcissistic as we expected.The show is about the Crown and the Sovereign, but Olivia Colman is somewhat supporting cast along with Helena Bonham Carter and Tobias Menzies. Helena Bonham Carter shines in her stand alone episode but blink and you miss her in the rest of the season.The nitty gritty is that this season is Charles & Diana heavy, almost too heavy, to the point that you see the rushed plotlines and other stories were expendable for the story of Charles & Diana. Plenty creative liberty has been taken and it could be seen as an attempt at character assassination of Charles & Camilla. The balance that is mainly missed is that Diana wasn't exactly an angel but that is played down considerably. I thought that the writers were deliberate in their bad Charles characterisation. But, reading the upset that the Palace and friends of Charles in the papers in response to the crown makes me believe that there is a lot of truth in what happened, but written somewhat differently to what really happened (creative licence).Overall I expected much better that what was offered and left somewhat disappointed. Quite sad to see this cast go and it's a shame that the writers didn't give them a better send off.",8
"Immaculately produced and acted, and plodding yet sympathetic","I'm about halfway through season 5 of the Crown so far, and though it is not finished, I thought I might give my thoughts on it.First, the production is just unbelievable. I am not sure how or where they shoot it, but they do an amazing job (from an outsider perspective) of capturing the environment. The set design, clothing, props, etc. Are all top-notch, throughout the entire series.Second, the acting is superb on all fronts. One can argue about how well various actors 'look' like the people they are portraying, but the acting is stellar all around. For those complaining about some of the later seasons as miscast, I'd point you to John Lithgow as Churchill from season 1. His acting is amazing, but I can't help but see him as Dick Solomon. So, this is something the show always has to deal with to some extent.My biggest gripe with the show is that the fundamental theme never seems to achieve much evolution. It portrays the royals as a pampered class, yet trapped in their roles by the expectations of the state and the ever-present threat of scandal. In season 1, this is both uncomfortable and entertaining when it is at the apparent whim of Pip Torrens' excellent Tommy Lascelles. By season 5.... it feels a bit stale. Admittedly, this is probably not the show's fault. If any of what is portrayed is true, then it makes sense that the struggle to be human is a central theme of what it is to be royal.So, this isn't a theme that can really be resolved, barring the monarchy being done away with. As a biopic, I think it works. But, it makes for viewing that can be a bit frustrating. I guess that when you are constrained by a history that is still present, there is no easy way around that.Probably the show's greatest success here is that it can make the plight of the royals sympathetic, even though their very existence is, especially now, nothing more than an elaborate dog and pony show. It would be interesting if they ever reflected on how religion is a scam, and therefore monarchy (ordained by god) an even bigger one. Do they always believe their own BS? I guess they have to.",8
"Absolutely Beautiful","The crown have not only introduced me to the royal family but have also gave me deep and profound respect for not just the royal family but the monarchy and the Queen. Watching this series has been astonishing. To see the side of the royal family most valuable and valued parts is amazing. This series has everything that is need not just for an historical story but a story of a woman who made the job an absolute necessity for herself. Being able to see the young Queen, middle aged Queen, and older Queen experiencing all the things that has made her who she was is a privilege. There is nothing more that can be asked of than this show. Queen Elizabeth will always have my most and profound respect and love.",10
"ART","I am a huge fan of historical and true stories drama, so it was too easy to get engaged with the show. It covers the queen's ascension to the throne, personal events within the royal family, and world events during her reign. Each episode covers an historic event with some link to the royal family's personal events. The writers were very clever spinning and engaging the personal with the public in each episode, specially that each one could be a stand-alone. What makes the show more engaging is that the royal family are not necessarily the focal point of every episode. They're more a medium through we witness British and world history.All the elements of the series are very well crafter. It's pace is relatively slow, however, the immersion in the impecable dialogue and script cancels any sense of boredom. It is visually appealing and the photography, locations, and costume design are top-notch.The writing is something else, it conveys a lot of thought and philosophy, with a subtle tension in storytelling in each episode without triggering any anxiety. The characters have more than one layer, and the love-hate relationships between the royals is very real and genuine.Regarding ""Claire Foy"", I will borrow an expression from another review: ""She is dignity and class personified"".On a totally different note, this series is so beautiful to the extent that you find your self bonding with suprematist colonial imperialists, and it makes the most useless family on earth seem important and interesting. But most importantly, it makes you guilt-free admire monsters like Churchill and Thatcher, this is how good this show is.",9
"Last season missing something","I really enjoyed seasons one and two he most due to the casting of Claire Foy. I being the series set deepest in history it was easy to suspend belief as it's quite apparent much of the narrative can't possibly true. Yes the real life public events are likely recreated well but nobody knows what went on behind the closed palace doors. The middle era - aka Olivia Coleman - was the least effective for me. I love Olivia but I just couldn't see believe her as the Queen. The final era was better for the casting of Imelda but then it was also the hardest to believe, it felt like I was watching a live action tabloid with Charles and Di. I know they had a challenge portraying Di's accident but it's done so sparingly, hence my description of it missing something. Bravo to the cinematography throughout.",9
"Season 3 is much better than Season 4","I made good efforts to continue watching the episodes of the current season, despite the convincing performances of the actors and actresses.
With some criticisms. Gillian Anderson made a enphisema talking Thatcher and Josh O'Connor usually with a inclining head, as if he was holding a 25 kg over his head.
Season 3 was definitely much better than Season 4.
Season 4 is flat, boring sometimes.
Season 5 seems to be promising with Jonathan Pryce as Philip, Lesley Manville as Princess Margaret and Imelda Stanton as Elizabeth.
And I am still missing Vanessa Kirby and Pip Torrens of Seasons 1 and 2.",6
"Olivia Colman","Following Claire Foy is showing how bad this woman is to play the Queen. She comes off unlikable and dour. I may not finish this season. And what's with the brown eyes?",4
"Great series","While historically it follows events....it certainly has to fill in many blanks as far as the private conversations of the family goes. And in typical ""Hollywood"" style...it likely embellishes much of it for dramatic purposes. Otherwise it might be too boring to keep attention (granted, the royal family always seems t9 have drama). I do wonder if Princess Anne was as horribly wretched as she is portrayed. And the Margaret Thatcher characterization is truly awful....and not an unusual portrayal of her by Hollywood as aloof. Those that were close to her would not agree on her representation as so stiff and awkward. The actress almost looked like her whole face had been botoxed. Terrible. But this is all minor.....an extremely well done series.",8
"It's good to finally watch it","Let's note that i was not at all familiar with the royal british family. Thus, watching a show about it didn't seem rather interesting and intriguing for me. It was a pity that I wait for so long. Great scenery, costumes and the whole production is a state of art. The fascinating part is that you learn many things about historical facts of the royal family but of the whole world too. It takes a 9 from me due to some not great acting I encountered through the whole 4 seasons.
Really eager to see the other 2 seasons. Keep up the good job guyssss!",9
"Hard to find a flaw.","It's rare for me to give a perfect score, but the performances are superb, the look is so pristine, and the overall storylines are captivating! Well done by all involved!",10
"Review of First Season's DVD","Wonderful series covering the life of the young sovereign, HM Queen Elizabeth II. This season covers her life from the day before her wedding (Nov 1947) until late in 1956 just after Princess Margaret breaks off her long-term relationship (it happened over 60 years ago, so don't call it a spoiler). The series is very interesting, but can be slow at parts too. Uncover little known or unseen historical events like the operation on King George VI right in the palace (scene was performed by an actual surgical staff recreating the operating techniques of the time), Sir Winston Churchill's fight with one of his portrait artists (an excellent episode that won John Lithgow an Emmy), or the 1952 Great Smog of London that resulted in the deaths of over 10,000 people. This series is certainly worth investing the 10 hours needed to watch the entire season. The only disappointing feature of this DVD release is the almost total lack of special features (big deal - a photo gallery) on this 4-disc set.",10
"A magnificent series","I have just watched the first 3 seasons in the past 2 weeks. What an amazing creation. There is a certain likeability in the first 2 series of the Queen. As she grows older & is played by a different actress in series 3, she seems more cold & remote but possibly more in her role too. The Royalty are a strange mob & the series shows this so well with brilliant music that brings you in to the emotions of different events. There is a brilliance in the story telling with episodes being not just about the family, but significant historic events. The coal mine disaster in Wales shows so well an early example which became the issue with Diana, about the coldness of the Royalty & their belief that their role was to be that way. You see the interactions of the Queen with Charles & see such harshness, same with the sending of Charles to a savage school in Scotland by his taskmaster father, but the exploration of his fathers life shows why he acted as he did. There are so many fascinating aspects to the Royalty, how they are evolving as society evolves, their efforts to modernise & become more human. Their out of touch disconnection of excessive wealth relative to most of humanity remains, and I wonder if this will be better examined in the series that have yet to be produced & aired. There is much to learn from this series & it really is an emotional rollercoaster as it becomes so easy to relate to different people in the stories. There has been some free rein in some stories steering away from known facts which is a pity & unnecessary as there is plenty of story in the Royals to make such an action unnecessary.",9
"Season 5: The eternal wait","SummaryA season one step below the fourth, with less domestic and international politics and more emphasis on family dynamics (which is also a matter of State), with the relationship between Prince Charles and Lady Diana taking center stage and a growing rivalry between the Prince of Wales and his mother (where the personal and the political are mixed) and what this means from today for an heir who had to wait another 30 years to access the throne.ReviewThe fifth season of The Crown covers part of the 90s and has had to renew the staff of its cast, with the blow that this entails in some cases.Undoubtedly, the recent death of Elizabeth II gives renewed interest to the series, which reveals that the internships between the queen and the heir Charles were already long-standing and that the wait for the Prince of Wales to access the throne should be prolonged no less. Than 30 more years. The mixture between the personal and the political in that conflict is developed in a very successful way.The season is more focused on family dynamics, with the rivalry between Carlos and his mother (with an heir apparently interested in renewing the monarchy) and with several chapters dedicated to the crisis and dissolution of the prince's marriage to Lady Diana Spencer. There is less politics and less international politics - perhaps as a reflection of the declining importance of the United Kingdom on the world stage - and a more visible presence of the press and its operations around the royal family. One chapter (perhaps the most flowery) takes an unexpected leap back in time recounting a historical event with unexpected consequences in the present of the action.As for the cast, the great Olivia Colman must give up the position to an Imelda Staunton who makes up an almost seventy-year-old queen firmly clinging to the throne and her privileges and those of the royal family and to continue managing the married and emotional life of her sons and daughters. As a matter of State, although sometimes she resembles a kind granny; on more than one occasion she affirms that the crown is a ""lifetime commitment"". Dominic West assumes a Prince Charles with concerns and ambitions and on a permanent waiting list; this time Princess Margaret falls on an exquisite Lesley Manville (who stars in one of the best chapters), Jonathan Pryce is a Prince Philip who is active in making some political decisions (the dynamics of the royal couple are always interesting and revealing) and Olivia Williams assumes the role of Camila Parker Bowles, the eternal lover of the crown prince. It is worth noting the very good composition that Elizabeth Debicki makes of a seductive, resolute and melancholic Lady Di, whose role as a relegated wife in the series The Night Manager was surely taken into account for her election. This part of the reign of Elizabeth II corresponds to the term of the Conservative John Major (Jonny Lee Miller) as Prime Minister.In short, a season perhaps one step below Season 4, although with its usual acting excellence, tight dialogues, the expected private and official interviews where the queen exercises her power and the well-known production display. Put to choose between the chapters of this season, I prefer the Manville (Annus Horribilis), the titled Gunpowder and the last one.",9
"Season 4 is better than ever!","If you didn't hate Charles before this, you certainly will now! Addictive and mesmerizing show, just gets better and better!!",8
"It's been quite a ride","I've been a fan of the crown since day one it's only now when it's all over that I realize I've never wrote anything about a show so dear to my heart!!I remember when I first started, it was out of pure curiosity for the royal family and mostly because I dig into anything historical really but the way they sum up 50 years of history of a family, an institution so beautifully done I got to admit it became, over the years, something more than just curiosity.One of the rare beauty of the show would be in the realization that it's not suppose to be that interesting since we already know everything that's gonna happen I mean there's nothing really different since it's semi-historical there's no real room for big artistic change but that's precisely where the beauty lies because of the way they put everything together from the cast, the production design, the accuracy of it all makes it interesting and almost like the best history class in ""history"" plus we've never really had one piece of art that has everything of the royal family for 50 years...we've had books, documentary, movies it's always a piece of the puzzle so to put it all together like they did was obviously gonna be a success story!!And let's talk about the elephant in the room which is not only a perfect and rich choice of cast but it's how perfect it is each 2 seasons, we don't really have that out there maybe for some movies but never that way...and it's crazy how it's only possible for that specific story...at first I got to admit it was a bit strange but the actors are so good, maybe good is an understatement, that you immediately feel comfortable and less lost as they started to play along....My favorite season of them all is the 4th season I'd say it's 3rd and 4th. 3rd would be because of Olivia Colman as Queen and Josh O'Connor as Prince Charles but it's definitely 4th with Emma Corrin as the perfect young Diana and Gillian Anderson as the wonderful iron fist lady Margaret I mean season 4 was something of another realm really and Gillian totally killed it as Prime minister, but for season 5 and 6 I thought I had seen it all but Elisabeth Debicki gave that graceful, elegant Diana I didn't even know was possible after Emma or even Diana herself. I mean the transition of the characters over the year with different actor I think is the most relevant element of the show...and of course our 3 Queens were flawless I can't really say which one was my favorite as they each represented so perfectly a different stage of that wonderful character but because maybe of me or let's say our generation is used to an older Elisabeth I'd say Imelda was my favorite but really they all did way more than a wonderful unforgettable job.Most memorable characters best played over the 6 season by order of preference would be: Princess Diana, Margaret Thatcher, Queen Elisabeth, Princess Margaret and Prince Charles, that's totally personal and subjective I think those were really well played and left a mark over the year but everyone was really great!The script, the production and costume design of the show was something else. There not enough word to express how good of a job that whole journey was I can't think of a single flaw they could have it's really a love letter the royal family to our beloved and imperfect Queen, may she rest in piece!!",8
"If only...","Casting Olivia Coleman and Helen Botnam-Carter were mistakes. They are too old for their parts. Where Foy brought that quality of the Queen's personality through with just a look, Coleman looks as if she's confused all the time. Still enjoy the series but it's too bad the Coleman and Carter are being compared constantly.",7
"Season 4 is missing too many historical moments","I was very disappointed to find that nothing of Charles and Diana's wedding was included. According to what I read the wardrobe designers went to all the trouble of recreating her dress down to the actual buttons, but then not to have included that historic moment in the show! While it doesn't need to be a drawn out moment in the film it should have been included. There are many people watching who weren't alive at this time and if it is truly about the Crown important historical moments should not be neglected. That also includes the kidnapping attack on Princess Anne. None of this should be left out as it is what make the Crown and is relevant.",4
"Artistic masterpiece","The crown is one of the best show produced by Netflix if not the best . Acting by Claire foy as queen in first two seasons is just brilliant. And also Queen Elizabeth II's character was more likable in first two seasons. Coming to 3rd and 4th seasons I missed Claire foy very badly make no mistake Olivia Colman is a terrific actress but Claire Foy set benchmark high and Olivia failed miserably. And also with change of cast ,writers changed queen character as well from being kind and generous to cold and self oriented. I enjoyed all four seasons. I would recommend you to watch this artistic masterpiece.",8
"Great series","The Crown has been a great series since the beginning. It is sad to read so much ageism coming from reviewers.",10
"Wow","A very interesting show with majority of it historically accurate. I thought the switch of cast every 2 seasons would annoy me but every actor has been fantastic!!! Each season builds on the last and of course the Diana story is amazing, the 2 queens have been fantastic.",8
"Just Amazing, great casting, amazing writing","This show will not disappoint. It has romance, drama, intrigue, and the most AMAZING CAST!!! The writing is superb, and there is nothing disappointing about the show. A must watch for sure!!!",10
"Hooked!","I had very little interest in the royal family, but this series is a masterpiece! The production value is stunning. One feels as if they've stepped back in time, and are are along for the ride, a fly on the wall during the Queen's long and winding reign. Highly recommended.",10
"Absolutely Fantastic","It's quite refreshing to see the new cast settle in to a new era of the Monarch. Not to say the old cast isn't missed, Olivia Colman and Helena Bonham Carter have truly made their mark on the show as well and are just as part of the story. Mostly, when there is change, people don't accept it. But I was quite surprised by the change. I like that they kept the same pace of the story, and made a very good transition to an older, more experienced Queen. I am a big fan of the entire show in general ; the acting is superb, the story-telling is interesting and it seems to be getting better with each episode. Not to mention the undeniable resemblance to the real-life people they are portraying. I watched all seasons in more or less 3 weeks, and was absoulety invested.",10
"Season 3: Had to stop watching","Seasons 1 and 2 were incredible. Season 3 felt like a totally different series. All different actors, all absolute strangers, leaving me with no further interest in their stories. So, bye bye. (What on earth were they ever thinking to do such a thing!)",8
"Great series","Great series. Only wish they kept original actors and aged them. They outperformed their replacements.",9
"Season 5 Interesting","Wow! A lot of complaints about this season. Not sure what you were expecting, but hey folks, it's a TV show, with a lot of embellishment thrown into the facts of the time. That's pretty much the definition of drama.I Thought it was good, and had a lot of interesting insights into the characters, whether 100% accurate or not, it made you think. This time the Queen did appear more stoic than earlier seasons, but I found that to be completely understandable as the times depicted in this season the very monarchy itself was literally under siege - not a good time to get all emotional and wobbly. I imagine it was not the real Queen's favorite period either.Absolutely loved the episode involving the one time valet to the Duke of Windsor. Thought it was unique and touching. And I never knew that background of the Fayed family, and the fathers obsession with the royals.The episode involving Bashir's deceitful trickery to get Diana to do that disastrous BBC interview was really a shocker, and only recently been totally proven to be true, some 25 years later.As for Diana, if she was anything like the character portraying her in this season she was probably the most stupid and emotionally immature person imaginable. Good grief.I am not excusing Charles at all for duping her into marrying him when he new damn well he not only didn't love her but was in love with someone else. And blaming his parents for pressuring him is equally duplicitous as he had a hundred ways he could have ended that charade before ever walking down the aisle.Anyway, that's my two cents - and then some- but in all I enjoyed it. So relax and you will too.",7
"Final season is bad television.","Its hard to find something good to comment on in the final season, bearing in mind the show is often fictional and designed to make it appealing but also sensational (or example, many of the royals, based on good standard biographies, are quite simply dreadful people). At least recent fuss has made the producers highlight that it is a drama - because people not being very bright and all that.The cast of main actors this series are distractedly unconvincing. Diana's actor would have needed lengthy recovery time in a neck brace because her acting range is based upon ducking her neck forward then looking up with cow eyes. The Queen is more a of respectable middle class Englishwoman of the period dressed for Sunday church. She just doesnt convey any convicting sense of being regal. Similarly Prince Phillip is more of a nice old country solicitor. There is an extended focus on him early on and his interest in horse and carriage driving. Which he took up once past 50 we are told early on because playing polo was too demanding. A few days later he visits the mother of his child godaughter who has just died of cancer. They are obviously family intimates so its hard to stomach when the mother comments she understands he took up carriage driving after 50...because polo. Phillip must be in his late 70s or 80s in that scene. We've been told its his passion so for this close family friend to raise it as though she didnt know of it over the past 25+ years is silly and lazy script work, And on it goes, its just clumsy dull show.",3
"Brilliant Jewel Of A Show","I didn't want to watch this because I was never interested in the Royal Family, and certainly not in Queen Elizabeth. But here, you see her clearly, in exquisite detail, as a person. You also see her husband, her sister, those in her orbit and those who worked for her and in the government. Claire Foy is brilliant, Matt Smith as Philip and Vanessa Kirby as Margaret equally so. John Lithgow makes an amazing Churchill. Any complaints that an American should not play him are silly. JL is genius. And after all, Churchill was half American himself.The production value, the acting from everyone no matter how large or small his or her role, the writing, are all superb. There are a few missteps, particularly when the show toys with history for the sake of drama, in one case inventing a character to serve another's story (the weakest episode IMO). But that's an anomaly.Does this make me like Elizabeth more? No. I didn't know that much about who she was as a person. Now I know, and I think she's pretty much a cow. She didn't start off that way, but the writing was on the wall. Again and again she betrays her loved ones in matters large and small, all the while asserting the defense that she is doing it for the sake of The Crown and thus the country.But it isn't about the country. It's about the Crown, and they are not one and the same. And too often, it is, in some ways, just about her pride. The show doesn't flinch from this. It shows us how she has to relinquish her humanity bit by bit....or chooses to. I know others will disagree, feel sympathy for her, tell me I'm holding her to a double standard. Not at all. I do feel sympathy for her, but more so for those whom she betrays. Particularly her sister.Anyway, I am hooked on the show and highly recommend it. If the viewers find the Queen more of a decent person than I do, more power to them. My opinion of her doesn't make me enjoy the show any less. She is hardly the only character, and the show spends plenty of time on the actual business of governing the country, which she does only nominally. And the human drama, while sometimes wrenching, is riveting.BTW, go Anthony Eden. He's the boss.",10
"Why These Actresses?","I've recently started watching The Crown and have really enjoyed it, but when Season 3 started , I was shocked to see that Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret no longer have blue eyes! As they aged, somehow their eyes have turned to a very dark brown. How weird!",9
"Excellent Screenplay","Great storyline. Great acting, especially by Claire Foy and Matt Smith. Love the costumes and the cinematography. Excellent production. Every episode just keep you glued for more. Look forward to the next Season!",10
"Unique and phenomenal","The crown is one of the best shows in recent television. This show feels somehow incredibly organic, it makes you sympathize and connect with those people that you otherwise would never have. The ultimate depiction of this family and how their problems and pains surround something bigger, always something bigger: the crown, it's brilliant. The acting is phenomenal, every actor feels perfect for the role and becomes this characters in a way that I've never seen before in television. From the cold unforgettable cinematography, the interesting and unique editing, the majestic score, the production and costume design ( some of the most accurate and beautiful in tv history), the makeup, the writing, the stunning direction, everything is so well crafted and is just amazing that this show exists. It's enjoyable and highly entertaining, it works as a phenomenal look at the pass of time and some of the most important events in last century's history from the point of view of the royalty, but also from the normal people. It's a phenomenal contrast of society, pressure, and duty that colapses and converges in this masterpiece of a show. A unique and phenomenal piece of art that we wish would never end, as much as it will need to. Definitely one of Netflix's best, and for sure one of the best shows to watch on television. What a joy that this masterpiece of a show exists!",10
"A masterful series. Best TV Drama to date.","Incredibly eloquent in aesthetic, directing, acting, dialogue and, above all else, its exploration of the various philosophical attitudes held by different characters, and emotional heft of action and consequence in regards to (for some) seemingly mundane dilemmas. The series managed to establish a relatable, emotionally sophisticated exploration of a family (and politicians) we wouldn't, at least at first glance, believe we had much in common with. A series focused on unveiling the very human side behind a subject and setting which isn't often viewed under such a light. This show has a little bit of everything, and most definitely holds a lot of appeal to anyone remotely into drama. The only complaint I can see being made about The Crown is that the pacing can be a little slow, though this was not a problem for myself.",10
"One of Netflix's Best!","I'm watching this series for the second time. Obviously the Royal Family have its problems with the series, but I don't feel the writers have taken ridiculous liberties with the royal family's history. The acting, set creation, and locations are awesome. I'm no Royal Family history buff, so I can't really speak to the accuracy of the storyline, but I don't think it would have such great reviews if it were way off-base. I think it's only gotten better with each season. I binge-watched the latest one and started watching the entire series over again. I rarely re-watch a series, but this one is an exception. I'm looking forward to the next season.",8
"An extravagant and beautifully wrapped present","""Everyone in this system is a lost, lonely, irrelevant outsider apart from the one person, the only person, that matters. She is the oxygen we all breathe. The essence of all our duty. Your problem, if I may say is you seem to be confused about who that person is.""As someone who knew little about the royal family prior to watching Peter Morgan's magnum opus ""The Crown"", I found each episode to be extremely informative, addictive, and captivating, so much so that I had to fact-check every single detail. It's safe to say that ""The Crown"" is Netflix's most crowned achievement, and one of the best historical dramas ever made. Not only does it give viewers a glimpse into the life of the royal family but focuses on the more obscure aspects of the monarchy. The fourth season is literally the gold standard of television, mainly thanks to Emma Corrin and Josh O'Connor's Emmy-worthy performances. Season 4 will forever be a unique experience and a true masterwork. The artistry of the fourth season is unmatched. The Crown is the most expensive Netflix show ever produced. Its costume and production design is phenomenal. The series doesn't glamorize the institution but rather empathetically looks at the people who were forced to be a part of the system and how it crushed them. The Queen herself had to put her humanity aside for her duty as head of state. Funnily enough, before working on the Crown the creator Peter Morgan wasn't a royalist rather a Republican. It was only after he worked on two seasons of the royal drama that he became a firm royalist.Final verdict: 9.5/10.",9
"I literally felt suffocated and still kept on watching, that's how real it is !!!","I am not the kind of person who would watch a series like this. I am the least interested in Royalty and their ""Rich Mumbo Jumbo"". I watched this series just coz of one person....Princess Diana. She was a magical human being...a pure beautiful soul, who was driven to the very edge by morons who couldn't understand her, who couldn't love her, who didn't deserve her. She was living among robots. What's the purpose of being a queen if you can't even give a warm hug to your own daughter-in-law? How could you be expected to love your people if you can't even love and support your own family? How shallow can you be?
Was it Diana's fault that she was so charming? Was it her fault that she was so amazingly talented ? Was it her fault that she loved to be with the people and they loved her ? Inspite of the age gap, instead of being and acting mature the Prince got jealous of her, abused her, mocked her and slept with the other woman. Even when she promised to work hard on her marriage he squeezed her out. When she needed him, he blocked her and when she found that comfort in others' arms, he ridiculed her. And after all this bull**it if we still think that the royals are ""respectable"" and that we should ""look up to them"" then Dayumn....WE ARE THE MORONS !!That's all, sorry for the looooong review/ outburst of emotions...I loved the series. You should go for it.",9
"VERY DISAPPOINTING 4TH SEASON","The 4th season of ""THE CROWN""was very poor dull,dreary,boring and definitely the most boring season of the entire web series.The choice of events/incidents were very poorly chosen and handled.Only the ladies who acted as Lady Di and Margaret Thatcher respectively and the person who acted as Prince Charles were absolutely brilliant.Otherwise the balance of the entire cast were average at best.Olivia Colman was an absolute misfit as the Queen,with Claire Foy being a million times better than her.
3/10",7
"Started brilliantly then slowly lost its way","If you are going to produce drama that is based on historical fact, then stick to the facts and stop making stuff up.Season One was spot on, but by the time of Season Four, it slipped all too often into the mire of fiction. Portraying real people (even if they are ""Royal"", which somehow makes them less real), in fictional circumstances, is a travesty of truth and realism.The series is excellent at revealing the ludicrousness of ""Royalty"" with its privileges and quaint protocols that no-one with half a brain would give a toss about, but it is demeaning in my view to portray real people in fictional situations and pretend that it is fact. Fact and fiction are not overlapping categories.However, the parts that stick to the facts demonstrate clearly what a useless, expensive institution the Monarchy really is, only held together in the last decades by a person who has dedicated herself to the role she was given by historical accident. The character of the Queen I felt sympathy for. The rest of the entourage (family) compete amongst themselves to win the title of the most self-centred, egocentric, out of touch, stupid and overprivileged person in receipt of State Benefits.",5
"outstanding drama - exquisite tv show","Before watching it I was kind of sceptical about this, because I thought it would be boring, but I was totally wrong.This was an outstanding drama about the monarchy and although they can't know for sure that things happened exactly how they portrayeded them we know this drama is based on history.The script follows the history most of the times, excepting their conversations and sometimes the problems of the monarchy. (they made assumptions).The first season was my favourite. The actors were great and had amazing performances. What I really liked about this season is that they showed us an idea of how the queen was at the beginning. They also show us that Elizabeth and Phillip had marriage problems, however, their love was stronger.Throughout the series you can see how the years passed and how the things changed, but the monarchy was still there.I'm waiting for the final season !",10
"So great","Love this show and so authentic right down to the characters outfits. A lovely walk through the historical drama that is the British royalty.Each season brings new actors and actresses and they are all fantastic. The series begins with an inside look at the early reign of the queen, who ascended the throne at age 25 after the death of her father, King George VI. As the decades pass, personal intrigues, romances, and political rivalries are revealed that played a big role in events that shaped the later years of the 20th century.Just love this show and can't wait to see what they have in store for next season.",10
"Season 4","Olivia Colman continues to show why she is an amazing actress. I wasn't too sure about her choice for Queen Elizabeth II, following the viewing of Season 3. However she has changed my opinion with this Season 4 performance. The storyline between Charles and Diana is superbly written. The main criticism I have is the performance of Gillian Anderson, which is a shame as she is an exceptional actress. Her portrayal of one the most important female political figures of the last century, Mrs Thatcher, is quite frankly poor. It is almost caricature of the ""Iron Lady"". Her mannerisms are exaggerated far too much, and the less said about her voice the better. But overall I really enjoyed the Season, and cannot wait till 2022, for Season 5, which of course will bring new actors to the roles.......",9
"Love it!","Binged watched all of the series. Each and every episode I learnt something new about the Royal Family - it's fab.",10
"surprisingly entertaining","To be honest i'm not a big fan of the royal family and have no interest in them at all but this series is actually quite enjoyable. i think the queen is played really well, feel like i like the queen a bit more than i did before watching this, especially after learning she dislikes thatcher lol. feel like the voice the actress does for thatcher is a bit forced and irritating at times but either way they all do a great job of conveying their part to the extent where i forget it's not a documentary at times! think the casting is brilliant and the way the stories are told is engaging, even for somebody who has no interest in the royals like myself. thought it would be a chore to sit through but find myself interested when watching it :)",10
"Much improved with Olivia Colman","First two seasons, not so much. 3rd season was so fun to watch because Olivia Colman is so fun to watch. Tobias Menzies is also an Emmy-worthy addition - tremendous job. Helena Bonham-Carter almost manages to wreck the whole watching experience as she is sub-par. But thankfully, she doesn't have nearly as much screen time and Colman and Menzies. They are delightful!",9
"I'm literally obsessed!","After watching the first episode I was glued to couch.. literally glued! I'm so drawn to this story even though I was never a fan of the royal family. I like that we can get totally different view of this people and actually see them as persons that have same problems that us ""normal"" people do + everything that goes with the crown. And I was constant checking the facts while watching and google for more details lol .. Obsessed!!!",10
"Indeed one of the best shows","This dramatic, thourough and explicit tale of the life of Queen Elizabeth, is often considered one of the best TV shows ever made, taking the world by storm, and recounting a thourough and impressive drama throughout its many seasons.I can do nothing less than agree with said sentiment, this being one of my all time favourite shows, incredibly well acted, very finely written, and encompassing many important and interesting parts of history.All of the several actresses portraying the Queen indeed do an incredible job, and feels very nuanced, similar yet different enough, through different parts of her life.The cinematography, cutting and editing is incredible, very feature worthy and very beautifully put together.Overall, indeed an incredible and ever recommended show!",9
"What went wrong?","3d season is horrible. I just couldn't believe that I am watching continuation of the show.",7
"Watch the first 2 seasons then give up...","Seasons 1 and 2 were some of the best TV we've watched. My husband has never really been a fan of the monarchy, but this really showed him a different light. Season 3, what?! The cast are dour and miserable. We love Olivia, but this just doesn't work for her. We're on the verge of giving up in episode 5 as it's so dull, slow paced and frankly, a disaster after the first 2 seasons.",5
"Exceptionally well done","Great casting, acting, set design, writing, period costumes. Just an excellent series and although it is a series and they do take some liberties with facts to make it more dramatic, as I have researched things covered in the series, I have found it to be very close to the truth. Fascinating look at the world behind the gates of Buckingham Palace where sometimes I like the characters and other times I identify with their critics. Very well balanced production that shows the virtues and flaws of the royals.",10
"Perfection !","To learn to know, love, wonder, pity, reach, warm to, respect, distance oneself but always and foremost learn to understand these abstract public characters is in itself an accomplishment seldom achieved. Cinematography, acting, scenery, the music ! and the directing - all grand, slow but so wunderfully intimate and tense this is the absolute top and rarely matched. The Crown is a 10 on all fronts ! We've fallen in love with this masterpiece.",10
"The Best of Television/Motion Picture Art","I saw the coronation of Queen Elizabeth, which remains a vivid memory after all these years. It was one of the first televised major historical events. Also, the young Queen was the cover girl of every magazine and newspaper. The Crown is a fascinating depiction of the life of Elizabeth Windsor from childhood through decades of reign over the British Commonwealth. Beautifully presented in all the splendor of royalty, the story spans the globe and the times. It was so interesting to see all the members of the family and others brought to life through excellent performances all around. I've always loved the Queen, and I loved The Queen too.",10
"Fascinating drama","I never been a royal watcher or royal follower. What little I knew about this dysfunctional family was mostly from the humanitarian tours Diana Spencer made to New York. and the marriage that seized our attention on this side of the pond on the three prime OTA television networks (ABC,NBC, & CBS) at that time, I wasn't even a teenager yet when I watched the marriage live. I am a former New Yorker and I remember how big of a deal it was when she came.I gave this show a chance not expecting to fully see the whole first season. But to my own surprise it captivated me for two weeks while I binge watch all four seasons! It really is that good. I really wished Netflix added additional mini videos after each episode that pointed out what was fact and what was fiction. Luckily, we have Youtube videos from dieheart royal followers that do that for Netflix. But had this series been made on HBO, HBO probably would have added those extras.The casting changes between seasons 1-2 and 3-4 did require getting used to. I had built a bond with the original cast members. I don't know why the makers couldn't just have applied some hollywood sfx to age the original cast members. Nevertheless, I did get over it and built a new bond with the newer cast members. The most difficult was the change of Vanessa Kirby with Helena Bonham Carter. The two actresses that played the part of Princess Margaret. I just don't see what those two actresses portrayals shared in common although. Vanessa Kirby is a phenomenal actress, by the way. On the positive size of casting, Elizabeth Debicki was spot on for Lady Diana. She nailed the part.Unfortunately, I am feeling the withdrawal symptoms now that I completed season 4. Two more years until we find out the conclusion. But the real royals shouldn't be concerned too much over their portrayals in this show. If anything, it sowed the curiosity seed to find out more about them. At least it has for me. I have so many questions now. The biggest question I have is why does the British government even bother informing the Queen about state affairs if she is unable to show or express an opinion or do anything about it?This inability to express a political opinion perhaps makes me understand why the royals seem so cold and distant. They have to restrain themselves to protect the legitimacy of the crown. It doesn't seem to be just because they are royal upper noses. I can only imagine how frustrating that must be to live a lifetime like that. I also gotta love that this granny is also a badass. She rides and breeds horses and hunts with guns. I think we see a huge ironic contrast between the Queen and Margaret Thatcher out in the field. The Queen, stalking and hunting her prey with camouflage in the field while the working class background Prime Minister with a royal blue dress. The irony in that scene was very memorable. LOL.",9
"Would've given a higher rating if it wasn't for the lazy recasting in season 3","I had anticipated for some disruptions to the continuity in season 3 what with the complete recasting of characters but found the lack of attention to detail (some, major details) very distracting and questionable.The very first thing that stood out to me was the change of the eye colour in both Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret from blue to brown??? Considering that both actresses who played the characters from the previous two seasons had expressive blue eyes and conveyed a lot of emotions through them in closeups, I felt they should've been a bigger factor to consider in the recasts. Plus, the real Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret also have blue eyes?? It felt like they went a bit too rogue with their choices here.I'm personally a big fan of Helena bon ham carter but she's completely a wrong cast for Princess Margaret and there's absolutely no continuity, completely different facial features, body shape, mannerism, and she looks really good for her age but still way older than her characters age. (This goes for Colman too).I just couldn't help but question why they couldn't have made the transition more seamless.",10
"Heavi-est is the head that wears....","Bravo! Our obsession with all things regal and statecraft is celebrated by this finest shining achievement which is a most in-depth series dramatizing the burdens associated with having flesh and blood constitution beneath the almighty weight of the British crown; family ties, bureaucratic entanglements, the intricacies of regal obligations to the state and the many different peoples of many different countries within the Commonwealth, and the difficulties of remaining personally separate, differentiated, and completely silent about how difficult it all is to manage well, or if it can even be managed at all. And... more interestingly... what really happens when it all gets mucked up and goes sideways. Season One available and streaming in-full and entirely without interruptions right now at Netflix.com",8
"New cast and storylines are a joke...","First two seasons are fantastic. I give them a solid 9. I base my rating on those two seasons alone. Claire Foy is the Queen and does a remarkable job. The show is focused on her and Philip and hands down have perfect chemistry towards each other. The show revolves around the queen... Now jump ahead to season 3... which I give a rating of 4Netflix changed every character and now the show is a joke. We as viewers get use to style of the show and now you change it all up and for what??? For better ratings??? Well you won't get that now that's for sure. The show now has all kinds of small side stories that nobody cares about let alone want to watch. You had a great show Netflix and now all you have is garbage... guaranteed this is the beginning of the end for
The Queen. Which is sad cause the first two seasons are outstanding.Way to go Netflix!!! You ruined a great show with new cast and direction...",10
"I want Claire foy","Why on earth did they not just use make up artists for Claire foy to look older. Season 3 is so boring it's all about horse breeding and astronauts. The new queen can't act as good as Claire foy in this series. I fell asleep watching this so many times.",10
"S1-4: top of the line. S5: sinks to the bottom","I realize it's difficult to put a number on a show that rocks for several seasons and then takes a nosedive. Especially that I do not recognize the numbers in between. They make no sense to me. What is a difference between 6.4 and 7.7? How would that difference translate to what a movie is worth? So I give 1 to stuff that I consider was a waste of time, 10 to movies I recommend to my friends and 5 to something in between. But TV series are difficult in that regard. I also think numbers tell very little what people actually think of what they watched. So I prefer to read what they have to say about it. With thousands of opinions it's really difficult to get any meaningful search results from opinions that do not come with extreme scores. So I usually start with long posts of prolific reviewers that give a production ""1"" - for example. And start from there. Yeah, I have learned to go around those character limits in a way that is more impressive than just repeating lines to meet the quota ;) *wink*That being said, I hope the introduction was as engaging and meaningful as any of royalty's speeches done before.I consider The Crown a great series. 1-4 season to be precise. 5th is. Yeah, what exactly IS this? A soap opera? Return to Hogwarts? Renewal of The Wire? I am sorry, but this happens to some particular actors and their roles, they take them and they can never ever be looked at without us thinking of them in that way. It doesn't mean they're necessarily bad actors, it means they are very specific and sometimes grown into their particular roles. Patrick Stewart is a perfect example of this. He could never ever be anyone but Picard, despite being a great actor (yes, Xavier is Picard on wheels). So yeah, having Hogwarts b**ch as the Queen is a subversion. She suddenly becomes mean and evil in S5. Actually, all Royalty become like that. You almost expect them to turn into lizard people. Subtlety, intricaties, difficult choices disappear and are substituted with an assumption the Royalty are like Vampire kin bound to suck all of our blood. And then there is the boredom. 3rd ep and my wife turns to knitting while I play games on my iPad. This was not the case before. Where is the emotion of Aberfan? Fear of Act of God? Joy of Company of Men? I could go on. The fifth season is a boring dreck trying to convince us The Queen and all involved in ""the System"" are either it's captors or evil, self centered and one faceted oppressors that seek nothing else but riches, debauchery and control.5th season is like saying ""we've lied about the Royalty for 4 seasons. Now comes the truth"". Oh boy. Go straight for the lizard people, it will at least be somewhat entertaining.",7
"Should have quit when it was ahead","I had to change my rating from a 10 to a 7 and actually I may not even finish watching season 6. I used to love this series, especially when Claire Foy played the young Queen Elizabeth. Matt Smith was also my favorite as the young Prince Philip. The acting was good and the storyline fascinating. I also enjoyed seeing the interior of Buckingham Palace. I also found the struggles of the young Prince Charles interesting. Now with Princess Diana's story it seems to have become a cheap soap opera. The moony looks of the actress playing Diana just get tiresome. This was a classy series at one time but they let it go on too long. They should have quit while they were ahead.",8
"Entertaining, fictional, propagandist","The whole series is created to muster sympathy and support for Charles. Played by an actor infinitely better looking than him. Same goes for QEII. While the other way round for Margaret and Diana.Young William looked and acted like a psycho and a teen Harry could be inspired by Jughead. Oh those hair. By casting alone, you could guess if these characters would be portrayed in positive or negative light in that season. Also, no reference of Andy. Wonder why (wink)?Anyway, it's impossible to create a series on BRF and show the monarchs and future monarchs as anything less than perfect. And this series does not stray off that path either.So from authenticity point of view, there's none. Its not that the circumstances are fictional, the show covers very real events, capturing the reality scene by scene and dress by dress except the moral is the exact opposite of what is popularly known/assumed. Its like someone desperately wants to settle the score.Having said that, well made, dramatic, with very high production value. Watch it for entertainment, and then flip the storyline shown to reach closer to the truth.",5
"A Masterpiece","This show will go down in history as a masterpiece. that's a fact. The casting is amazing , the acting is amazing, etc.. There are seldom true 10 out of 10 shows. This show is a 10/10.
My only issue is the way they talk about Margaret Thatcher, and other conservatives. Thatcher was the 7th longest serving Prime Minister of the UK, and the longest serving in the 20th century. Even in the US she was an icon. She and Reagan helped bring on a new age of freedom and prosperity in the entire world.... The show makes the guy who broke into Buckingham Palace (twice) look more just and deserving of sympathy than Thatcher. The show is perfection, other than a few of these biases. All that said, obviously we can't prevent all bias, and the show will be remembered for a very long time to come.",10
"dazzling performance by Helen Bothom Carte","HBC performance as Princess Margaret is nothing short of award winning As counters foil to Coleman's ER II is take the relationship of these two women to next level in Episode 3.2 Enjoy.",9
"Season 5: That's what I was waiting for","I really liked the first 4 seasons of The Crown, the only seasons I had problems with was season 3. Later,
I had to realize that the new actors caused that feeling, and it took some time to get used to these new faces.I found myself in the same situation with season 5, the only difference was that I was prepared, I knew what to expect.I am very very satisfied with season 5, especially with the wonderful performance of Imelda Staunton, Jonathan Pryce and Leslie Manville. I can imagine how difficult it could be to write the script of these season after the queen's death, but I truly think that the writers did a great job.The closer they come to 2022, the more people will criticize the storyline, as many of them experienced the different events and situations personally. From a point of view. It might be different from how they saw those things 30 years ago, but it's absolutely okay.The Crown is not a documentary, it's fictional drama series. I do not think that we should always try to look for differences between the storyline and real life.",10
"Finally an excellent Original Series from Netflix","Outstanding series that tells the story as accurately as it can without unnecessary, irrelevant, scenes that do not belong in the script. There is no foul language, gross sex scenes, and characters that do not fit. Many of the Netflix original shows have are inundated with way too much gay lesbian sex scenes that really do not fit. Nothing against gay and lesbian sex as long it fits in the story and is displayed with some graciousness. Same is true with inserting characters of diverse background just to be socially correct or to pander. There are many series and shows where it makes sense because it all fits. It is very easy to spot forced insertion.",10
"A different perspective on why this is so engaging, and worthwhile viewing","I'll start by saying that for me, this is a ten out of ten. Others describe the excellent production quality, as well as the cast, so I'll put a different spin on ""why"" this is so interesting to me, and might be (ought to be?) interesting to others.I'm not a ""royal watcher"", so I don't spend time wondering about (or worrying about) what goes on in the monarchy of the UK (and it Commonwealth). But the focal point of this series is on Elizabeth, and one cannot be somewhat amazed, and curious, about her life. I'm in my 60's, and she's been on the throne since before I was even born, so I am, at a minimum, intrigued by her longevity, especially considering how she ended up on the throne in the first place.Remember that for the first ten years of her life, there was little expectation that she would ever do anything other than live on the royal family periphery. But, her uncle's abdication, and father's early death, changed all of that, and only in her mid-20's, she found herself thrust onto the throne.What makes Elizabeth so interesting? Just contrast the state of our world, at beginning of her reign, with a few simple facts: There were no man-made objects in space (and wouldn't be for another five years); Computers were in their infancy, and were as large as some people's home; WW II had only ended 5 ½ years earlier; With the possible exception of the monarchy, women in any position of power, was pretty much unheard of.All of the things that we take for granted today, be it technology, spacecraft that are now in interstellar space, etc., women in leadership roles in business and government those transformations have all transpired, while she has been on the throne. With such drastic change, one can easily imagine a variety of reasons how/why the British monarchy could easily have lost some (or all) of its relevance. But somehow, if anything, it would seem that just the opposite has happened, and one cannot help but think that Elizabeth is the reason why.And also, as an American, even Elizabeth's lineage becomes a thing of interest. Queen Victoria (arguably the most renowned monarch before Elizabeth II) was Elizabeth's great, great grandmother, and Victoria's grandfather was George III (yeah we sorta had a bit of a war of independence with him, once upon a time). And here is the current monarch, Elizabeth, George's direct descendant(and not that many generations removed), who has been alive for more than _one-third_ of our nation's existence, and on the throne for more than _one-quarter_ of its existence. Relatively speaking, we (Americans) are still not that far removed from the throne that she occupies, which generates (for me), yet another level of interest in exploring her life and reign.For me, this series boils down to an opportunity to learn more about someone, who it would be hard to deny, is a fairly remarkable woman, and who (with a few missteps along the way), seems to have managed to shepherd the institution that she sits atop, through one of the most rapidly changing eras in the history of humankind. It's hard to not be interested in a person who can pull that off, and imagine that there might be some interesting lessons, or at least, insights, that might be drawn from her life.The fact that this ""learning opportunity"" comes in the form of a fantastic production, with a fantastic cast, ends up being the icing on an already interesting cake. Certainly, there may be some ""royal soap opera"" moments, but never forget that this is also a significant history lesson. I have thoroughly enjoyed this initial series, and can't wait for what comes next.",10
"Best season in the series","The Crown, season 5 is outstanding, best of all seasons. Script is rivetting, hard hitting, doesn't compromise. Photography excellent, editing superb in creating that heavy atmosphere of family in crisis that doesn't sag. Elizabeth played by Imelda Staunton projects the painful turmoil in the family keeping grace, poise and dignity as a monarch should.Diana played by Elizabeth Debicki is able to portray the emotional breakdown of Diana's pathetic life so well that for once one really feels being witness in her privacy. Charles is portrayed by Dominic West. Does real Charles constantly screw his mouth while speaking?Real life story of the most famous monarchy of last hundred years is mesmerizing and feels so human, so relatable to common people.At a time when the Queen has just died, Charles is the monarch at last with all the baggage of his past as portrayed here, holding back nothing, it will now move on to season 6 with lots of frank expectations. Looking forward.",9
"Cinematography, stories, until all the cast are very good indeed","The Crown was first released in early November 2016, directly in ten episodes. The first episode tells the story of his marriage to King Philip in 1947.
The story of Elizabeth is unique to follow, Urbaners. Since married to King Philip, Queen Elizabeth's life has changed. The father, namely King George, his health had declined sharply, then his mother Elizabeth was ready to give up the throne to the child. The event of marriage until the appointment of Queen Elizabeth 2 is the center of the story of the television series The Crown.You have to watch this series because the story is very interesting, and I can't wait to see the newest season..",10
"Great, opulent, fascinating family drama about the Royals","The most expensive series in the history of Netflix, The Crown is a 10- part series about the early years of Elizabeth as Queen, and the effect that her rule had on her husband and sister.As the niece of the King, Elizabeth and her sister Margaret enjoyed all the perks of royalty without being in line for the throne. This ended when King Edward (Alex Jennings) abdicated. Having no issue, his brother Bertie (Jared Harris) became George VI. While Elizabeth (Claire Foy) and her husband, Prince Philip (Matt Smith) were in Africa, King George died. And greatness was thrust upon the shoulders of Elizabeth.The series shows Elizabeth's adjustment, her dealings with people like Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, her Uncle David, the ex-King and now Duke of Windsor, and learning ultimately that there was a procedure, and while she ruled, she needed to follow the decisions of others.One of her biggest family problems concerned her sister Margaret (Vanessa Kirby) and her affair with a divorced man, Peter Townsend (Ben Miles). It's hard to imagine nowadays how scandalous divorce was, and in this case, worse because it looked like Townsend had left his wife for Margaret. This caused many problems for the Crown and between the sisters. Sadder yet, though the relationship was broken up, Margaret ended up divorced herself. There were also issues with Philip piloting - it seemed as if many family matters had to be approved of at a higher level. It must have been very frustrating. (Divorce was still an issue when Jacqueline Kennedy was invited to the Palace, and the Palace refused to let her bring her divorced sister Lee. ""But she's my host,"" Jacqueline objected, ""and my sister!"" Couldn't bring her.)The series spares nothing in terms of opulence, the copying of actual gowns worn and other fashion looks of the era, and manages to work in actual footage of the coronation as people watched it on black and white television. The actors do a magnificent job, particularly Claire Foy who somehow IS the young Elizabeth; John Lithgow as Winston Churchill, Matt Smith as Philip, Alex Jennings as the Duke of Windsor. Though Vanessa Kirby is a wonderful Margaret, the real Margaret was actually more beautiful, though Kirby shows her flirtatious personality and charisma. Foy and Kirby also demonstrate beautifully the subtle and not-so-subtle moments of rivalry between the two women.In terms of historical accuracy, from what I know, the series is accurate with a few caveats. One isn't really the fault of the production. It's said that Churchill's wife had the portrait that Sutherland did of her husband destroyed and supervised the destruction; in truth, the servants took it upon themselves to burn it as it was just somewhere taking up space. Clementine is reported to have said, ""That's what I would have done.""Also, the Duchess of Windsor was not present during King George's abdication speech. I believe the story of Churchill and his secretary was fictionalized to bring in his awareness of the hospital problems.The producers worked very hard to make The Crown as accurate as possible, working with historians, biographers, someone who actually worked in the Palace, newsreels, and newspapers. As with all non- fiction dramas, however, there were some liberties with the timing of events.Truly excellent - can't wait for season 2.",10
"Not sure how it's better than fetishizing narcos","It's an ok show, in terms of the way it's done at least. Still, I have to protest the very gesture of romanticizing the life of the monarchy and so-called ""nobility"". Even if, as it's becoming increasingly clear in the context of today's politics, monarchy does have its strong suites, I can't help but feel that there is a fetishization at work here, and I don't like it. So 6/10 it is.",6
"Poor casting","Dominic West and Elizabeth Debiki are not believable in their roles. I find season 5 very boring. Dominic West just appears too old and completely unlikeable in any way. The only character with interest is Margaret. So I'll stick with it as much as I'm disappointed.I didn't expect it to go downhill like this season has. I'm very curious about the casting. Jonathan Price is a fabulous actor and he doesn't disappoint but Dominic West is an atrocious choice to play Charles. Elizabeth Debiki as Dianna appears like a towering giraffe with one facial expression. Bored and sullen. I just can't skip this season. I'll plow my way through.",4
"Brilliant","Another brilliant portrayal of another British icon by an American. She had large shoes to fill after John Lithgow's phenomenal portrayal of the iconic Winston Churchill. And fill them she did. Gillian Anderson deserves several awards for her Margaret Thatcher",9
"The Crown Jewel of TV","The Crown's creator Peter Morgan had already had a lot of experience with royalty-inspired films and TV series, such as Henry VIII (2003), The Queen (2006) and The Last King of Scotland (2006), but this is definitely the peak of his career.Well-crafted and beautifully produced, The Crown is simply a joy to watch. It is a tale about a young and rather inexperienced woman that takes on a very serious duty she is still not prepared for. Thanks to the help and support of her Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill, Elizabeth II is slowly but surely grows into the much- beloved Queen, who in 2017 became the only British monarch to celebrate a Sapphire Jubilee. You do not have to be a royalist to enjoy it.The Crown offers a stunning portrayal of the mid-20th century and of historical and political circumstances of the time. It also gives the audience a chance to learn more about 'how the other half lives', and most interestingly, about the personalities and private lives of the British Royal Family. In spite of some inaccuracies, The Crown still manages to send a powerful message: great power and great privileges come with great restrictions and great responsibilities.Claire Foy and John Lithgow simply own the roles they are playing, The Queen and Sir Winston Churchill, respectively. Those two deserve all the accolades they have received for their performances. Jared Harris shines as George VI; although he looks nothing like him, his stellar performance makes you forget about that. Eileen Atkins is also great as Queen Mary, although her performance shows Queen Mary in a different light than the usual accounts present her. Matt Smith, Pip Torrens and Jeremy Northam are all very convincing in their roles.However, I have to disagree with some of the cast choices. Vanessa Kirby is pretty and charming, but not enough to play the late Princess Margaret. Alex Jennings gives a great performance as the former king Edward VIII, now the Duke of Windsor, but for some reason, his voice in this drives me crazy. But the biggest mismatch, in my opinion, is Victoria Hamilton as The Queen Mother. That is most certainly not the woman Adolf Hitler once described as 'the most dangerous woman in Europe'.In spite of some minor flaws, the first series of The Crown is great enough to make you want to see the second one, which, given that it will portray the Suez crisis, sounds even more exciting.",8
"History revisited with added fiction to entertain.","A stunning production with top class acting I have watched the first 3 seasons and as much as the likeness to the royal family and prime ministers has a lot to be desired the acting is of a class that you can easily overlook that comparison.
Historical events are accurate even if the conversations and personal views seen are possibly not and this is were the viewer needs to understand that there is much fiction involved as there is factual and on that basis to view the series as a writer's interpretation of what may have transpired rather than actual still a. Stunning production",9
"Even better than Series 2","I have just finished watching Series 3 and thoroughly enjoyed it. The change of cast worked perfectly for me, Olivia Coleman plays the Queen as she is, and Helen Bonham Carter is perfect as Princess Margaret. The biggest change for the better though is Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip. For me, Matt Smith was always the weak link in Series 1 & 2. Watching him, I often found myself wandering, what on earth the Queen saw in him, but Menzies brings a completely new, more adult dimension to the character and we can clearly see why the relationship has worked so well and how important Philip has been to Elizabeth.Series 3 has brought in other equally good actors, Josh O'Connor is excellent as Prince Charles and whilst Erin Doherty as Princess Anne, only has small scenes, she steals the show whenever she appears. I loved the storylines as well, obviously some dramatic license has been taken, but the writing is so good, that it always makes perfect sense.Bravo to all concerned and I can't wait for Season 4, when Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher enter the stage.",10
"Exquisitely detailed both grand and intimate - just some miscasting","It is a testament to how good this series is that a dramatization of such a well known person and such well known events could be so mesmerizing. The detail is just mind boggling. There is such painstaking detail to recreate each scene from Commonwealth tours to minor ones. The sets are sumptuous and the costumes are perfect. No wonder it cost so much to make. The writing is superb with such good dialog in the intimate scenes that one only imagined before. Just finished season 1, all 10 episodes and each one is better than the last. Quite shocking to see on screen (even though it is known) is the vitriolic hatred Edward VIII had for the rest of the Windsors due to the treatment of Wallis.Some of the outstanding aspects of this first season are the handling of marriage with divorced persons - both with Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson and with Princess Margaret's love for the divorced Peter Townsend. A well handled angle is the difficult position the Queen finds herself in. Even marital conflict is shown with Prince Philip portrayed rather negatively. Do feel more sympathy for the Queen after watching this series.The flaw in this series is the jarring miscasting of some of the characters. Jared Harris looks too different from George VI and the actress who plays the Queen Mother is also terribly miscast - she should have been a plumper more round looking actress. They don't capture their essences. Vanessa Kirby is a bit indelicate for Margaret - maybe a bit large. Claire Foy does a good imitation of the Queen's accent but she has a rather hesitant look - more suitable for the household staff than the Queen. She doesn't look regal. But maybe she will change later. Physically her face is rather too different. Surprisingly Matt Smith the weird actor from Dr Who although uglier than Prince Phillip does capture his essence. John Lithgow even though too tall acts so well as Churchill it's quite award worthy. But the errors in casting don't prevent this series being outstanding television.",9
"Season 3 was good","There seems to be a lot of hate against season 3. I think this mainly stems from the new actors and the way they're playing their character. I think what you have to keep in mind is that its just generally in the nature of people to become more dull and less enchanting when they get older. I think they did An excellent job portraying each character according to their age and I alsof think the actors were a great fit. If you dont like the season it seems to me maybe that's because you don't like people getting older, not because the quality of the show went down.",8
"End the crown!","After seeing the Diane's chapters: the crown in England should be stopped once and for all. This caricature of a queen and her imbacile child ( future king of England) should simply perish!",9
"You won't regret it","I never knew a silent and drama show could be this much interesting. I have always been a fan of si-fi,action, thriller that'll keep me edge of my seat everytime I watch it.
This show is something you should really try it's entertaining and at the same time informative and ofcourse full of drama.",10
"Yawn...for Season Three","Maybe it is good to quit while ahead. Season Three has some great actors like Olivia Colman, Helena Bonham Carter and the rising star Josh O'Connor but the story line is totally soapy and gone awry. Suggest you watch it before bedtime; will help you go to sleep. 6/10 only because the costumes and setting are still pretty good.",6
"Netflix and their intercuts.... sigh","The overuse of intercuts and flashbacks in this season is ill advised. It drains a lot of the emotion from the story.This is a Netflix thing lately, most of their shows now use this technique liberally, and few of them yse it well.Diana's trip to NYC in Ep10 is a good example of the failure of this technique. Audio montages of various news people setting the scene is cheap exposition, but fails to capture the importance of Diana's visit to the Aids ward, and drains it of all emotional power.",5
"Wonderful series!","While the story may have some questionable triths, it is amazing. Each lady who played the queen should get an academy award. Well really every person should. This series is a model of a series to come in the future.Entertaining? Yes I got lost in the story many times as a series should do to people watching it.Did we fall in love with Claire foy yes for sure. The truth is I had never heard of her before the crown and I seen her dow like eye and I was like wow.Hats of to all who made this series. I know it will be a favorite to so many people for all time. To the royals we loved you then we were mad then we seen your humanity and loved you again. God save the King seriously we hope you get saved!",10
"Absolutely Brilliant !","I have never been very good at writing reviews, but The Crown inspired me enough to get an IMDb account in order for me to do so.I have never been so captivated by anything as much as I have with this series. Bravo to the creators of this series for it has been executed brilliantly !Right up there with Downton Abbey, & House Of Cards. I would even go as far as saying that it exceeds both of those.Acting, storyline, costumes, cinematography and pace all exceptional. Bravo to creator Peter Morgan and to all the cast and crew as well as to Netflix !",10
"Best show in years","This is the best TV Show in years. It makes the audience love the Royal Family, understand them, and more than anything else makes people understand, realize the hard work Her Majesty has and has been doing throughout her Reign. All the Actors are amazing, but I would want to add that Ms Foy and Matt Smith are just incredible, so much talent, class, reality, and so good looking :). The different locations as the Royal Family's Residences, the countryside locations are stunning, I have not done it yet but will google whether the shootings were done in the actual Palaces. I hope the second season will not be long to start - Thank you for this great show and can't wait for the next seasons !!",10
"Bring Claire foy back","Season one and two is amazing season three a disaster An absolute disaster I have no words",10
"Slightly less enjoyable S03 than the previous two...","I loved the first two seasons of this show and was looking forward to this one. Olivia Colman, a real-life acting queen who never ceases to amaze, and Helena Bonham Carter, delightful in anything she's in, were both terrific here, while Erin Doherty as Princess Anne and Tobias Menzies as Philip were uncannily like the real-life people. The casting overall was great, and as usual, the production was sumptuous and top-notch. But the season as a whole was kind of a letdown from the first two, because each episode had a different focus without much tying it together (and basically I just wanted lots more of the Princesses, Margaret and Anne). The writing was too on the nose in some places, but I did end up feeling more sympathy for Charles, in how his family contrived to keep him from marrying Camilla, and this season seemed to be winding up for S04, which covers 1979-1992 and will feature Diana (which is what we've all been waiting for). I did enjoy it, but having Prince Andrew constantly in the news and knowing he's a sexual predator who won't be held accountable for his crimes due to his privilege, took away a bit of my pleasure and reinforced my belief the entire British monarchy is an unnecessary anachronism in a modern society.",8
"Astonishing","Fascinating as always. What a good season.
And really, Olivia Colman did such a great job in depicting the Queen in the show.
The show also allowed me to get more familiar with some of the big events in history, like Aberfan, or the Apolo Mission.",9
"Outstanding","One of the finest examples of acting, storytelling and production I have have ever had the pleasure of seeing.",10
"Hurrah for 1776!","Rewatching The Crown---am now on something like S4E3. If ever there was a justification for the American Revolution, this series is it, as there is not a likable or sympathetic UK royal, semi-royal, upper-class or parlimentarian in the bunch. Also, no case put forward for ANY monarchy to exist in the 21st Century. (I suspect the producers/ writers are in actuality IRA/ UK Nationalist fifth columnists. 🤣)As to the production: True or fictionalized Windsor family characterizations and actions aside, the abrupt, unwarrented, and illogical recasting of the entire family in S3 (one year after S2 but the characters are MANY years older---and, for Margaret, several inches shorter!) spoils the epic's continuity. For me, this gaffe hangs negatively over the credibility/ enjoyment of S3/S4---with one exception: Josh O'Connor as Charles. Spot on, as they say. He really nails it.8 out of 10 for cinematography, costuming/atmosphere, and engaging storytelling---whether the last element be entirely accurate or no. And, just to add to the chorus, the S3 Aberfan episode was beautifully haunting, heartbreaking. Well done, but there should have been more of an epilog.",8
"Used to be a 10, but season 3 a big disappointment","While Olivia Colman is a great actress, it is a poor choice for the role. After the magic Claire Foy it is a clear fail.",6
"Great show up till season 4","What a great show up till season 4 then it's turned into an utter waste of time
Talk about driving off a cliff",1
"Season four","I so eagerly awaited series 4, having enjoyed the first three so much, but I have really struggled with the portrayal of Margaret Thatcher by Gillian Anderson. She, and her make up artists seem to have turned Thatcher into a cartoon character with the over-big hair and the over emphasised plumey accent. Although I never felt Olivia Coleman portrayed the queen as accurately and as sharply as Claire Foy, I have managed to adapt to the change. I could never get used to Anderson's Thatcher.On a more positive note, Emma Corrin as Diana Spencer is absolutely ace. A marvellous piece of casting and she captures how I remember the young princess so accurately. As Foy IS the young queen, so is Corrin Diana.",9
"The correct form that deserves to represent The British royal family","One of the most beautiful series I have watched ... A master piece of creativity and mastery in acting, directing and photography... Every episode is considered an artistic epic and all the actors were beyond excellent ... When you watch the series in all its parts, you will not feel the time or the number of episodes because you will go back in time in each episode and feel that you are living with the events in every moment. ... The series I consider to be the correct form that deserves to represent the House of Winsor and The British royal family ... really thank you for this amazing work .",9
"Excellent series","It is obvious from the start that this series is going to be highly polished and superbly produced. Everything about it is excellent from the acting to the settings, the costumes to the dialogue. There is very little to find fault with. The plotting is brilliant and keeps you wanting more but I have trouble with the characters or, at least, most of them. Suspension of disbelief is one thing but to expect the viewer to warm to a cast of characters mostly made up of arrogant, cruel, overly-privileged and emotionally stunted people is asking too much. 8 stars for the production et al, 1 star for the dreadful people.",9
"Drama not history","This is not something to watch if you want a historically accurate documentary. It is, however, a truly magnificent drama, and brilliantly acted throughout. The skill of this writing is that it comes over as totally plausible, and the historical events are woven together beautifully.Olivia Coleman is not Claire Foy, but both actors portray a brilliantly consistent QE2.I wrote this having just binged series 4, and I do hope the next is as good.UPDATE AFTER SERIES 5
Before watching S5 I had seen the massive media storm that greeted its release. Having watched the whole series in a few days, I am shocked at the media response to it. Their protests are naive, and the criticisms totally unfounded. S5 continues the drama of the earlier parts with no loss of quality. The scripting, directing, screenplay, acting are all superb. For my money, Imelda Staunton got closer to the late queen's mannerisms than did Olivia Coleman. Elizabeth Debicki was remarkable in her depiction of Princess Di's manner and demeanour. If I was to give a rating for S5 alone, I'd drop my 10 to 9 for one reason alone. The focus of S5 was almost entirely on a single topic: royal romances. While this was interesting, I slightly preferred the more diverse range of subject matter in some of the earlier work.Long live The Crown.UPDATE AFTER SERIES 6
I had some fears that S6 would not maintain the standard. There were a couple of tricky episodes just after the half way point, but I feel that Peter Morgan made the best possible job of the material he needed to cover. The final few episodes were superb. The screenplay writing and direction were faultless. I particularly loved the appearances of the younger Elizabeth, brilliantly handled.I think some have commented that the whole show was anti-monarchist. I completely disagree, and feel that it was perfectly neutral but not shy in tackling the huge issues both political and family.I rather hope there will not be another series, but if Peter Morgan wanted to step back in history rather than forward I'd be up for it.",10
"the power","Im at season 2 and its verry good and rather a little dull, sometimes. the drama of men its not appealing here. the power is the main atraction: how history forces us to do the daily insignificant troubles for us and others, with its passing peaceful moments and such until finally forces us to go down into our eternal forever dark places. i would have refused this crown.",10
"Loved Season 1-3, hesitant about season 4","I am 3 episodes into season 4 and the series lost its glory. I can't even explain it, but the magic is somehow gone. The weirdest thing to me is how much I actually do not like Diana. If you wanted to me feel compassion - it did not work.",9
"Downhill after season 2","With so much technology available, why didn't they just age the characters of season 1/2 into season 3. Changing the cast was a horrible decision and that's why the series doesn't have 9* rating which they would have got for season 1/2. Totally lost interest after season 3 because of casting.",8
"Charles Dance saves this! The story matters more than eye colour","This was braver than I thought it would be but it IS STILL imagined fiction. Only the facts we KNOW to be true can be trusted the rest is all imagined. They weren't as kind this time. And that works more for its possibly being closer to truth. I recall the Queens jubilee as we had to stand in that rain as she she drove by in a powder blue outfit. I know newspapers werent as clear in 1977 but we all had portraits up of the queen and she did indeed age a bit faster as she had no vanity to stop time using much make up or surgery. The actress is FINE, people dont like change. I get it.( Imagine if Amber Heard suddenly became the new Daenerys Targaren! ) People would be....um furiously creating online petitions that no shorunner or casting agent would give two tits about. HOWEVER its a tv show BASED ON REAL PEOPLE who act out their lives WHEN in public.
If it werent for the gossipy nature of people & the press we wouldnt know this much. Go with it or don't. Overall a well done piece of great tv. Get OVER the new cast members and just be glad you got Charles Dance as much as you did. He's worth it! I will watch the next season and the one after THAT. The rest can watch documentary footage which is pretty sleazy by the time Diana gets there....8/10 for not using CGI to at least change their eyecolours...there! I REALLY think they did Anne well! ALSO the mother of Philip is easily the coolest royal I knew of her before so that was great too. This will be news for all the tabloid people. We are better for knowing the people behind the big players. I like the new details provided they are accurate. The rest is just entertainment. But if the royals were just like everyone else then my age old question remains: WHY DO WE NEED THEM THEN?",8
"Is it any wonder that Harry and Meghan wanted out of that whole world?","""The Crown"" has become one of the most renowned shows during the past few years. The series looks at Queen Elizabeth's reign, with each episode containing a micro-story. A lot of things have happened in that family, not all of it pleasant. Many of the awkward situations arise due to old-time rules and traditions about how the monarchy is supposed to do things. There are also servants to do the simplest tasks for the family members! I can see why Harry and Meghan wanted out.Basically, it gives us ample insight into the day-to-day lives of the Windsors and their cohorts. Worth seeing.",7
"They absolutely blew it. Tragic.","I will cut to the chase. The Crown is a well loved series artfully done - for the first two seasons. The third season is a tragic mistake. Olivia Colman is absolutely horrible in this role and to make it worse, she follows someone who was brilliant in it. Equally, Tobias Menzies is without charm or talent in this particular role. There is no chemistry between the two actors/characters and, in fact, it is hard to believe that they are who they are and ever knew each other. Princess Anne is equally horrible. Some of the story is good or okay but more so whenever any of the before-mentioned are not in the script. A scene without any of them is a possibility to hope that it will be all okay; when they enter and open their mouths, there is a jarring reality that the decision makers of this series absolutely blew it by recasting many-to-all of the characters. Poorly done, Season 3. Heart breaking.",2
"Probably the best of all...","Yes, it really is. Of course I'm talking about the shows, movies and even documentaries made about the Royals of UK. I've never seen any other show that could make 20th century UK Royal Family more interesting than this. Characters are perfectly portrayed and the whole show is perfectly shot, the story is perfectly told. Sure not the best series ever but one of the best series ever in its' own category. Anybody can watch this with interest. Just flawless.",10
"Great","Mesmerized by the Claire foy's acting... Top class production quality..",10
"One of the best tv series of all time","This tv serie is about the reign of queen Elizabeth the second and all her challenges. And my god, this tv serie executes everything well. The acting is phenomenal, the cinematography is incredible, the screenplay is fantastic and the story is amazing.This serie is a MUST WATCH.",10
"Love the show as whole.","I love watching anything that has anything to do with history, absolutely obsessed lol. Ok now that I've said that....
I come from a very very long line of people that have worked themselves to bone for everything they have, alot like most of the world. One character (or person) I can't stand is Charles. I pray he's wasn't really like this because he's the biggest winner I've ever seen. I have two children and trust me children wine. This dude takes it to a entirely new level. Not only is he a sniveling worm of a man but to make matters worse he played Poor Diana for a fool. Would say the man but that's giving him too much credit ( maybe that's why he wasn't one of his parents ""favorite children"" as they said; which is Appalling to say the least). (Some of my family worships the group my baby brother walks on because he was the only boy in the family in 30+ years so I refuse to allow favoritism in my house because it can create major issues throughout their lives), ayways....
Not only is he the biggest man children without a spine I've ever seen but he cheated on Diana from day one with that person Camilla. (sorry for being really rude) I can't get over how he went for her of Diana.Diana was an amazing woman flat out and he betrayed her for one of the most unattractive people ever inside and out.",10
"Amazing","Just amazing. Tye characters, the drama, the world of the royals and the external representation of the time period and the politics make The Crown one of Netflix's top shows if not the best!
Splendid work!",10
"Absolutely stunning and emotional","I finally found a show that warms my heart in the best ways. Teaches me history about the Royals, and viewing some fantastic actors that I liked my entire life and some new.",10
"Head tilt","Were they given directions to keep their heads down or to the side? Charles seems to permanently have his head leaning forward, Thatcher permanently has her head turned on an angle, and the same for Diana.",9
"Why?! 😅😅😅😅😅","Recently started into the 3rd season, getting used to the new cast has been a little tricky but once I got into episode 4, it really hit the fan!
The guy playing ""John Armstrong"" is from Northern Ireland, I know what part of the country he's from. But dear god! Don't get a Northern Irish actor to try and do a different Northern Irish accent because that phone call he just did, the accent was done absolutely horrendously! 😂😂😂😂😂",8
"Recasting is ridiculous","I'm literally only on here to comment on how absurd it is to change the entire cast we've grown use to for two seasons!!",8
"Why do the British hate Thatcher?","I wonder whether this program would be so nasty about Thatcher if it wasn't 2020? Didn't Thatcher help the UK recover economically after a long period of slow or negative growth? Wasn't it Thatcher and Reagan who brought the western world back to prosperity? Heaven forbid anyone remember that bit of history correctly. I was so proud of this show for being above petty modern day politics but 2020 has infected every last inch of our entertainment content. It makes my skin crawl when I think about it.",7
"A Struggle to Watch","Not into Season 3, but I'm giving it 2 Stars because of Helena Bonham-Carter and Erin Doherty. Quite frankly, it's the worst season out of the three. I have no idea why people are ranting and raving about how great The Crown is because Season 3 is a struggle to watch. Olivia Colman, with all of her talent, is absolutely unbearable as the Queen. She just can't bring the Queen to life the way Claire Foy did in Seasons 1 and 2. Tobias Menzies as Phillip is like watching a reanimated embalmed corpse. I wish he would stay off the screen, he's cringy. Helena Bonham-Carter in episode 2 was marvelous, but she has so little to do, why is she even in the series? What a waste of talent. Josh O'Connor as Prince Charles is good, but outside of Bonham-Carter, Erin Doherty as Princess Anne is the other bright light in THE most drab, boring vanilla season in this series. It's like watching paint dry. There's so many forgettable characters and episodes, where does one begin. I honestly feel that after this lackluster season, I'm pretty much done with The Crown. The powers-that-be should have simply stayed with the original cast and aged them. Hollywood is full of special effects wizardry, they should have allowed them to work their magic.",2
"Arguably the best web series ever produced to date !!","Charting the personal life and highly publicized reign of British monarch Queen Elizabeth II, THE CROWN traces her rise from a young, newly married royal in 1947 to one of the most recognizable and iconic rulers in the world, carrying out her duties amid a climate of continual social change and political upheaval.Said to be Netflix's most expensive series to date pays off with a beautifully acted and impeccably designed drama that's also one of its very best and not because it's been engineered for prolonged binging. Quite the opposite, as each episode is structured to not necessarily blend into the next but to stand satisfyingly on its own, like an artfully wrapped package that's waiting to be opened when you're ready. It's a novel approach for a streaming television series that makes The Crown and its noticeable lack of cliffhangers feel revolutionary compared to some of its peers.Those looking for an escape, whether from one's daily drudgeries or the uncertainties of modern politics, will likely find The Crown a welcome refuge. But it serves up more than dazzling visual extravagances. It also delivers thoughtful and complex messages about power, corruption, gender, and leadership that, for a period piece, have surprising relevance.Cinematography is precise to the point and doesn't indulge in any unnecessary extravagance.Production design is the best that I have ever seen in my four decade old movie watching experience. Costumes and makeup is on a whole new level, it's very authentic in every way. Music is great especially for the first two seasons when Hans Zimmer was at the helm. Though I only knew about the royal family very vaguely before this series, I believe the screenplay written for this series is one of the best ever written in terms of authenticity and intensity. Stephen Daldry's work is top class. Claire Foy absolutely rocked in the lead role in the first two seasons. Almost every supporting actor & actress have played their part to perfection, with John lithgow as Churchill the best.Overall, The episodes continue to compel one after the next, with varying focus on characters, political events, and unique family drama. Audiences may especially enjoy the portrayal of other well-known figures of the time, such as Billy Graham and the Kennedys. A must watch for everyone who love watching quality content.
Again a must watch just for the excellence in Production Department and acting performances above anything else. 9.5 stars for first season, 9 stars for the second season, 8 stars for the third season and 8.5 for the fourth season. To a total of 8.8 stars out of ten for the first 4 seasons.",9
"casting of Diana............","Diana was shy and awkward, not Autistic. Her head swings and stares, presumably meant to depict shy peeks are more horror film visions. The actress may have the look of Diana, but the hauntingly facial movements of 'Chucky' . So far the entire production, cast and plot has been superb, but this Lady Di is quite comical, hoping it gets better.",8
"The Great Show!","First, I would like to correlate this drama with a movie The King's Speech, it won Oscars. Then comes this drama - simple and elegant, which proves to be almost elaborated sequel of that. I become fan of Peter Morgan who tells us how to present an ordinary real story in an extra-ordinary manner. It shows the real challenges of the young Queen Elizabeth amid the fast changing British society and male chauvinist husband; despite all, she stands firm and finally, the crown wins. People during her rule has advantage of experiencing new form of sovereignty which also redresses parliamentary democracy. All these things are portrayed in the magnificent way. A must watch show for the people who like British English and I have enjoyed it a lot!",10
"From someone who liked season 3 and 4","I've read many many comments complaining about the change of cast, which is as I could conclude, the main reason for disliking season 3 and 4. I've tried watching the s01e01 when it came out, but as someone not familiar at all with the British crown and their history, I found it too hard to follow and gave up immediately. Then they have casted 2 actresses I admire - Olivia Colman and Helena Bonham Carter so I decided to give it a try once again just because of them, hoping that I could understand it better now that Charles and Diana are in the timeline, because that's something I remember as a kid. And I liked it a lot. Cast is tremendous, story well done, I got acquainted with the characters and after finishing season 3 and 4, I've decided to try again with the season 1. And I liked it too, although still a bit less than 3&4. Claire Foy and Vanessa Kirby are also amazing and yes, there's a bit of a change in tone in HBC portrayal but it's not huge and unbelievable. Except Olivia looks older than her age, there were no discrepancies between her and Claire's portrayal of queen Elizabeth. Except eye color, but it's silly to mention or complain about it. I'm looking forward to season 2 and 5 and 6. But I dislike casting Elizabeth Debicki as older Diana, I always found her acting plain, lifeless and (n)one-dimensional. But I hope they know what they're doing, that she wasn't chosen for being slim blonde with slightest physical similarity to Lady Di and that she won't ruin yet another movie/show.",8
"Goof","The four engined bombers flying over London at the start of episode 7 are factually innaccurate because the RAF had no 4 engined bombers in 1940",8
"Shows irrelevancy and arrogance of Royalty.","Great acting, great series. A real inside look at how the Royals live off the working people and spend most of their time whining about it.Charles especially comes off as a boring, snob intent on having an affair with the despicable Parker-Bowles who he finally in real life was able to ruin her marriage and marry her.
The show makes it even more difficult to understand how Britons put up with this outdated mess of a family and tradition.",8
"One of the best series I've ever watched. Yes, even season 3 !","Not much more I can add to the positive than what's already been said by so many others. I started watching this series a year or so ago, but found the first episode kind of boring and stopped watching 1/2 way through. I just restarted it a couple weeks ago and I'm already at the end of season 3. The more I watched, the more hooked I was. Everything about this series is absolutely brilliant, especially the acting.
Season 3. Episode 1- I will admit it took me a few minutes to realize what was going on. Years have gone by, new cast to depict everyone being older. I was not happy about it. I had grown attached to the old cast members. I did not like these new people. I thought I might just stop watching the series, but I forced myself through the episode. I'm so glad I did. Another set of brilliant actors who embody their roles perfectly. In fact, in some ways season 3 is my favorite so far. Most of the episodes feature events/situations which are deeper and more thought provoking than previous seasons. They are showing more of the humanity of each character, both good and bad. It's more emotionally charged in my opinion.
Can't wait for season 4 !!",10
"Run harry and meghan run","How dumb charles was forced to marry someone he doesn't even seem to like and how awful diana was stuck in a middle of such a crap show. How hypocritical of the queen to let Andrew do whatever he wants. Gillian plays the evil maggie thatcher so well it's not boring. Can t believe the Fagan thing actually happened",9
"Loved it...until Season 3","I awaited the premier of Season 3 with baited breath; until I began watching. My disappointment had nothing to do with the complete change in cast. I thought Olivia Coleman, Tobias Menzies and Helena Bonham Carter picked up magnificently where Claire Foy, Matt Smith and Vanessa Kirby left off.
My disappointment was with the stodgy, uninspired scripts. With the exception of episodes 3, 9 and 10, I gritted my teeth and kept watching; just to make sure I wasn't missing anything of great importance.
While I understand the need to portray significant moments in history, I believe the writers missed the mark. I can't speak for all, but this viewer is more interested in the back story of the RF. They skipped over the pregnancy and birth of Prince Edward entirely and picked up the storyline when Andrew and Edward were young boys. They did try to give substance to the relationship between Prince Charles and Princess Anne, which provided some of the more interesting material in Season 3, (Anne's alleged role in the Charles, Camilla and Andrew Parker Bowles relationships).
I also enjoyed watching the interaction between the Queen and PM Harold Wilson. The scene when he disclosed his personal preferences and behaviors vs. those of the public's perception of him as the leader of the Labour Party and how he and the Queen were in similar positions, per se.
While episode 3 was particularly emotional, it took until episodes 9 and 10 to really get moving and be as entertaining and engaging as Seasons 1 and 2 were throughout.
Let's hope Season 4 starts off with a bang before the series loses some of its devoted audience.",7
"S 1&2 fantastic. S3 so so.. S4 dreadful","I really enjoyed the Crown early on. Well researched, written and acted. Series 4 is woeful. Its now become a soap opera. Some of the conversation between Philip and Charles and the Queen and Thatcher are frankly insuktinggly unbelievable. What a shame...",4
"If you like King and Queen stories, YOU HAVE IT HERE !","Great photography, I am amazed with the story and how they've developed all the characters, the costumes, the casting is perfect. Very well storytelling, from the sound design to the details on the props etc. It get us right there with The Crown. This is a real British TV Series, they really had time and money to film this epic narrative of House of Windsor. We can almost call it a masterpiece of a screenplay come alive. Peter Morgan really got the feeling of it and handled with such care. I'm thrilled at some of the historical detail in, King George, Winston Churchill and above all Elizabeth herself. You will really really don't want to miss this British TV Drama Series. Congrats to all crew and the creator.",10
"From a commoner with love","Monarchist propaganda? That's an old wives' tale, altough a part of the audience said it about it... Anyway, the Windsors are portrayed as full of fancies, the Crown is portrayed as sheer circus pageantry, King Edward VIII as a pernicious playboy, the Duke of Edinburgh as a narcissist who gained the love lottery but did not value it sufficiently, Princess Margaret as a populist party girl... Not even Churchill escaped blame, as a senile leader who burns his own portrait painted by Graham Sutherland... And the cast, heavens! Have we ever seen a wax museum reproduced with such perfection and visual 'whims'? Lithgow speaks just like Winston, Northam is Eden as is, Foy - who had already brilliantly performed Little Dorritt and Ann Boleyn - embodies the absolutist mentality including all its Inherent weaknesses. Very seldom we have seen so much opulence - both in form and content. And no less than four fine directors - Martin and Caron, from the Wallander series, Jarrold (from SIlent Witness and Brideshead Revisited), Daldry (from The Hours, Billy Eliot, The Reader)",10
"Superb","Let's set things out clearly here . This is a story not a documentary , no one knows what went on behind those closed doors despite some in the past claiming ""exclusive access"" . Bearing in mind that caveat this is superb drama . It is well cast and well played.The trick they manage to achieve is capturing the spirit , the feel and the emotions of our history . They can't get the intricacies of detailed conversations for reasons mentioned above so that is filled in maybe correctly , maybe not but definitely well intended by the scriptwriters and no impact is lost .There are some absolute stand out moments that are on record as impacting upon the late Queen and shaping further actions . One prime example being the Aberfan episode . The emotions and the story in that episode are as close to the record as can be achieved and cannot fail to move the viewer . That's what dramas like this are about.They have decided there will be no more series of the crown and whilst that's disappointing it's understandable. The final episode is again brilliant drama and a fitting conclusion to the close of this particular era of Elizabethan history .I'm not a carte blanche royalist but this series enthralled me .",10
"PERFECTION.","UPDATE: Season 6 has already knocked it out of the park.Original review:I can't find a single fault with this series.The Crown delicately tells the story of the royal family over the years, and IMHO... it's done to perfection. I knew exactly what I was getting into with regards to the story, and I can't find a single crumb out of place.Everything - the casting, writing, score, screenwriting, set design, cinematography, costumes, direction... etc; it's all just absolutely brilliant.John Lithgow as Churchill? Flawless. Helena Bonham Carter as Margaret? Flawless. Claire Foy as Elizabeth II? Flawless. Olivia Colman filling in after Claire as Elizabeth II? Olivia Colman can do no wrong (she's great in everything) and was also... flawless.Emma Corrin was so spot on as Diana... I found myself in tears, reminiscing.No wonder it's one of Netflix's high-price-tag shows... you can tell every single CENT went in with precision, and it shows.One last thing... the fact that the writers had an entire episode based around Mr. Fagan in season 4 pushed this series into the stratosphere. (Yes, he actually got away with breaking into the palace... TWICE.) AMAZING!!!I can't WAIT for season 5!!!",10
"Gorgeous!","The fotography is astonishing, as long with the screen adaptation. Beautiful music and great performances. Is the best I've watched in the last years.",10
"Brilliant","Amazing acting and direction. Very well made with great attention to detail. Claire Foy is amazing.",9
"Timeline Issue","I had a problem with the timeline. The episode has Margaret Thatcher becoming PM and Charles meeting Diana Spencer in the same episode. Charles met Lady Diana in 1977 while dating Sarah Spencer. They didn't start dating 1979. And Thatcher became PM in 1979. Also. Lord Mountbatten was assassinated in summer 79. And it seems as if Maggie was already PM when he died. I'm being picky about time. But in one hour they covered 1977-1979.",8
"An instant classic.","One of my favorite shows of all time. The execution is near flawless. The acting is inspiring. The dialogue is captivating. The cinematography is spell-bounding. The score invokes the perfect balance of suspense and drama. This show has parallels to HBO's Chernobyl in that it takes unsexy characters and a rather drab or unexciting concept, but turns it into a highly captivating and suspenseful viewing experience that leaves you wanting more. This is a prime example of taking a concept and executing it to near perfection, and that is not an easy thing to do. Streaming platforms are brimful of series and films that were poorly executed, and that leaves us, the viewer, with piles and piles of thrash to sift through, until we find that piece of silver that makes the search worthwhile. The Crown is said piece of silver.",9
"Camilla","I am starting to believe that Camilla is one if not the principal source when writing the last couple of seasons of the show. The way they represent her is careful and I would even say purposefully as a victim in the later seasons. She was privy to all of Charles confidences, had inside knowledge of his marriage to Diana, the portrayal of a naive Diana vs. A betrayed woman, and Camilla's scenes were banal. She's there but not there. I was disappointed with the actress who portrayed the Queen but honestly I don't know if it's because she is forever Dolores Umbridge in my mind and played a despicable character so well. I still think Charles was given a pass and still wasn't given ownership of his mistakes.",7
"Stop watching after season 2","Season 1 & 2 ***** 5 Stars Brilliant Clair Foy Matt Smith absolutely superb. Totally believable & convincing acting. Why spoil a great formula?! Season 3 onwards ** 2 Stars - it is dire. Olivia Coleman & Tobias Menzies are wooden, dull & unconvincing - rubbish directing ; how to ruin a great TV series or what!!!",5
"Amazing","Josh O'Connor and Emma Corrin did.an amazing job in the last season
Without a doubt, one of the best original Netflix series.",10
"The West Wing of the Royal Family","Great show with good acting and everything that makes for a great watchable series. It's of great quality and very much like a series that gets you hooked and doesn't treat you like some dumb idiot for having watched. Just as many have commented it's very much like the West Wing kind of series. It's one to watch and won't disappoint.",10
"Season 3 finishes strongly","Like many others, I found the cast change jarring during the first four or five episodes but found that as I got used to the characters, the later episodes equaled or surpassed the quality of the first 2 seasons.Olivia Coleman by the end proves to be even more deep and sympathetic than Claire Foy, even though I was skeptical at the beginning. Tobias Menzies is perfect throughout and provides a seamless progression from Matt Smith as Phillip. Josh O' Conner and Erin Doherty are fabulous as Prince Charles and Princess Anne.I think the last five or so episodes of Season 3 are probably better than anything in the first two seasons. So, if you're like me, and were nostalgic for the original cast when starting to watch this new season, just stick with it.",9
"Absolutely Compelling","The Crown is television at its most compelling. The lead performances from Claire Foy and Matt Smith in the first two seasons are perfect, and strong performances continue in Season 3. Not every episode is perfect and history is a secondary priority to the show so don't take it as fact. But it paints the picture well, capturing the feel of its subject and telling a great overrall story. Its consistently good to outstanding and well worth a watch.Season 1:
The best of the show so far is in its beginning. The story of how Elizabeth rises to the throne and its first challenges is the most compelling and utterly captivating tv. The wedding opens the series beautifully. The death of the king is moving and packs a punch. The look at Churchill in this season too is great. It's pretty much perfect, particularly those first two episodes.Season 2:
The weakest point of the show but still strong. Season 2 lacks momentum or a sense of strong direction, seeming to bounce around aimlessly. The first season was driven by Elizabeth becoming a queen. The second season builds on what came before but without the same sense of purpose, and certain episodes feel like they're inserted in. The episodes are still strong though and the performances, particularly Claire Foy, are stunning.Season 3:
Season 3 feels like a new start due to the new cast. Tobias Menzies replaced Matt Smith as Philip and fills the role absolutely perfectly. Olivia Colman, taking over from Claire Foy, is a very good Elizabeth but doesn't quite live up to the high standard set by Foy over the last two seasons. She is also hindered by sometimes unsympathetic writing. Charles and Anne also take centre stage now and by the end of the season it looks like Charles could be set to be the new main character.
The season takes a more episodic approach with almost each episode feeling like it could be its own standalone special. The whole thing feels somehow bigger, grander. It's a new feel but it works excellently for the Crown. The portrayal of Harold Wilson, the increfibly moving Aberfan episode, and Prince Charles' journey (particularly in Wales) are the highlights of the season.",8
"Great performances, beautiful cinematography and amazing music, only the line between truth and that added for dramatic effect concerns me","It must be very difficult getting the balance between what is known to be fact and what needs to be added for dramatic effect and to complete the story. I assume huge amounts of research went in to the story and I can only hope that it is as accurate as it can be.However putting this aside I have thought at the episodes have been great with season 3 being by far the best.The cinematography is gorgeous, the script both crisp and funny when required. All the actors have been amazing and I don't really want to praise anyone over another.I was worried this was either going to be a love fest for the royals or sensationalism and over dramatic. I do like the overall idea of the royal family although some of the individuals leave a little to be desired. So I wanted a balanced view and think I got it.I initially assumed it would be a program my mother only would like but found myself drawn in.It appears to give an insight into the pressure and challenges facing the family as it has moved through history. It certainly made me think that even with all that money and property it definitely hasn't guaranteed happiness and I really don't envy them.It is very subtle in making its overall points and I like to think if they ever watched it, whilst they may think ""we that never bloody happened"" they would appreciate the take on their lives.My favourite episodes mostly fall within season 3 with Aberfan being one of the most emotional bits of TV I have ever watched. The last 2 minutes are so well shot and draw you in right until that crucial final second which I think sums up the whole point i make above.As a guy in my 40s trying to find my place in an ever changing world a particularly liked the episode ""moon dust"" and whilst one of the slower episodes it really hit home, and with Prince Philip having retired recently with health concerns it made it even more poignant.If you detest the Royal Family you will probably pick a lot of fault with the program however if you take it as a reflection of a family facing unique challenges it is amazing.",9

NetflixI have left my review until the finale of this excellently produced and written six part series that is an impression of the family and a tribute to a long life of dedication and untiring service that is a legacy to the late and great Queen Elizabeth 11.Peter Morgan the series creator has successfully combined fantasy and reality to create an entertainment not a documentary.The imaginary aspects of Peter Morgan's scripts also applied to his play The Audience ,which was a wonderful insight into the possible interactions between The Queen and 8 of the 15 Prime Ministers that served during her long reign.In 2007 Peter Morgan was nominated for an Oscar for writing the script for the movie The Queen depicting events and imagined interactions that are repeated again in the finale of The Crown when a nation mourned the tragic death of Princess Diana.To say that Peter Morgan's musings on the members of The Windsor family has helped accumulate a huge fortune for Peter Morgan is an understatement .His work on notable projects, including ""The Queen,"" ""Frost/Nixon,"" and ""The Crown,"" has earned him critical acclaim and contributed substantially to his wealth.One of the most significant contributors to Peter Morgan's net worth is the lucrative deal he signed with Netflix in October 2019. While the exact figures of the deal remain undisclosed, it is estimated to be worth at least $100 million.The six series of The Crown featured 3 excellent actresses who successfully portrayed The Queen at different stages of her life . First it was Claire Foy as the young woman who was summoned back to England from an African holiday to mourn her father King George and eventually be crowned monarch in 1953.Olivia Coleman took over from Claire Foy at the time Harold Wilson became Prime Minister in 1964 and remained in the series till 2020 .As much as I admire Olivia Coleman my least favourite series of The Crown was the 21 episodes that she played The Queen not because of her performance she was excellent as usual . I just found her portrayal rather frumpy and a case of poor casting .It was a stretch to far for me to believe that the beautiful woman that Claire Foy depicted in just 11 years would turn into the persona of Olivia Coleman .No offence to Olivia Coleman I felt she wax just miscast because in 1964 the Queen was still a very beautiful woman.My other reason for not enjoying the middle seasons of the Crown was also the miscasting of Helena Bonham Carter who I disliked intensely in her role as Princess Margaret I thought she was downright common which Margaret in public anyway never was .The highlight of that series for me was Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher her scenes made up for any shortcomings I found with the series.If it wasn't for my casting dissatisfaction with series three and four I probably would have given The Crown as a whole a higher rating .On now to series 5 and 6 alongside 1 and 2 my favourite so far I think the casting of Imelda Staunton was inspired she began her reign in The Crown in 1987 when the Royal Yacht was refitted and the marriage breakdown of The Prince and Princess of Wales was becoming public knowledge.Both Olivia Coleman and Imelda Staunton are wonderful actresses however for me Imelda Staunton gives the most authentic and emotionally satisfying portrayal of The Queen as did Claire Foy in series 1and 2 .Both actresses who played Princess Diana were superb Emma Corrin in series 3 and 4 and Aussie actress Elizabeth Debicki in series 5 and 6 gave perfect interpretations of The Princess who longed to become the Queen of Hearts until fate tragically cut short her life on the 31st of August 1997.The final 2 last series of The Crown I found superb with the exception of another slight miscasting choice of Luther Ford as Prince Harry and that's probably because I dislike the actual character in reality.I really enjoyed Ed McVey a complete newcomer making his television debut as Prince William and Meg Bellamy also a relative newcomer as Kate Middleton they were totally believable as they negotiated the days of their early romance and courtship. The scenes where Prince William and his father are experiencing a rift and recriminations after Princess Diana's death were moving .Jonathan Price as Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was outstanding managing to soften the character of the brittle bad tempered husband to the Queen especially when reconciling William and his father after their fallout and resentment that resulted from Diana's death .One of my favourite British actresses is Leslie Manville who I thought gave a superb performance as the Princess Margaret far superior to Helen Bonham Carter who I also admire but not in The Crown series 3&4.Her scenes towards the end of Princess Margaret's life as her health deteriorates and her bond with her sister The Queen are so emotional and touching.Her performance was Emmy worthy as was Imelda Staunton's I'm sure many nominations for the final series will be forthcoming and will add to the 21 Emmy's that the series has received already.The production values costumes set decoration and music provided by the technical wizards help make The Crown so watchable and entertaining.I watched it as an entertainment not as accurate account of events most of the actual events that occurred during the reign of Queen Elizabeth 11 are covered but the conversations and interactions are imaginary as no one really knows what actually took place.The final scenes of series 6 are very moving as the sun is setting on The Queens long reign when she is considering abdicating after her son Prince Charles marries his beloved Camilla .It was a master stroke to reunite all 3 actresses Claire Foy , Olivia Coleman and Imelda Staunton as they appear to the ageing monarch convincing her to continue her life of service to the nation and the Commonwealth .The final pre credits scene depicting the long solitary walk through St George's Chapel Windsor by The Queen , Imelda Staunton who had been in quiet contemplation after imagining her funeral are the most poignant of the series for me . A masterclass of light camera angles without a word of dialogue are stunning and I defy anyone Monarchist or Republican not to be moved at times during the entire series I felt a little voyeuristic and embarrassed for the family but this final series achieved what I think is a tribute to the most dedicated well regarded and enduring Monarch since her namesake Queen Elizabeth 1 was crowned in 1559 I doubt we will see the like of her again.I watched an interview with Imelda Staunton who related before the final scenes were filmed news arrived of the Queens death .It coincided with her 10 days off from filming which happened to be the 10 days of official mourning for the monarch and the last scenes were the most emotional experience for her and the filming crew ..",8
"Well done overall writing and staging. Bravo","We lived through these as many have. We even saw Diana and the entourage up close from years in London. Excellent overall EXCEPT Margaret Thatcher looked like a cartoon character. The only aspect which was right was the hair. Her face and lips were not distorted....even ugly. Google any photos of her and you will see.",8
"Winston Churchill","I gave 10/10 Stars at the start of watching the first season episode 4, only because i saw and knew why Winston Churchill was a great smart leader in his times, i wish if we get a series about this genius leader from his born till his death, england and the free world own this man a lot...",10
"Wonderful Soap Opera; Questionable Truth","Having just completed season 1, I may not continue. My expectation was that The Crown would be historically accurate, but alas it is not.Since other reviewers have commented on numerous historical inaccuracies, I'll only mention two, both in connection with Churchill. Lithgow is not bad, actually quite good in many respects, but he presents a Churchill who can barely stand, and walks only with great difficulty. If you look at newsreels of the day, you see this is not correct and is a bit of overacting by Lithgow, as Churchill was surprisingly robust well into his 80's.Second (spoiler!), after Churchill's official portrait was painted, which he hated, we see him in his garden setting fire to it, with the smiling approval of his wife. In 1978, it was reported that the painting was actually burned by Lady Churchill's private secretary, at the direction of Lady Churchill.I'm not sure what was gained by this perhaps minor rewrite of history, but it undermines my faith in the accuracy of the rest of this otherwise very watchable series, and turns it into something of an historical soap opera.",6
"Lost Interest","Loved series 1and 2. Spent months waiting for series 3. Have viewed the first 5 episodes of the new series and basically lost interest,a view shared by my partner. We cannot identify with some of the new casting. The stories are grey and basically boring. the Investiture and Coup episodes for example.
That's it no more Crown viewing for us",3
"Feeling like family","I love the writing and the characters. Wasn't sure I'd want to watch all the way through. I feel connected now",10
"The Crown","Much has been written since the debut of the Netflix series that charts the life of Queen Elizabeth II about how much creative license is being taken by the creative team at Netflix as far as events and relationships between all the main players.Probably a fair bit, if I'm being honest, to make it more exciting. The broad brush strokes of history are there and this is a drama, not a documentary, so I'm fine with it.That aside, The Crown is brilliantly written and acted, the sets are fantastic, and considering it is largely a slowly-paced drama without any real action sequences - just people talking, often in spectacularly ornate rooms, castles and other abodes - there is often great tension as Elizabeth grapples with decisions that, for better or worse, will affect millions.Brilliant stuff. Amongst the best that Netflix has ever released.",8
"phenomenal all around","The acting in this show is incredible. The costume design is incredible. The sets are incredible. Furthermore, I love that this show took its time and involved many forgotten event that still impacted the royal family. As a foreigner, this was very interesting to me. People often pass on watching The Crown because the ""already know about all that stuff"", when they really only know the smallest details about Princess Di. This show was a great watch for a history lover such as myself, and I enjoyed seeing other figures outside of the royal family and their influence on politics and such.",9
"Good show","It is a pretty good show for someone who is into Royals. Very very nicely executed technically, beautiful sceneries, great acting as well .The attention to historical detail is remarkable; the costumes and settings transport you back in timeThere is some ups and downs , some moments are a bit slow, nothing is happening. Quite a few episodes were not going places I would say. A very good last season, with great acting across the board. The ending, is where it picks up. Last season's a winner, with top-notch performances all around. If you're into royal drama, give it a shot. Will kind of miss it now it is over.",9
"The Royals are not so bad","Season 3 cast were superb, my favorite being Princess Anne that was portrayed well. Absolutely enjoyable, makes one find out the real facts.",8
"See the Queen's life","""The Crown"" is one of the iconic series of our time. This British work perfectly conveys the spirit of monarchical culture, backstage intrigues, and reveals the personal life of many monarchical persons. The series is an advanced and, I admit, an objective look at the past, violating all biases, familiar concepts and ideological preferences.The series tells about the life of Elizabeth II and the British royal family for many years. Here the viewer will meet the responsible approach of the directors to each topic, which is brought to the audience from series to series. The creators have carefully worked out every detail, starting from the script and ending with costumes and decorations.Set against the backdrop of the history of Great Britain, the series shows not only the difficulties of inheriting the throne, but also internal conflicts arising in the royal family and in relations with others. Elizabeth II embodies on the screen the strength, confidence and intelligence necessary to govern the country and preserve the monarchy in opposition to the ever-changing world.Special thanks are due to the performance of actors who gave life to such historical characters as Prince Philip, the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret and Princess Diana. Each actor demonstrated a unique approach to the role, showing the subtle interaction and complex relationships between members of the royal family. All the actors, without exception, are good and have conveyed the real essence of their characters at the highest level. Each of the performers built his own plot and touched upon a great number of problems related to tangible life problems. It is also worth noting the magnificent entourage that was created on the set and the original production, which allowed us to create a very realistic and refined picture.In addition, the structure of the series is unique. Every two seasons, the time period described in the series and the actors who play the leading roles change. This rather unusual format allows not only to demonstrate the art of artists, but also shows the importance of how the whole world changes depending on past events, as well as how the forces of progress are revealed in new forms and circumstances.""Korona"" is a really worthwhile project, an excellent example of historical reconstruction. The project, full of meaning and memories, inspires you to deeply analyze your life and change it for the better. One thing can be said: this is not just the story of monarchs, it is the apotheosis of courage, strength and the ability to create your own way, independent of other people's rules and laws.I would recommend this project to those who are interested in the history of Great Britain, are ready to see the behind-the-scenes intrigues of the royal family, loves deep experiences and wants to learn more about hidden stories that have been inaccessible to ordinary people for decades. Of course, we all understand that this is a work of art and much that the creators show may be fiction. But it's definitely worth seeing.8 out of 10.",8
"Wonderful and enlightening","I love this series and really can't say enough good things about it. Although Helena Bonham Carters eye color doesn't match those of the younger actors the casting is spot on and the way we are taken back and forth through the years only seems to make it better.",10
"Simply Exquisite!!!!","If you're a fan of British TV/cinema you will actually see LOTS of familiar faces. As soon as I saw Eileen Atkins in the credits it was a no-brainer: I MUST WATCH!! Ohhhh and she delivers. We get an intimate, extraordinary, and positively breath-taking look at the mechanics, politics and scandals of the Royal family. The production values are so rich one can easily lose himself in the visuals alone. Fantastic performers and I have only seen Season 1!!! Binge watching a season at a time provides a sense of continuity because of the many and minute details. I have EVERY intention of seeing them all and I hiiiiigly recommend!!!(",10
"Lack of Majesty","Seasons 1&2 were outstanding, brilliant cast and production, script - hugely disappointed in season 3. Wrong cast, extremely boring script ; I thought the whole point of recasting all actors was so they could skip the uneventful periods of time and focus on the more 'interesting' stuff. Also, ms Coleman has completely wrong gestures compared to ms Foy's portrayal of the Queen, which is confusing; she mastered the voice but everything else is done differently, for example the way this Queen smiles and pauses in between sentences is at odds with the previous seasons' Queen. And ms Bonham-Carter's princess Margaret is just awkward to watch after such a witty and graceful portrayal by ms Kirby. Excellent actor playing Prince Charles, though, and the Welsh mining episode was superb.",7
"Speculative Fiction peddled as history","Many of the events are based on real events, but timelines are off - sometimes making events that took place 3 years apart appear simultaneous and connected. Diana goes to NYC in Feb 1989 at the same time Thatcher resigns in Nov 1990 and we see Prince Harry is at a school for 8+ but was born in 1985.
Everything is telegraphed and characters hatch fully formed rather than developed. We know Charles will divorce Diana, but we don't see his relationship with women transform from wanting to be with someone like his mother/sister to hiring the princess of Wales. It's all centered around Camilla even though in reality they had several periods apart.
Princess Margaret is rolled out every decade with some caricature episode that fails to do her justice.
The show does a great job with each decade, some of the actors look like spitting images of who they are playing.
The one real acting failure is Anderson as Thatcher. Anderson is roughly the same age as Thatcher, but they aged her for some odd reason so 1979 Thatcher looks like 1992 Thatcher. She also speaks like she already has dementia.",5
"I am not a fan of the genre...","I am not a fan of the genre and not even interested in the royal family. I have started to watch this series during COVID, just because I have heard many positive comments and my wife was not interested in this one, so I could watch it also during isolation (those were the times ;-). A few episodes into it and I was completely grabbed. Excellent actors and splendid acting, combined with very well though scripts are a perfect combination. There is actually nothings negative that I can think of, apart the fact that the series is ending. I am keeping the last episode unwatched , just becasue I do want to reach the end of this wonderful journey.",10
"Utterly compelling. Game of Thrones minus the gratuitous sex & violence.","I'm gobsmacked by how well executed this series is. Everything about it is exceptional - from the attention to detail, the pace, the story arc. Lithgow, Foy and Smith are quite simply amazing - acting at their finest. How much is said in a mere glance or facial expression is quite astonishing. Thank-you Netflix for showing that you can produce the most compelling show on television without the need for the gratuitous sex and violence.",10

                This is actually several series within one. They changed actors, cinematography and narrative style.Season 6 (episodes 1-4) is unexpectedly dull. Elisabeth Debicki is charming and impeccably embodies Diana. Imelda Staunton is, undoubtedly, a first-class actress. Dominic West also delivers a standout performance. The young actor embodying Prince Harry (Fflyn Edwards) is outstanding - genuine and warmly authentic.However, I find the actor playing Prince William (Rufus Kampa) quite unconvincing. His bizarre head tilting, exaggerated hunching and peculiar vibe give the impression of some autistic spectrum disorder, very far from the young Prince William we all remember. This significantly dampened my overall impression.A particular issue in the sixth (and somewhat in the fifth) season is the racially insensitive portrayal of the Al Fayed family.My favorite season is the second, especially the story of Princess Margaret. Vanessa Kirby is mesmerizing - when she appears on the screen, she captivates you. My favorite episode is 'Beryl' (one of the best depictions of a love story I've seen recently).

"It seems close to real life","Even though the series has some inconsistencies compared to the real reported stories, it seems pretty close to real life. It's very interesting and a bit scary.",8
"TV drama at it's best","Every so often a drama like this comes and blows our mind. The details, costumes, dialogues, accents, locations everything about the crown is astounding. Best British drama ever!!!",10
"The Crown: A Gripping Take on Royalty","Step into the world of royalty where duty and personal struggles intertwine in Netflix's captivating historical drama, The Crown. This meticulously crafted series takes you behind the scenes of the British monarchy, revealing the heart-wrenching sacrifices and triumphs that lie beneath the glamorous façade.Young and inexperienced, Queen Elizabeth II ascends to the throne, embarking on a journey of self-discovery amidst the treacherous waters of palace politics, family relationships, and the weight of an entire nation's expectations. Claire Foy, Olivia Colman, and Imelda Staunton bring the queen to life, portraying her strength, resilience, and the burden of duty that defines her reign.Amidst the grandeur and opulence, The Crown unveils the human side of royalty. We witness the queen's love for her family, her unwavering commitment to her country, and the moments of vulnerability that remind us she's just as human as the rest of us. Through her personal struggles, we gain a deeper understanding of the monarchy and the sacrifices it demands.The series' transition between casts is handled with precision, ensuring that each portrayal of the queen feels authentic and true to the character. While the change in actors may initially take some getting used to, it also allows for fresh perspectives on her journey, reminding us that she's not just a symbol but a complex individual navigating the complexities of life and leadership.Towards the middle of the series, the pacing shifts, giving more focus to character development and personal struggles. While this adds depth and nuance to the narrative, it can feel less action-packed, requiring greater engagement from the viewer. But the series' overall momentum never falters, keeping you hooked till the very end.Despite its minor imperfections, The Crown stands out as a captivating and thought-provoking series that goes beyond the realm of historical drama. It challenges our perceptions of power, privilege, and the human condition, reminding us that even within the gilded walls of Buckingham Palace, the human heart beats strong.With its masterful storytelling, nuanced portrayals, and emotional depth, The Crown deserves an 9/10 rating. It's a series that lingers long after the credits roll, leaving you pondering the weight of duty, the complexities of human relationships, and the enduring power of the human spirit. The Crown: A Gripping Take on Royalty.",9
"If you want to wear it, you must bear its weight;","It is the best historical drama in recent years. It's great. The people in the royal family are also ordinary people. The Queen also has the struggle and growth of ordinary people. She must also balance the royal power and the individual. She also has the father's love and the prince who does not want to stand behind her wife. But the best one is the former king who gave up his throne and became a little sad. And all of this happened in the era when the glory of the British Empire gradually disappeared.",10
"Much better than the Britich critics rate it","The first half deals with Diana'a death I found it much less cativatibg as the second half..Nice wrap-up to an epic series. The critcc reviews seem to have had enough with the treatment of the characters of the monarchy most of which are portrayed quite kindly by exceptional performances from the whole cast. The location sequences are eceptional. The scene in which ER II reviews the parade of toy soldiers lined up on a hall filling model of the
mall for none less than the plan for funeral takes your breath away. Here you have it a country whose economy has been teetering along undidtinguished for half a century reflects visipns of itself in a wired kind of meta glorification of an image of itself that only it can see.",10
"Worth the watch!","Brilliant show and the characters are portrayed excellently. Claire foy Is a brilliant queen Elizabeth. The plot is certainly entertaining and grasps you until the end. A good mix of historical drama and romance . Definitely worth the watch",7
"Crown goes down hill","Slowly went down hill last series 4 acting poor and annoying",3
"Extremely enjoyable!","I think they captured the Queen's likeness very well in this series as well as Prince Phillip and Margaret. Once I started to watch, I couldn't wait for the next episode. It has given me a new love for the Queen of England and her family that I never had before. I think she is beautiful and reminds me a lot of my own grandmother, even when she was young. This series is very well written and the acting by all is very, very good.",10
"Season 3..","While I enjoyed the first 2 seasons very much and, for the most part, season 3, I find the characterization of LBJ to be rather shallow and not really representative of what Johnson was really like. He was sharp, astute, caring, tough. This shows him as a buffoon and he was never a buffoon, never. It's a stereotypical portrayal of a Texan. He was gruff, no doubt, but never like he is shown to be. But other than that, it has still been a well made series.",9
"Make it 8 seasons!","This show is simple outstanding! The writing, directing, cinematography, music and, of course, the acting, are all a masterclass in their field. Not only as a piece of art, but also as a document of a dynasty and a former empire changing drastically, it is a true gem.Seasons 01 to 03 cover the time periods from 1947 to 1977. Thats an average of a decade per season, which makes for the detailed slow-paced storytelling, character developments and insights we all admire this show for.Season 04 picks up the pace a bit, moving from 1979 all the way to 1990. Still, this would make for at least three, with the progressing years until the final season would air, 4 more seasons - but as it seems, the show is sadly only planned to have two (S5 & 6) to wrap it up, spanning much fasted paced more than 30 years from 1991 to the early 20s.The 90s alone offer so much for the royal families storytelling.
Thats a season for one.And then 20+ years for a final season, including William, Charles marriage with his real love Camilla, Harrys emancipation from the family, which in the terms of ""The Crown"" is huge, as finally someone breaks the wheel - and including hopefully Brexit, as a final blow to the UK under Elisabeths reign.And forgive me for saying this: as a piece of art, the show should wrap with the passing of Elisabeth, after all those decades of her incomparable tenure. This tragic event will hopefully be some more years down the road, but even more so important to be part of the full narration.",10
"Magnificent work of art","I have been amazed to the max
First of all is the splendid music had been made, by which our deep feelings have been touched in extraordinary way.Second would be the director work which was truly brilliant
Finally, the acting skills of most leader roles were marvelous and too professional like a realistic life they could bring to us..
Casting also can be added to praising as well as customs and decorations
What i wanna say, i have been astonished by the whole work in virtue of its ability to cast the historical events in non boring decorated detailsThe only criticism could be addressed to the bad fake way it demonstrated our ""Egyptian"" rights to get rid of British occupations and regain our own sovereignty to our whole national land, including Suize canal..Thanks.",9
"Season 1 & 2 & 3 are excellent","Season 1 - Outstanding
Season 2 - Really good
Season 3 - Very good
Season 4 - Many of the episodes lacked the earlier seasons breadth of interest. Partly because, Charles, Andrew, Diana, Margaret, Queen mum, the palace staff, and Thatcher. Although well-acted, are by and large less appealing people than those in earlier seasons.",8
"Best Netflix series so far!","First 4 seasons were fantastic! Great acting and cinematography. Can't wait for the next installment.",8
"Thanks a lot for this show","I am against the institution of the Royal family. However, I believe this amazing drama, goes beyond that. Yes, there is massive poetic licence. Yes, I am sure most of the information was untrue. This is feature series, it's normal! But everything is fantastic. Thanks a lot for this show and thanks and thanks...",10
"Great start but now wandering off","The first and second series of The Crown is an absolute triumph in its casting and story telling of historical events that were to shape the monarchy as we know it today. Claire Foy is second to none as the young Elizabeth and the depiction of those years of the second world war, her marriage and the Churchill years. As we reach the third series Olivia Coleman has now taken the reins and, sadly, although she is a great actress her portrayal of the Queen does not sit well. Helena Bonham Carter is perfect as Princess Margaret. As we have now reached series 4 and the Charles/Diana marriage, and the Margaret Thatcher, years and Gillian Anderson is uncanny in the role but the hair and make up department have given her a hairstyle so wide you could land a jumbo jet on it, Sadly some things have been skipped over and unbelievably, the intruder in the queens bedroom is given one complete episode. The depiction of the relatives who have been hidden away in an institution is again taking up a whole episode and this is proving that series 4 has lost its way from the previous 3. The next series will see a change of cast with Imelda Staunton becoming the queen, and I doubt she like Olivia Coleman will make the role as believable as Claire Foy as the young princess thrust into a role for which was never born for.",8
"Why they changed all cast in season 3???","I loved the first two seasons, they are amazing and the actors are incredibly good! But the 3th season is just sh*! I watched only one episode and I already don't want to watch more! They change all the actors and they don't even look alike! Specially the eyes of the queen and princess margaret! From blues to brown! The eyes of the queen were one of the most iconic things in the first 2 seasons. What the f* is wrong with you people? I am just so disappointed. Even the Queen mother is completely different. Horrible horrible. It was so hard to put some make up on the old actors to make them older? Please... so much attention to the details and in the end is this...
BUUUUH FOR YOU!",7
"Fifth season is disappointing","The first 4 seasons had great casting, but apparently this fifth season's casting is just way off. From the queen, to Prince Charles, to Princess Diana. Great actors and actresses, no doubt, but I believe the casting team could've chosen a much better set to play these prominent roles. The actress for the queen didn't have that tone to which the two previous actresses exuded, the actor that played Prince Charles just didn't quite suit his aura of a man in a miserable marriage, and the actress that played Diana oh my goodness -she's too tall and skinny for the character, and she didn't have that soft playful mysterious vibe that the actual princess showed.",5
"Compulsively watchable","I love it, this series is what you call a piece of art. Over all amazing work by cast and crew. I want to see more!",10
"Obsessed","The writing and acting is so outstanding. It makes the show. The show is full of feeling that's oddly so relatable despite the royal life style. I love everything about the show.",10
"Fantastic Show All Around!!!","I absolutely love this show!!! The dialogue is fantastic, the sets, costumes, acting, and storytelling are all wonderfully done! I loved season 1 and was worried about how season 2 would play since the hype after the first season was so large; but it played out quite well and I was not disappointed. I've recommended this show to many of my friends. This show is up there with Game of Thrones and Black Mirror as one of my favorites of all time. 10/10 would recommend.",9
"Best drama series on Netflix","I have hesitated for years to watch T.C. First, I am not a royalist at all, and second I thought, there would be nothing going on, and the episodes would treat only the yellow press stuff. Now I bow to the makers of the series, especially the creator. The drama has Shakespearean quality. And it´s entertaining. Pip Torrens as Tommy Lascelles is outstanding. Season 3 cast falls a bit short. T. Menzies and O. Colman are good, but the break between season 2 and 3 really hurts. Couldn´t she have been given at least blue eye lenses? And Mr. Menzies appears tiny beside her. Although their acting is great, it just does not cover up the physical gap compared to the first two seasons. However, Josh O. Connor, Erin Doherty and the amazing Helena Bonham Carter make more than up for it, so the hiccup is a minor one.",10
"Fantastic Production with standout performances.","The Crown is an exceptional and captivating historical drama. The series offers an intimate and insightful glimpse into the lives of the British royal family, brilliantly showcasing the trials and tribulations that accompany their extraordinary roles. One of the standout aspects of The Crown is undoubtedly its superb casting, with Claire Foy and Emma Corwin delivering phenomenal performances as Queen Elizabeth II and young Diana, respectively. Claire Foy's portrayal of the young Queen Elizabeth II is nothing short of mesmerizing. Her performance is nuanced and deeply empathetic, capturing the complex and conflicting emotions that Elizabeth must navigate as she ascends to the throne. Foy's commanding presence on screen demands attention, and her ability to convey the immense weight of responsibility that Elizabeth shoulders is truly awe-inspiring. Her portrayal of the Queen is both regal and relatable, making it easy for audiences to connect with her character and understand the immense challenges she faces in her role as a monarch. Emma Corwin's portrayal of young Diana is equally captivating. She masterfully captures the essence of the beloved Princess of Wales, embodying her warmth, charm, and vulnerability. Corwin delivers a performance that is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, as she brings to life the many trials and tribulations that Diana faced during her time as a member of the royal family. Her chemistry with the rest of the cast is undeniable, and her performance is a true testament to her immense talent as an actress. The Crown is not only a triumph in terms of its casting but also in its production values. The series is visually stunning, with breathtaking cinematography and exquisite attention to detail in its period costumes and sets. The storytelling is engaging and thought-provoking, exploring the complex relationships and political machinations that define the lives of the British royal family. In conclusion, The Crown is a must-watch for anyone with an interest in history, the monarchy, or simply exceptional storytelling. Claire Foy and Emma Corwin's standout performances as the Queen and young Diana, respectively, are truly unforgettable, and their portrayals of these iconic figures are sure to leave a lasting impression on audiences for years to come.",8
"Stretches the reality a bit.","I love all the actors, filming etc but they aged people too soon...should have waited for the 70s..
just a little bit longer with The Queen, Margaret etc.",8
"The drama of characters trying to break out of character","Essentially an existentialist drama (pun intended) this is all about identity and Satres ""despair""; the state of not having one. Every member of this entourage has a problem with their assigned roles as extras; as part of the scenery for a royal stage. The core of the drama is thus confined to characters trying to break out of character. Margaret assigning herself a new name, prince Philip demanding a title of his own, his attempts of putting Charles through the same method he himself was subjected to, the old military receipe of the individual reconstricting himself in spite when oppressed - or prince Charles´ response, by seeking to define himself by putting some real serious contents into the title ""prince of Wales"". Now, this is a drama of characters, incessantly trying to not be mere characters, and as such, it is cleverly designed...",8
"A walk through the royal history","The first season was absolutely beautiful. Then it got bit slowed down. Performance, script, research... Every thing has been awesome.",9
"S4 - good but lacking something","Unlike previous seasons this one could have been the most explosive due to the natural storylines from the era but for me this season was lacking something. Having binge watched the season in 2 days I found at least two of the episodes boring didn't add much to the overall story telling. But one thing that absolutely stood out was the amazing acting by Gillian Anderson playing Thatcher. What a brilliant performance! The scene between her and Olivia Coleman when she discovers the Queen has briefed the press about a rift was the scene of the entire show to date!",6
"Pity it didn't get off the fence","The shows sits on the fence between wanting desperately to justify the existence of such an unwarranted privilege in this day and age, and denouncing it. That's why I gave it a 6 and not less, because it does have its moments when it doesn't hesitate from shining some light on the ludicrousness of it all. But it has its pitfalls, trying too hard to make us sympathise with people who've never, ever, known need or want and merely because they were born into the right family. The other massive issue is the change in actors in season 3 - seriously, Lord Snowdon goes from ebony black hair to strawberry blonde, the queen and her sister no longer have blue eyes. It's a bit too much, along with the fact that the respective characters don't much in style and countenance.",3
"Crown's season 5 is messy","The breath of anticipation is over Netflix's hit show the crown finally released its 5th season. Following the royals in the disastrous era of the 90s. Though the show time and time again has offered high equality and captivating stories. All of this falls flat; rather we get a season constructed like a poorly written soap opera with weird dialogues and heavy handed metaphors. It seems Peter Morgen threw out good writing and storytelling for the sake of making season 5 dramatic and spicy. Over emphasizing the disastrous marriage of Charles and Diana leaving little room of other meaningful stories of the royals during the 90s. Though Elizabeth Debiki manages to resurrect the princess of Wales through her accent and mannerisms. The writers instead of presenting Diana trying to find the light in the darkness. They concoct a story of a woman seeking to destroy everything in her path and raise a middle finger to the royals and the institution. In term purposefully giving heartache to her children who are members of the institution. Considering the fact many describe the princess of Wales being a good and caring mother. This writing and depicting seems to throw it all away for Drama ! Previous seasons have managed to balance fiction and reality with storylines and characters. This season seems to want to find cheap ways to make drama rather than following the precedent set by previous seasons.",8
"Binge-able","Another reviewer said this series is binge-able, and that it exactly what I have just done, having joined Netflix for the purpose.
I was three in 1952, so the series covers my lifetime; I know who the characters are or were.
Of course I agree with other reviewers who have remarked on the costumes, settings, cars etc, and those factors are indeed superb. But it's also very sure-footed in the balance between fact and fictionalised events.
Every now and then, I said ""s/he would never have done that"" - as when Philip kisses Elizabeth at the coronation. And of course there are language errors, usually anachronisms such as 'austerity' and 'devastated', but as someone who is always vigilant for those, I have to acknowledge that there are very few. A lot of characters usher someone into a room by saying ""Shall we?"" But these are details.
I usually hate loud music, but here it's very good music, and only rarely intrusive.
The only episode I didn't think much of was the melodrama about Philip's relatives being killed in the plane crash, which was superfluous and went on too long.
But the casting is perfect, and many of them really look like the originals, e.g. Mountbatten and the young Philip.
The recent book about Margaret shows that the portrayal of her here is spot on - and we all knew Tony was bi at the time!
The recreations of contemporary newsreels and TV are perfect too.
It is all simply addictive and wonderful (and we get two looks at Matt Smith's divine naked buttocks).
I can't wait for series 3.",9
"A fly on the wall look at how the other side live.","Having grown up in Australia, with a picture of the Queen adorning the wall in my school hall, and endless coverage of anything royal being shoved down our throats on a daily basis its easy to become dismissive and numb to the barrage, so I went into this show curious but certain it was to be a puff piece.
I am always happy to admit when I'm wrong and with this I missed by a country mile.
The crown is truly a fly on the wall look at how something that never should have evolved came to be, how sliding doors took a beautiful young women and turned her into one of the most enduring icons of the modern era.
The cast of the show are outstanding led by Claire Foy as the monarch and Matt Smith as her ""I didn't sign up for this"" husband, so believable are all and sundry that its easy to forget that your not watching the real thing, John Lithgow's turn as the great Winston Churchill is a career highlight and Vanessa Kirby is excellent as Princess Margret to name but a few.
The curtain has been drawn way back on this series leaving the players all very much naked to the elements and it makes for a damn good escape.
take a leap on this you wont be disappointed .",7
"Excellent History Drama Series","I especially liked the music, the script and the acting of both Elisabeths II.",10
"One lime","Blockbuster production with the heart and soul of prime drama.",10
"Fascinating, irritating and well executed","The CrownI finally finished the final season of the Crown after watching all six for the first time in a quasi-binge over the last month or two. I didn't have to wait between seasons to watch the story develop. Every two seasons, the entire cast changes to reflect the aging characters.This won't be a review of the seasons individually, but more of a complete study. As the characters are real people, there is scrutiny over what is fact and what is fiction. Some of the best episodes in the show featured major historical, easily verifiable events. And the first two seasons, I found, did well in the early post-war years, mostly because I wasn't alive then.The creator of the series clearly has a love hate relationship with the monarchy. And I think it may be more of a love to hate relationship. It's very justified when seeing how clueless, out of touch, pretentious and entitled snobs somehow get to keep their positions and traditions where they're not needed. It cracks me up that Philip, who was pretty much saved from a life of obscurity by marrying Elizabeth, is so obnoxious when he looks down on everyone else for being ""lesser"". Seriously, who else wanted to shoot the Matt Smith version of the character?A big portion of the later seasons, of course, deals with Charles and Diana, and how tumultuous their relationship became. As nobody was there but them, I imagine a lot of their drama was made up, or stitched together from interviews. It was heartbreaking to watch her die again and to watch her children go through a lifetime of pain. It really brought me back to Harry's book ""Spare"", which validated a lot of what we see.I love how almost all of the way the world finds out anything is through newspapers. With the onset of TV, our moronic royals don't want to adjust to the new, and stick with the old. That attitude is why nobody wants them around any more. But since the show ends in the early 2000s, full time news and internet news hadn't really got started yet. Can you imagine waking up every morning to a stack of 5 or 6 newspapers, and that's all you knew?I enjoyed the majority of the show through a historical lens. I enjoyed the acting, especially when they were showing us how pointless all of it is. Their constant justification of ""oh the people want tradition to cheer up"" is insulting and condescending. There was an episode worth bringing up, and that's the one where some of the Queen's Mother's family are in asylums due to mental disorders. It sure explains a lot of the rest of the family, especially since that generation didn't care for those that needed it most.Is it worth 60 hours of your time? Sure, but be prepared to roll your eyes a lot. It makes me happy that the divine right of kings has passed.",9
"Sliding down with season 3 and 4","The first two seasons were fantastic in the cast and in the surroundings like the places and the costuming. Claire Foy as Elizabeth was wonderful and you feel for her. Matt Smith was the personifacition of Philip, Duke of Ediburgh in both looks as mannerism. Vanessa Kirby was an exellent Margaret, she nailed it.But the came season 3 and the change of cast due to the aging of the character in time. But they overdone it. Suddenly they aged about 15 years in a span that took about mere months (season 2 ended with the christening of Prince Edward in 1964) It would have been better to age the original cast.The most striking discrapancies were the actresses that played Elizabeth and Margaret. Olivia Colman made for a too tall and sour brown eyed Elizabeth and Helena Bonham Carter produced a middle aged Margaret with brown eyes. Both Colman and Carter, good actresses, were utterly miscast here.Even Tobias Menzies could not live up to expectations. His Philip was bland and the brown eyes were distracting too.Josh O'Connor was an incredible good Charles, what a perfect casting. He was the revelation of the 3th season So was Corrin who got to play Diana in the 4th season. Gillian Anderson was the ressurection of Margaret Tatcher. The costuming kept the same high level in authenticity. But the aforementioned miscasting made seasons 3 and 4 less enjoyable.Update:
Now that season 5 of The Crown is on Netflix with a new cast, as has become customary, I like to add that Imelda Staunton is well chosen as the elderly Queen, though still as aloof as Olivia Colman portrayed her, Imelda makes her more sympathetic. Jonathan Pryce is a believable Prince Philip, though a bit too old for the timeframe of this season. Debicki is a wonderful Diana, she is absolutley spot on as the more mature Princess of Wales. The only misgiving for me is the actor that plays Charles. He neither looks the part nor has the mannerisms. Josh O'Connor is hard to defeat as he nailed Charles up to his nasal speech.All in all I must say that season 5 is in my opinion better cast than season 3-4. What stays the same in all seasons so far is the great cinematography and setting and costuming.",8
"Very engaging and respectful of historical facts","It took me awhile to get used to this whole new cast, but by the end of the first episode I was very drawn in and engaged. I appreciate that the storyline isn't too slow or rushed. It really nails the personalities of the main characters so well.",8
"Continuity is Key","Powerful, Provocative and Compelling for the first 2 seasons. But if you're a stickler for continuity in time piece saga's like these than season 3 from episode 1 will get under your skin. There just wasn't a smooth transition from a Young Cast to a Middle Aged Cast and that turns me off right away. I fell in Love with Your Majesty, the Queens, conviction to serve as a moral incarnation of righteousness in an era of changing moral within the world, the Commonwealth of Britain and stateside of The U.K. from a very young age. But a creative continuity blunder occurs that no one has commented on between S2 & S3 and a regime of Cast Members changes to suggest a much older era of the Royal Family and it leaves the continuity of that, offset. Claire Foy exits as a mid-late 30's Queen Elizabeth II in Season 2. This places Your Majesties age still in the timeline of Her encounter with the Kennedys, The Passing of former Prime Minister Churchill's passing, and the coming of age of Prince Charles. Enter Olivia Colman at the same point in time in season 3 appearing to be a much older Queen Elizabeth II who appears to be in Her Majesties mid-late 50's almost 60. That's a blunder to me. That's turns me off to the show and I likely will stop watching it and look for a book that entices my imagination to the life of Queen Elizabeth II. Long Live the Queen!",7
"the crown fizzles on season 5","The first 4 seasons were well done, great acting, wonderful photography, and somehow seemed close to some kind of truth, but season 5 is a crashing disappointment, could hardly bear watching most of it. Diana was portrayed as a sniveling middle schooler, full of self pity and little else, her affectations a bit much and over done. Charles and Philip were given much stronger roles, again more caricature than character. The absolutel worse, however, and after a few months since the death of the Queen, the portrayal of her was pathetic, she came across as an indecisive, confused, boring, humorless and befuddled snob, and is quite an insult to the actual woman who carried her role with courage and strength. Showing her fighting with a remote control, fussing over tea and muttering about horse races totally ignored the daily duties she managed without complaint. She was scoffed at by all the men in her life, and never seemed able to make even a simple decision on her own. Her wonderful sense of humor was never shown, and she was really portrayed as a pathetic character. Shame on the director for this entire season of fluff and sad soap opera techniques.",3
"Season 3: Growing older","The first two seasons of the Crown were impeccable and as near perfection as any show can hope to achieve.Season Three brought changes. The changes in actors cannot be just because we are moving forward in time and age. It is possible the deeper significance of this change is that in seasons Three and Four we are being treated to not just older characters but literally different characters. As if the creators of the series actually want us to experience different impressions of each person, presenting us the whole person, in each character through a montage of inter-series expressions of the character using not only different actors but also different aspects of personality.A very ambitious undertaking of an incredibly ambitious and expensive undertaking. And, it works. I think.If there is a problem with season Three, it is that there are so many events to be covered that the timeline moves fast, events are summarized and in some cases skipped. Oh, and the Sixties? What sixties? We get David Bowie's Starman from 1972 but no Sixties and no Beatles (Yes, no Beatles, no Sixties. Did I say nobody is listening to a single Beatles song in England in the Sixties?)Season Three History needs twenty episodes, not ten. And Heath's push into the European Communities and Wilson's referendum, skipped in favor of Margaret's personal life. The scene of Wilson's exit though is exceedingly well done and touching.I would have given seasons One and Two eleven stars but there are only ten to give. I give season Three 9 stars by lending to it the two spare stars left over from my rating of Seasons One and Two. Otherwise I would have but 7 stars to give.",9
"Fascination Royalty","I am a sucker for historical series and films, however, most of these series and films always took place in the distant past (Tudors etc).My country - as many others - WAS a monarchy (a great one) many years ago. Today, it is a democracy and hence - very ordinary. I was never interested in the current monarchies - be it Spain, Japan, Denmark or the UK.Watching the crown however, has sparked an interest I never knew I had for the british monarchy. I was finding myself watching the series on the one screen, and researching facts (and footage) on the other. I even sort of fell in love with the (young) Prince Philip.I do understand that The Crown is fiction, however, watching it makes the royals relatable.Concerning the cast:
Claire Foy is STUNNING. She did a very good job.I love the portrayal of Princess Margaret by Bonham-Carter.Winston Churchill was also very convincing.It is truly a well done series and I will be rewatching it for sure.It was so good in fact, that I signed up to imdb just to write this review.",10
"Astounding","This is the best series yet ! It should be shown in every home !",10
"Drama at its Best","I am a long time follower of imdb.com and have never written a review before. However, The Crown is so amazingly well built production, I could not resist the urge in me to congratulate everyone somehow helped during the making of this production (even I know there is a very low chance for them to see this).
Every scene, every dialogue in this series capture audience. You cannot help but admire the work done with characters, dialogues, dramatizing, costumes, make ups and of course directing and acting.",10
"A Crown on the period dramas!","The success of a series is not just in the way it describes the story that keeps the audience glued but also in the attention to details right from Season 1 Episode 1 to season 3 Episode 10. The superb direction & script has made the audience capable of imagining the day in Queen's life with so much ease. It has nowhere judged the monarchy but presented it in the raw form which is beautiful and pristine.The series has successfully removed the negative bias towards period dramas and created a platform for such concepts to come forth.I specially appreciated the way the character of queen was formed in Season 1 & 2 and imposed itself in Season 3. We saw the queen struggle, learn, laugh, make merry, being kind, without emotions at times and even as a stubborn force. Apart from Queen, the character insights to other members of royal family as well as the various Prime Ministers was profound.On of my personal take away was how a monarchy holds political relationships beyond government, the stability of which benefits the country in the long run.It could have been a well rounded series if more insights of the people against the monarchy was presented to give the audience the other point of view.",8
"Absolutely brilliant","This was very well researched, a lot of money went into this series and it paid off! Amazing acting!",9
"Must watch","I would highly recommend this show for its high quality. Easy to watch and understand some really important historic moments in the world. They don't stay on one certain subject for too long and they show you different times in history. They introduce new characters that play their role well.",9
"Great show","A masterclass and must watch. The ""Private audience"" is my favourite part of the series!",9
"Not sure how to feel about this series!","As all British series, it's very well-made and the actors are great.
But...what about historical accuracy?
A few examples: is it true that prince Phillip was seen drunk at receptions? That he threatened to divorce the Queen because he cold no longer stand having to walk two steps behind her?
And how likely is it that Jackie Kennedy would tell the Queen that she and her husband were high on amphetamines during the dinner at Buckingham Palace, or that president Kennedy got angry with her for upstaging him in Paris and hit her? She was known to be an intensely private person with a lot of dignity so it does not seem like something she'd ever do.
Over the years, I have read a lot of books about the Kennedys, but I've never come cross that information before (about the amphetamines, yes, but not that the president got angry with her in Paris nor about her private audience with the Queen to apologise for things she had said about her and the Buckingham P).
So what I wonder is if that was more for dramatic effect than historical accuracy...?",6
"Season 3 Jumped the Shark","It seems like a totally different program in Season 3 (and I guess it is). I gave up in the middle of the second episode. Too many available good things out there to watch. Episode 1 in the US street scene needed a better period-automobile consultant. The Crown is resting on its laurels.",3
"Vividly stunning","Amazingly well put together with a cast and level of dialogue and tone to revel in",10
"Period drama at its best","The Crown is a real pleasure to watch. A production with such a refined attention to details and with such a perfect cast is almost unique. It is not particularly lavish, but it really succeeds in creating the atmosphere of the time. The characters sounds true, though we all know there is much fiction in the show together with real facts and events, but everything makes a sense. It is not a documentary, it is period drama at its best, beautifully made and really entertaining.",9
"Best show I saw in 2016","Really really love this show, the production, the acting, the scenes, all 10/10. Looking forwards to seeing more seasons!!! I love Queen, she is the only one in the royal family who lives by the tradition and by the ways the god wants the monarch to behave. This is how the God bless the Queen and the country.",10
"A Crowned Jewel Indeed","""The crown"" is truely a transcendent cinematic experience in every department. From the clinically accurate attention to detail, to the mighty fine acting, everything reflects the amount of resources that's been put into this magnificent depiction of a young girl's upbringing as a queen and as a woman.. When I started watching this, I braced myself for a story which revolved around a single character.. Several episodes in, I was immersed in an astounding mixure of characters with enormous depth and color which soon made me realize how cleverly this show was written.. Given the fact that the show is inspired by historic events of a well respected family which has always been in the spotlight, I'd say the portrayal of certain delicate intricacies are handled with extreme caution and sheer brilliance.. The entire cast brings their hearts into the characters and the script maneuvers their talent efficiently so the viewer is focused on everything that's happening, but also in contact with the bigger picture. Also the breathtaking cinematography and picturesque locations are a treat to watch, which adds more icing to an already delicious cake...The way I see it, The Crown is a venture that has taken cinematic artform to new limits with utmost care and due sophistication to the original inspiration, the Royal family and The Queen Elizabeth, the Second..",10
"An excellent work!","A brilliant story of a brilliant queen who understands her weaknesses and tries to become better!That is the difference between smart and idiot people,the first ones know their mistakes so they improve themselves and the world goes forward.Excellent interpretations I love the""young""ones and of course Winston!
In season 3 the""older""version of them is also great even if at first it was peculiar to me the different color of the eyes,how do the Queen's and her sister's eyes turned to brown from blue??do our eyes change colors as we are getting older??:) I guess the director did not want to use contact eye lens in order to have a more natural eye sight.However,the actors are still great and the series educates us we can learn a lot about Britain,the Monarchy and how they managed to remain a symbol living in a changing century",9
"Tobias Menzies as always perfect","I like the layout (just don't consider it as absolute truth), the sound of pure English language formally spoken and I bow in front of Tobias Menzies.Once more ..well ,he is a king of acting and his voice is just divine .Long live this king...",8
"I absolutely adore The Crown","I absolutely adore The Crown. Top production. Every season is getting better and better. Fantastic.",10
"Crown for best drama","The Crown - Neflix's critically acclaimed drama is back for a second season. What can viewers expect fro the second season of the hit show? 
The first season of The Crown starring Claire Foy, as Britain's longest serving monarch was one of the best drama's of the year. Netflix seems to have perfected making dramas. We were impressed with the amount of pain staking research that went into making a show based on a living legend. While the first season dealt with The Queen ascension to her throne & the 1940's to early 50's. The second season deals with major issues concerning The Crown & UK in the late 50's & early 60's. Suez Canal Crisis, trouble in the royal marriage, Princess Margaret's affairs are the story arcs which dominate the second season. Lord Mountbatten makes an appearance in this season & is shown to acknowledge his wife's dalliance with PM Nehru. The episode involving Lord Altrincham is our favorite episode from the second season. It is an episode which will resonate with people across countries, who are passionate about challenging the status quo. President Kennedy & his wife Jacqueline Kennedy make an appearance. Prince Philip continues his philandering outside his marriage & someone close to him pays a hefty price. Although Prince Philip himself works out a neat deal with his wife, post being involved in a scandal. The scenes involving Princess Margaret & her new love interest are very romantic.
The makers of the show have done a splendid job. Just like the first season, the second season too is a delight. The casting, script, direction, set all are perfect. Credit does go to Netflix, for raising the bar for dramas by wholeheartedly backing the show. Netflix has spent a huge amount on the sets, costumes, research & it shows. Netflix truly has ushered in the golden age of television. It is shows like The Crown, Mindhunter, Narcos, House Of Cards to name a few, which make the monthly charges worth every penny. Netflix is the gold standard when it comes to dramas. With such an excellent team of writers, there is nothing that they can do wrong!
Do we need to really spell it out whether we recommend you to watch this show? This show is highly recommended viewing. Not only is the show entertaining, you will end up learning a lot about British history thanks to this show.",10
"If viewed with proper context, can be seen as an indictment of British imperialism","The Netflix drama ""The Crown"" didn't interest me at all at first; I presumed it would be filled with an attitude of fawning praise; a love letter to monarchy and British imperialism. I'll bet some viewers whose worldview isn't based on the challenges facing oppressed, colonized people, whose worldview isn't informed by the struggles of the working class, and colonized working classes, do sadly see it that way; taking away from it what they wish or think is ""true.""But in this drama, which is lavishly produced, the viewer is definitely exposed to the callous, cruel, sociopathic, self-serving, world of British imperialism and the British monarchy.Even taking a highly critical view of the series, one can still very much appreciate the amazing performances of Matt Smith, as a younger Prince Phillip, John LIthgow as Churchill, Gillian Anderson as Thatcher, and so many more (which I may edit to include).There are even episodes which could stand alone as movies themselves, particularly Season 1's ""Assassins,"" Season 3's ""Aberfan"" and ""Moondust,"" and Season 4's ""The Balmoral Test.""It was satisfying to see the tragic circumstances surrounding Diana Spencer's introduction into the family portrayed with (righteously) ominous doom, and in Season 4, if one didn't think this series was sometimes an indictment of the sociopathy of the ruling elite and the monarchy, it's made pretty clear.I'm no fan of the real Churchill, (you can look up his ""dog in a manger"" quote to see a bit about why not), but in ""Assassins"" Lithgow gives an astounding performance, without giving the plot away, the character is developed with complexity and it's pretty poignant.The series also places in context the clashes with the IRA, and doesn't leave out the historical murders of Irish dissidents and the historical struggle for Irish self-determination free from British rule.In fact, ""self-determination"" is revisited in a few episodes, that deal with the Welsh (""Tywysog Cymru"" of Season 3), the Irish (""Gold Stick"" of Season 4), and hinted at re: the African ""colonies"" of the British Empire when Nkruma and others are portrayed (Season 2's ""Dear Mrs. Kennedy"" is one example). It's to be noted that in the episodes dealing with Irish and Welsh self-determination respectively, that context is developed at least somewhat, whereas for the questions of the African colonies of the British Empire, it's not portrayed as passionately, sadly small wonder.A very interesting series, especially when viewed with an informed view of colonialism and imperialism, and the struggles of colonized people to be free.",6
"Series 4...","Series 4 brings this program into more familiar areas for many, and thus to closer scrutiny. I found it to be more caricature than anything else. And the lack of reference to Andrew and Edward in the first few programs is problematic... it's like they don't even exist. Much praise is being heaped on Jillian Anderson's ""Thatcher"", but it is no better or worse than other portrayals....which are becoming too numerous. Nice scenery in the first episodes doesn't compensate for fairly weak script writing (e,g, predictability being the main culprit).
Edit: My rating was 5 stars. Now, after watching all episodes, I revise my rating to 2 stars. Sadly, the caricatures get worse as the season goes on. And implausibility of plot lines grows, as do omissions of verifiable facts (e.g. Margaret Thatcher's fight with the coal miner's union and its consequences). Particularly annoying is the ""stooped"" depiction of Charles: I felt like I was watching a weird mash-up of Mr. Scrooge and the Grinch.",2
"It gets better and better","Something is happening: we are gaining perspective on the 20th century. In movies and documentaries all over now,World War II is gradually becoming romanticised as I am sure the great War once did when The last survivors passed away. Less debate and more contemplation. Like when you stop stiring your drink Because The ice has finally melted into it. The crown is a sort of tour of significant events in the 20th century with Queen Elizabeth and the royal family in its centre. A good choice if you ask me. If instead they had gone for Pope John Paul II or Any president of the United States, this type of show would've been less interesting in its bias.So. My grandmother is big on historical fiction and history all round. We enjoy reading together. But when she said she was enthralled with the crown and that I should watch it, I didn't exactly jump for joy. After all it is she who follows the comings and goings of the Royals on hello magazine. But I must say...And season three is the most poignant. Before, it was just interesting. I cried for those Welsh children. I wished with all my heart I had been alive at the time of the first moon landing and immediately went to ask family members what they were doing on that fateful day.On the episode about Prince Philip's mother, the soundtrack surprised me with some eerie pipe organ sounds That perfectly depict That lady's harsh and unusual life. And that is saying something since we hardly see her again in subsequent episodes. Then there is the low, swooping rumble of male voices when Camilla Parker Bowles and the royal family start plotting against Charles who feels like he has replaced his dead uncle. Well that just made my skin crawl! Congratulations to the composer.Last but not least. Something that Greatly added to my enjoyment of the crown was the audio description by Veronica Hicks. Nuanced, expressive and well paced. Her voice is beautiful and the sexiest I have heard since 13 reasons why. Bravo Verónica! Please keep them coming.
If anyone reading this doesn't know what an audio description is: It's an audio track added on top of the movie or show, describing what is going on for people who have trouble seeing or have their backs turned because they're doing the ironing or something else. I think some audio descriptions try too hard to be neutral or they repeat a characters name too often when it's obvious it's the same person that is performing the action, or they speak too quickly. But this one gets it just right. If you're curious, activate audio description in your audio settings for each item you are watching. Netflix original content usually has them.My grandmother is 82. Queen Elizabeth II is I think 93. I am glad there are still some people systematically retrieving the experiences and memories of the elderly. They don't have to be royalty.",10
"fantastic show!","The only shows i v learn valuable lessons: GoT and The Crown.
You can fallow the logic and understand what character portray in these movies. because its art. these are the modern stories, and other like them, that should be told and they are just like ancients did with Ghilgames and Iliada or Roland etc.fantastic!
dont miss this one!",10
"It's called poetic license...","The main complaint by user reviews are for the historical inaccuracies. Sadly, these reviewers seemed to have come to the wrong party. This is a sumptuous, beautifully filmed vignette of British history. As with most historical dramas, it has to be taken with a grain of salt. If your only requirement is for verbatim interpretation, then perhaps you should confine your choices to the history channel. Otherwise, I recommend you sit back and revel in the subtle nature of this piece. Beneath the trimmings what comes across is the magnitude and the isolation that was thrust upon an (expectedly) unwitting young woman soon to become the sovereign leader of the British Empire. Without any of us having been in attendance, we an only imagine that this transition was no bed of roses for all of concerned. So even if there were gross exaggerations, what (I believe) is true is the tumultuous nature of this transition. That, to me, more so than anything else makes this such an interesting piece. Sit back, relax and enjoy.",10
"Sublime","Every episode of The Crown is like a beautiful piece of theatre that could stand in its own right. The cast is perfection, the script is so intelligent and it looks stunning. It's perfection.I don't know where to start with the cast - Claire Foy and Olivia Colman have both been wonderful as Queen Elizabeth II, as have Matt Smith and Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip. Loved Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher - anyone who thinks her performance is over the top obviously has no experience of Thatcher from the time.Can't wait to see Imelda Staunton and Dominic West in the new series! Bring it on.",9
"Outstanding on so many levels","If only all television could be so watchable.The attention to detail from the brilliant writing, authentic sets & overall design that supported with a superb cast that is just wonderful. How good is the writing? Notice how you go from saying 'poor Charles' in season 3 to 'what a dick' in season 4 and do well to be reminded why he is so unpopular and unliked - even now.So unfortunate that this based on truth and not easily dismissed as unbelievable fiction. And to remember just how young Diana was when she was basically tricked into becoming a human prop for the future king.Shakespeare couldn't have written a more tragic play.",8
"Graceful","I am highly impressed with the show. I am currently on the 7th episode and it has been wonderful to watch. Learning about the royal family this way is beautiful. I am in love with Queen Mary of Teck. I am not very happy about the way the Queen Mother is portrayed though. Comeon, she was England's favorite grandma and there was not much to portray her in good light. Queen Elizabeth II is gracious, smart and also very lucky to have had Winston Churchill. Her husband, HRH Prince Philip was kind of annoying in this series but that's really how he can be though. I know it comes from the best place.",10
"Amazing show","A study of power and vulnerability. Foy and Lithgow are superb.",8
"Season 4 Very Anti-Charles and Royal Family","I absolutely loved the first three seasons of the show as it has been so brilliantly made and cast. However season 4 I have fallen out of love with it. It has become so vehemently anti Royal family, in particularly anti Charles, that I wondered if the writer has changed, but apparently not. It's Diana centric in the extreme making almost pantomime villains out of the rest of the family, and going by reports, is mostly a complete fabrication with little truth.",9
"A genuine achievement","I have just finished this series and I am so impressed that I really have no words. To be perfectly honest, I was not exactly looking forward to watching it, thinking it would be one more BBC-type period drama. The main character was not the most attractive person for a series, I thought. Wrong! You really just need five minutes to fall in love with all the performers. The cinematography is something I had never seen before: the use of CG is perfect and takes the spectators to places we had never seen before from those perspectives, including Buckingham Palace and many other places we think we know but here present new readings. My favourite episodes are 1x07 and 1x09. All the scenes between the queen and her sister are just jaw-dropping.",6
"Season 3 is not as good as the ones before","This season is far less entertaining then season 1 & 2! Very dark and almost depressive. The new cast is good but very stiff and not warm at all. The 'temperature' of the show dropped significantly and makes it sometimes hard to enjoy!",1
"Unforgivabe misrepresentation of central characters","The Crown presents Her Majesty the Queen as imperious, rather than regal. She frequently looks like a snotty, po-faced upper-crust miss, spoilt beyond belief. In life, I don't think that anyone has EVER regarded the Queen in that manner. I suppose that playing a woman who was genuinely beautiful, genuinely regal and had a wonderful quality of deep serenity and composure about her is not an easy ask. But the composure that was present on her 21st birthday, when she made her memorable speech, pledging herself to a life of service for her people, and the extraordinary grace and courage with which she descended from the aeroplane after the death of her father, to greet the waiting dignitaries are the keys to the reality of Elizabeth. This story-teller has not gone for the actuality . He has looked for a dramatic story. He has attempted to ""normalise"" Queen Elizabeth, presumably by trying to imagine how a much less extraordinary young woman might have acted in similar circumstances. He has also tried to imagine how a person of a very different background to Prince Philip might act. Prince Philip was born a Prince. But his uncle, King of Geece, was put off the throne, the family fled and Philip's mother became a nun. Philip was schooled in Scotland where he would have been whipped by the masters or beaten up by the boys if he acted like a smarty. At 15 he entred the Navy, serving through World War II. In 1952 he was Commander of HMS Magpie. When Philip married Elizabeth, he did not visit foreign countries with the attitude of a freshman whose only experience of life is cheeking professors and chatting up girls in the canteen. Philip had already travelled the world, been into battle, seen men die and had led others into dangerous actions. Philip UNDERSTOOD the order of RANK. As midshipman he scrubbed the decks. He knew how the Commander of a ship behaves towards an Admiral of the Fleet. In other words, when Philip married Elizabeth, their was NO QUESTION as to whether he would bow his knee, and offer his allegiance. Paying that homage to his monarch was a given understanding from the moment that he started courting her. 1. When this series shows Philip kneeling resentfully in front of the throne AT HER MOMENT OF MOST NEEDING HIM then this is worse than stupid; it is a cruel denial of all Philip's devotion. What right does the film-maker have to do this?Was Philip REALLY thinking of himself or was he looking at his beloved wife and wondering how he could possibly ease the huge burden of responsibility that landed on her little head with that 4 pound weight of crown?2. Philip is a military man. So here, in this amazingly stupid scene from the series, he is shown with an elderly Kenyan War Veteran, looking at his medals, saying: ""Good God! I've got one of those, and one of those, and one of those!"" Like a child comparing Pokemon. Then he looks at the fourth one, a cross and says ""Good grief! Where did you steal that?"" The wardrobe department researched Philip's medals. They are exactly right. BUT the scriptwriter and director have it wrong, and the actor looks like a total smug ass. WHY?The first three medals are ordinary service medals, with two indicating service in WWII and the third indicating service in the African Campaign. Philip would recognise the medals as easy as you recognise a Coca Cola logo. They would not provoke any verbal comment, beyond a slight acknowledgement from the higher ranking officer (Philip). The fourth medal is a different matter entirely. Every single military person including the Princess, would have noticed the cross on the maroon ribbon protruding from under the string of beads. It would have been more obvious than a blazing diamond in the sunset. That piece of dull metal is the Victoria Cross, the highest award ""FOR VALOUR"". Prince Philip, and all the others, would have looked at it in silence, because that is what you do, when you are confronted by a true hero. The idea that Philip, a Prince, and Naval Commander, would make fun of a man with a Victoria Cross is not just farcical, it is seriously insulting to Prince Philip. For anyone to write this sort of stuff without consideration of how a high-ranking naval officer might act, is reprehensible. I DETEST the fact that this same noble old Prince who has served his Monarch and the people of her Realm tireless, day after day, since the day he entered the Royal Navy at fifteen years of age, until his semi-retirement at 96, can be so misrepresented, at a time when he is so old, and too frail to lay a wreath on the cenotaph for his fallen comrades. Concerning the suggestion of ""oral sex"". Many sexual practices now considered ""normal"" only became so with the publication of books like Alex Comfort's ""Joy of Sex"" 1960. Previously, many people always had sex in missionary position, wore night clothes, never saw their partner's genitals and made love in the dark. They still managed to have fun! It is most unlikely that Pince Philip would keep his wife from an official function in order to perform fellatio. There is no justification for this scene. The people depicted are now nonogenarians. Both are in possession of their wits, and capable of being embarrassed, distressed and angered But they are NOT capable of making an open denial that they are being misrepresented, in the matter of whether they would desert a function to have sex. The writer has indulged his fantasies to an extent which is unfair to the two living persons who are involved. I find this production deeply shaming, and opportunistic.",8
"All actors are impressive except the Queen","Perhaps the Queen is less in the focal point in the first 5 episodes, or perhaps Claire Foy did a too impressive job in the first 2 seasons, while the rest of the cast shines in all way, the Queen of this season doesn't quite stand out as expected.",10
"An unforgettable TV series","A great job by the director and his actors, excellent TV series.Recreates very well the life and reign of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.The filming in its different scenarios is very captivating.",9
"One of the best series I've watched lately on Netflix","The Crown is a compelling series and is one of the best series I've watched lately on Netflix, the cast are doing an amazing job. Gillian Anderson did an amazing job playing Margaret Thatcher, I can definitely see her getting nominated for that role, that was great acting. Emma Corrin also did an amazing job portraying Princess Diana.",9
"You know a show is amazing when it glues you to the screen with no action scenes","I think the greatest testament to this show's quality is the fact that it managed to re-cast 95% of the actors for seasons 3 and 4 and if anything its quality has improved.
Re-casting is often met with scepticism, and even more so when the show has such strong, historically relevant characters as the royal family. But in The Crown, the script is so strong, the scenarios so well thought off and executed, that yet another great set of actors manage to produce an amazing television series.Seasons 1 and 2 were outstanding, but I think season 3 managed to top them off splendidly. Just because of how emotionally involving the episodes are. I wept for the Aberfan disaster. I felt Philip's middle age crisis. The list could go on.
They even manage to make the audience absolutely sympathetic to Prince Charles, feel for him, and he only appears from episode 6 onwards. That is how good this series is.Olivia Colman (the Queen), Tobias Menzies (Phillip), Helena Bonham Carter (Princess Margaret) are absolutely brilliant. And perhaps it was expected of them. But the roles of Prince Charles and Princess Anne are also an example of spot on casting for Josh O'Connor and Erin Doherty. They nail the ask in making them interesting characters and deliver great scenes.I am glad Netflix spared no expense in producing the Crown because every scene looks gorgeous. And it's pretty obvious they went to great lengths to be historically accurate when they have to, and also to give a sense of authenticity (scenes in Wales in S3 are a great example of that).The Crown is the definition of a good drama series. Every episode is very gripping without ever being fast-paced and full of action scenes. It is gripping I imagine because of how well the stories are crafted, and also because of the sheer brilliance of the actors that deliver them.Absolutely a must watch. I keep wondering what is stopping me from giving it a 10 out of 10...",9
"Accurate","I'm a history obsessed guy, and i can say that this series portrayed the British history in the best way. The series shows us that the British royals we see today and think they are so perfect are not so perfect, they are also a bunch of smokers and drunk people.
Another great thing is that this series is so accurate and correct in accordance to the real history, they didn't made up unnecessary drama just for viewers but they showed us the actual face of British royals.
This series also shows that the royals are not relieved from their duties as people say they are. people are saying nowadays that Britain is being run by the government entirely and royals have no role in running the country. this series disproves them entirely.
The series also showed that Queen and Prince Philip are not the ""Power Couple"" and are loved birds, but they had the same marital problems that 'normal people' have.",10
"One of my Favorites!","Breathtaking, intelligent, riveting without even having a real villain half the time, and effectively dramatic. Being an American and not really being a royal family fan, that doesn't stop me from saying that this series is incredibly well done. Even spanning six seasons, The Crown still manages to be entertaining. Perhaps not in the same way as the first two seasons were, because I love Clair Foy as Queen Elizabeth best, still each actress of Elizabeth brings something different to this dramatization of the Queen's reign.Some seasons are better than others, I happen to think that season 3 was pretty boring except for the Aberfan tragedy and the thwarted romance of a young Prince Charles and Camilla. Season 4 was fascinating to see how doomed the marriage was of Prince Charles and Diana even before the famous wedding and at times even though you know the history you still are in trepidation. That is how fantastic all of these actors are.Some people have accused the writers of rehashing history, and as someone who lived through much of Diana's and Charles' martial drama, I can see their point. There were moments I had to fast forward through. However what I love about this series is the humanization they bring to these people. You can also always skip the dramatization of history that you remember. And may I just say that the recreation of certain scenes was so breathtakingly accurate, I had to do a double take.And the casting was phenomenal! Josh O'Connor and Dominic West are a better Prince Charles than the real Prince Charles. I had to do a double take so many times with Elizabeth Debicki, with how uncannily similar to Diana she is. Ed McVeigh and Meg Bellamy are practically dead ringers for college age William and Kate. I was beyond impressed. Seriously, the series deserves all of their rewards and accolades.And the best part is the Crown doesn't need sex and violence to be interesting! They don't need foul language to command attention, they have class all the way. This series should be a giant middle finger to institutions like Hollywood that make it their mission to be as immoral as possible.I honestly hope that we get to see a sequel from Peter Morgan about the earlier history of the royal family someday. I would watch it!",9
"A Very Informative Series to Watch","What I'm about to say might sound a bit odd.Queen Elizabeth II died on September 8. I'd always wondered what is going on in the UK. I mean it has been and still is bewildering for me how constitutional monarchy has survived into the 21st century. To be clear, I have never dismissed it simply as a mistake. I wanted to understand.I see UK as a nation that, time and over, has sought truth and spearheaded many changes that have enlightened our world. When I think about all the great thinkers of the UK I cannot do anything except from having respect. For example, they abolished slavery at a time when it took other nations decades to follow or they helped bringing about the scientific revolution. And I'm not denying or worse endorsing all the wrong that the English imperialism has done to the world. Most of us, one way or another, are descendants of atrocities of the history and we all need to understand and atone for what has been done.I have not read much about how the constitutional monarchy is being defended among intellectuals. But I have heard that there is a wisdom in guarding it and that it is beneficial to have, in addition to legislative, judicial and executive, a ""symbolic"" body of government for checking and balancing.Queen Elizabeth was a traditional, cautious and wise person who did that just right. She basically intimidated 15 prime ministers, believe it or not, from Churchill to Liz Truss.I don't know how well this series is following the actual events but I think it's quite worth watching.",8
"How did The Crown survive The Crown?","Having watched the coronation of King Charles III not long ago, which frankly was shocking in its kitschy religiousness and repeated suggestions that Charles is not only divinely ordained but also bears any resemblance whatsoever to Jesus Christ, I decided to watch The Crown. The coronation ceremony itself seemed incredibly strange and cultlike to me, and now that I have watched the first five seasons of The Crown, I am prepared unequivocally to assert that in fact British monarchy is a cult. The Royals serve absolutely no function and are akin to furniture which no one is allowed to sit in. Or, as Charles the character (played by Dominic West) laments, ""an ornament gathering dust"".What becomes undeniable throughout the course of this lengthy depiction of the British monarchy in the twentieth century is the degree to which all parties involved spend nearly all of their time and energy and talents on preserving the monarchy for the sole purpose of protecting their positions. They care about public opinion only insofar as it might threaten the monarchy itself.In this way, the British monarchy is very similar to the CIA (caustic incompetence agency) in the United States, which spends obscene amounts of resources on justifying its existence and persuading politicians that it should continue to be funded despite having accomplished nothing worthwhile and having directly caused crisis after crisis throughout the second half of the twentieth century.Both institutions, the British monarchy and the CIA, should be abolished.",6
"Is it the acting?","Like most reviewers, I loved the first 2 seasons. I was elated to find out that Olivia Coleman would be the queen. She is a great actress, just not for this role. It's not just Olivia but Helena Bonham Carter and especially Tobias Menzies...just plain bad acting. The 3rd season into the 4th is borderline boring, if not tedious. And then we bring in Emma Corrin, who couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, so to speak"". This series went from can't miss to a boring snoozefest....way to ruin a good thing.",3
"The Crown season 5 - not great anymore..","It is sad to see such a once great show on it's knees, but that exactly what happened to The Crown season 5. It is rumored that the Queen - who was watching the show religiously - asked to see season 5 before it was aired. I do not believe she would have approved of her portray in this season.It seems that the casting for this season has not been as successful.First and foremost, the Queen herself, portrayed by Imelda Staunton was an obvious mistake. Ms Staunton does not give the 'feel' of the Queen as Claire Foy & Olivia Coleman did. Staunton's Queen feels cold, remote and somewhat negative. An absolute casting mistake.But the casting mistakes continues with the Duke of Edinburgh (Jonathan Price) - a faded and weak portray of the actual authoritative and strong present of the Prince Consort, and Prince Charles (Dominic West - never found him to be a good or interesting actor in any role) who seem to be more annoying and strong headed than the usual.The only good casting I can point out is of Princess Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) who manages to truly transfer the vulnerability and emotional complexity of Diana. Debicki is quite fabulous a my 3 stars goes to her.The story line is what it is, but yet again I get the feeling the show - as a TV show - has run out of steam. Sadly.Watch it - but with caution - don't expect to be mesmerized like in the other 4 seasons.",10
"Awesome acting and fun to watch. Spoiler Alert(an error is outlined in props)?","Whether historically accurate or not, my wife and I had enjoyed this series tremendously, the acting of all the main characters especially John Lithgow doing Winston Churchill. To enjoy this movie is saying a lot since I'm not a fan of the royal family at all. One review in this forum found the queen as a brave hero, I did not! In fact I see her as a lonely sad soul who wanted no part of it in the beginning who turned herself into a power hungry figure making everyone else's life a misery. I was disappointed that not once was Canada mentioned. A large country that bent itself backward to serve and entertain the Queen and her family . I did notice one mistake or blooper, the Cardinal (?) at the wedding wore hearing aids not of that time. In fact the behind the ear hearing aids (BTE)s had tiny tubes, one of the recent makes. How do I know. Born in the mid 50's near deaf, I wore hearing aids since 5.",10
"A fly on the wall of history","This peek behind the Buckingham Palace fence, gets beyond the pomp and majesty to reveal human beings. I am a sucker for all things historical presented with high production values and measured, professional acting. The Queen has blown me away. I recall my great aunt and uncle sending food to distant relatives in England in the late 40's and early 50's for their survival. Even as a child, I tried to imagine what kind of life they were leading that contrasted with our surplus (and we were poor). When Elizabeth was crowned, it was one of the first years that we had a television and I watched the entire ritual. I took a picture of screen with my cheap Brownie camera during the procession. I marveled at the majesty of the ceremony. I wanted to be there. This series has fired those memories and, as I recall, accurately. I have now been to England maybe ten times and have each time walked through Hyde or Green Park to Buckingham Palace. I have watched the beautiful changing of the guard, I have walked the stones of Westminster Abbey. I have toured Churchill's wartime offices. I have tried to feel the history these storied places witnessed. When Netflix notified me of The Queen's release, it became must try TV. Now, after four episodes, it has become do not miss TV. The portrayals are so well crafted that I found myself thinking, ""So that's what they were really like."" Knowing that they may not have been, but brilliant actors have rendered them as human beings with all of our glorious flaws. The production is so well staged that soot gets in your nostrils. You can smell the gunpowder when George goes hunting. You feel the weight descending on the young Queen. You are chilled by the judgmental eyes of George's mother -- keeper of the illusion, guardian of power. You feel Phillip's growing anguish over losing his wife to her subjects and the role of Queen. You finally understand the isolation of the Duke of Windsor for his abdication of the thrown for his love of Wallis Simpson. This is not just a TV series, not merely history writ and truths exposed, it is a tapestry that when looked at closely reveals flaws but, at a distance is majestic.",6
"Seemed fairly accurate and clarifies so much","I've never liked Charles and despised his stupid infatuation with Camilla but seeing how off center he was his entire life made that easier to understand. Camilla was the mummy he always wanted and she wasn't any more attractive than his mummy. His ongoing verbal brutality to Diana was his first chance to BE the abuser the way he felt he had been ignored and abused by everyone except his equally ugly sister. Seeing this also clarifies why Harry really IS better off keeping distance. Considering the way their mother was treated Williams complete switch around to being Daddy's minion and letting his relationship with his brother be destroyed by his wife and his father is the one regret I have. Had Diana lived I believe the boys would not have been torn apart by the pettiness of these relics of humanity. Hoping Charles dirty deeds catch up to him before his first year is up.",10
"Mezmerising","I found the series mesmerising and thought provoking. The acting is first class and somehow you feel for all the characters, even though they all have obvious flaws. The authenticity of the characters is what makes it so special. Each cleverly written conversation with the main characters makes you feel as though you were seeing the situation from their shoes. Of course, the wonderful cinematography doesn't hurt either. I found myself entranced with the history and often found it difficult not to read Wikipedia halfway through an episode to know more about a character or situation. I'm torn between the characters and she her I even support a monarchy it really seems like s burden. The media dumps on them so quickly but watching this series you gain an appreciation for the family's commitment and sacrifices. Can't wait for season 2!",10
"Brilliant!","Oh no not another film about the British royal family. After the recently aired ""Victoria"" which was a bit boring and the truly awful ""The Tudors"" my expectations were not high. But I'm pleased to say I was wrong. The series is brilliant, Claire Foy who plays Elizabeth II is perfect and has the voice down to a tee. Matt Smith is also excellent as the Duke of Edinburgh. The story centers around the queen and her family but it is also the story of Britain in the 20th century and the major events that surrounded it. The budget for the series was around 100 million pounds which is enormous even by today's standards,but it was money well spent and every shot looks authentic and real. A brilliant supporting cast, really well acted plus a wonderful script means I can't really fault this wonderful series. Only ""Wolf Hall"" comes close.",10
"The rating is for the first two seasons otherwise it will be 4!!!!","Why on earth the changed the actors!!!
I have tremendous respect for Colman and Carter both equally, but it is so disappointing the change from Foy and Kirby!!!
Season 3 is a new series!
Foy was amazing as the queen instead of Colman who is so wrong for this part!
And what about the eyes???
It will be so much better if they aged the original cast!!!
Because of the first two seasons I kept the 9
(Rating)!
So disappointed it was a great series but after season 2 it's like 0!!!",9
"Ground Breaking","Without a doubt Netflix have excelled themselves with this part . It can be taken for granted so easily the quality of the photography and screenplay as the storyline is so gripping .Very useful in following the line of history of the key characters to show how and why they came there. Many of us had surely lived through these years but pulling the events together in a cohesive way was many times better than scattered memories of sensational news items we had followed at the time .Many lessons indeed for politicians today. Finally whatever you might have felt of any of the characters the Queen always shined through.",10
"Save Claire Foy","What a wonderful show. What a wonderful actress as QE II, and what wonderful character studies and vignettes. The production values and special effects are remarkable for television (all those early 1950s airliners!) and in many ways the episodes are just heartbreaking. The principal actress around whom all this swirls is Ms Foy, and she should be playing this role for as long as her little heart desires--I've read that actors will be ""aging out,"" but if they can recreate BOAC airplanes and make John Lithgow look 5' 6"" they can certainly make Ms Foy ""age in place"" if she wants the job.Here come the spoilers, and to my mind the highlights: The episode ""Knowledge is Power"" with QE II realizing that her Oxbridge tutor left out a few bits in educating her, but then hauling out her copybook to read Salisbury and Churchill the Riot Act for deceiving her was stirring and a tour de force of acting fireworks with Ms Foy never even raising her voice.And the pathetic dignity and courage Ms Foy demonstrates after Phillip pushes her buttons once too often with his self-centered whining and she chases him out of the villa only to discover that the cameramen were watching. If we only still had men of sufficient character and compassion to do what that cameraman did.For another character study and another view of P-1 and P-2, watch ""A Royal Night Out."" I love them both, which probably gives you a fair idea of my own bizarre tastes. Pay particular attention to P-2 and the proprietor of the ""Knocking Shop."" Absolutely hilarious.",8
"Bad Casting in Season 3","Oh my! Who is responsible for changing the actors to portray a older version of the characters of The Crown? Why not keep the same actors and allow amazing make-up professionals to age them? I am particularly disturbed by Margaret being portrayed by the short, stout and startling Helena Bonham Carter. One of the worst casting decisions in recent cinema. It's so distracting that it is almost more than I can stand. Olivia Coleman is a fine actress but her voice is squawky and munchkin-like in comparison to Clare Foy's soft, engaging Elizabeth. Foy is missed!",6
"Most boring season of all","Although I adore Britain, and anything English especially films, theatre etc.. this production of the Crown was quite boring. I admired Prime Minister Thatcher, Netflix obviously loathed her, as represented by her portrayal by Gillian Anderson, who makes her character appear more of a Shakespearean hag, then the exceptionally brilliant political figure she was. This season would have been more entertaining and interesting if the focus was on Princess Diana, for she was really the star of that moment in time.
That being said, as an American, I have never understood the love and tolerance of the British people for the monarchs today, and how they allow the Monarchs to keep their vast wealth and fortune when so many British folk struggle day to day, like our own middle class.",5
"Perhaps the finest television ever","That's a bold statement, I recognize. I've watched every episode of season 1 and 2 five times at least, and I've watched through season 3 twice now. With each watching I find another level of subtlety I'd missed before. The writing, the acting, and the directing are nearly flawless.It's a shame more television -- and movies, for that matter -- can't be more like this. They take the time to develop characters; they pace the show to let the drama build and permeate; they don't resort to cheap-thrill mechanisms to spice things up.10 stars is the highest rating I can give, but it feels like I'm selling the show short by giving it only that rating.",8
"after watching all the 5 seasons","I love the show, i think all the actors who played the queen were amazing and did them best! Same as Diana, but in season 5 who played Charls is diffrent and i didn't like it that much, but the story and the drama and to know what happened behind is so amazing and curious! I enjoyed this show and i know not all the things on the show are real, but as someone who did not grow in UK and did not have a royalty family i had so much fun to see and learn how country deal with this and how the family deal with the country. I can't wait for season 6 and i hope it'll be better& intresting than season 5.",10
"Excellence","When the story gets dark, you will notice a smirking, evilly grinning face staring back at you. That's you, sitting there in your chair, rubbing your hands together, reveling in the slowly unfolding misfortune of the royal family.",10
"Tour de Force performances from the female actors","The female actors in the first four series are outstanding and simply brilliant. Claire Foy delivers an impeccable performance as the young Queen Elizabeth II and captivates the viewer. Olivia Coleman, Helena Bonham Carter, and Elizabeth Debicki are fantastic in their roles of Elizabeth II, Princess Margaret, and Lady Diana, respectively. Bonham Carter provides an empathetic window into the life of the queen's sister that is truly remarkable. Peter Morgan has a stunning talent as a writer, and John Lithgow shows his great range in an impressive performance of Winston Churchill. The most impressive and noteworthy performance comes from Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher - her performance is extraordinary.",9
"The Glamour Girls","SEASON FOUR: DIANAActress Emma Corrin looks the very image of a young Diana! Not quite as tall, but uncannily alike. The sapphire blue eyes, the same shy, pretty, smile. The smile that lit up the front pages of every newspaper and magazine. Diana was like honey to the bees, attracting men, women, and children alike. I remember how one day, our lecturer stopped suddenly, and the whole class ran outside to catch a glimpse of the Princess as she drove past our University. She also very cleverly attracted donations to over 100 charities which she supported, especially those for children.Her empathy for others and her eating disorders stemmed from an unhappy childhood, spent hugging her crying baby brother in the nursery, after their Mother had ran away. Complicated by a marriage to a Prince with a Mistress, Diana beneath the glamorous facade was a distressed and lonely Princess. As her brother Charles Spencer said in a tribute to Diana, ""(my sister) the unique, the complex, the extraordinary and irreplaceable Diana whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be extinguished from our minds.""Now that image has been captured by Emma Corrin on Netflix, for generations to watch and wonder. And sadly miss.SEASONS 1 & 2: PRINCESS ELIZABETH & MARGARETBoth the darlings of the media in the 1950's, one lived in the safe lane of the Royal Mall, the other in the fast lane of public adoration and parties. Elizabeth and Margaret, glamorous, young and beautiful, were no ordinary girls but Princesses, one of whom was destined to become Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth of Great Britain.This series is delightful and entertaining as it reveals the past lives of the two Princesses. Back in the 1940-50's, there was little television coverage and many of the scenes had to be enacted out. The Queen (Claire Foyle) in her younger days was fun, romantic and glamorous, wearing figure revealing dresses (yes, she did, really) as she dated and then later married the golden boy from Greece, Prince Philip (Matt Smith). The pair was like Diana and Prince Charles in the 1980's, adored by the British public and worldwide fans wherever they went.They were only outshone by Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby), who was less reserved and more outspoken. Musically talented, singing, dancing and attending galas in her hey days, Margaret was also a heavy drinker and smoker. She was later made to behave and break off her relationship with a married Peter Townsend. Scandals of that sort were swept under the royal carpet. Sadly forgotten stories, remembered only by our grandparents as the Queen is now in her 90's (and a sad widow), this series is an exciting time travel into the Princesses glamorous past. Brilliantly acted out, both Claire Foyle and Vanessa Kirby had many awards wins and nominations.Almost like a docudrama. Facts based. As for the script, was the dialogue verbatim i.e. Did their Royal Highnesses actually say what they said in this TV series or did Peter Morgan make up some of the dialogue? Apparently, HM the Queen likes this series, so it must had been true-ish.",9
"OUTSTANDING","The Crown is a remarkable show and you can tell that Netflix pulled out all the stops to make this show seem majestic and life-like. Claire Foy's acting is fascinating and she depicts the Queen as an actual human being who has emotions. All around even though it starts out slow, The Crown is a must watch.",8
"Visual treat and ironclad acting","Season 4 on this beautiful again satisfies. The DOP, the locations, the sets, the casting, acting it's just marvelous. The hardwork of each and every cast member and the whole team reaches us. And the resemblance of the characters in uncanny. When you go and watch the old interviews of royal family members, you will notice the resemblance. All and all both the whole the series keeps us gripped.",10
"Best show","This has got to be my favorite show of all time. The drama, the history, the fashion. This is an amazingly well done show. I cannot wait for season 3 BRING IT ON!!!",10
"Claire Foy for the win","Beautiful series! Absolutely loved Claire Foy, she played the queen incredibly and could tell a story with just her expressions. Wish she had stayed throughout.",7
"First 2 seasons yes, after that NO","The first two seasons with Claire Foy were awesome. After that the production is trying too hard. It's become a boring soap opera. Let me say that Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher is absolutely horrible. Her makeup and wig don't look real. The acting is forced and looks like a Saturday Night Live sketch. Anderson is probably more focused on getting the British accent right than on acting. Really bad. The character of Prince Charles is like a complete dork with 0 personality. If it wasn't for the first 2 seasons I would have given it 1 star. I believe the high rating here is mainly for the first seasons as well.",10
"A MASTERPIECE DISGUISED BY A TRUE STORY!","I don't love, nor do I hate the idea of monarchy. I have a neutral stance on the matter and leave that decision to the people of the land.However, I must say that I absolutely adore The Crown. It's a masterpiece disguised by a true story!It's clear that Netflix and Sony spared no expense in the later seasons and it really shows in the final product although I must say my favorite seasons were the earlier ones with the original cast. I do believe it was possible to film all the seasons with just one cast and a good makeup artist. As viewers, We easily get attached to only the best actors.The presentation was nothing short of spectacular. To the millions who were lucky enough to get a glimpse of this work of art and to those who helped make the story come to life. Hats off to you all!",10
"Season 3 episode 6","Excellent viewing but the end of the programme showed Prince Charles visiting his tutor at home and in the background was a Ford Granada estate which wasn't around in 1969 as the car wasn't released until 1972 which was 3 years later.",10
"Story of sacrifices by Royals","All actors in their characters did justice to the great story 'The Crown'",10
"Altogether, A Triumph","On my second go-round of Season Two, it's particular looks and lines that jump out at me. My favorite arrived in episode five, ""Marionettes."" When Prince Philip inquires about her hair stylist's name, Princess Margaret searches her memory and recalls, ""Vidal Baboon?""",9
"Helena Bonham Carter is EPIC period.","She portrays this complex character with such depth.Hands down the best character of the show and quite possibly the royal family.So moving, so real - unapologetically human
She reminds me the red heart queen of alice in wonderland not because she was in the tim burton remake. But because she radiates that troubled but sensitive persona.",10
"Wow great 4th Season","Great cast superb acting just watched all 10 episodes. A sad story.",10
"Love It!","So, I have to admit that I watched The Crown backwards. I actually started with Season 4 and then watched Season 3. I loved every second of 3 and 4. I loved the entire cast. They were fantastic. The acting was incredible. At that point I knew I had to go back to the beginning and watch 1 and 2. I knew all about the cast change so it wasn't a shock to me. The first two seasons were just as amazing, incredible and enjoyable for me. I just can't wait for 5 and 6 to see how wonderful the actors will be who finish up this epic series.",10
"worth the watch","Everything about the show is awesome n excellent... the actors' performance were per excellence.. looking forward for season 5",10
"Can't help but missing first 2 seasons","I am almost done with season 3 but still can't get used to the new cast. Don't get it what went wrong within the cast after season 2 but this is quite unfortunate. It the season 1 and 2 would not have included amazing casts, I would love better season 3. Screwed.",7
"The final season is a disappointment","What is this?! An entire season full or speculations, only with imaginary private dialogs between two peoples. I don't believe anything from the plot and I am trying to guess how much money did The Crown receive from the monarchy to make this. The story presented here is very far away from the documented reality, begining with the relationship between Diana and Dodo, the relationship of Dodo with his father and ending with their death. Anyway, the plot is boring, trying to catch too many details in small imaginary things, that seem to never end. What a shame for the first seasons and for princess Diana, for me it was a huge disappointment.",3
"Amazed!!","I can honestly say that I was never a history buff. I always found it devastating to learn with all the wars and violence learned in school about how our country became. I'm proud and thankful for the sacrifices made but could never get passed how wars were a way of territory..
I started watching The Crown because some women I know from work really enjoyed it. I figured I would watch to see what they hype was with them and to be able to join in conversations about the show. I have watched the first 3 episodes and I am hooked. Binge watching and can't wait for Season 3 to be released.",10
"Pleased viewer","When I tell you I loved this show from the first episode to the end , I mean what I say!!! It was awesome!!!! Even tho it was based off true events it still fiction but I loved it ..... I've already started watching it for the second time !!",10
"Must watch","Everything is perfect in the first two seasons. I would like to see what they will bring up in the season 3.",10
"Excellent series shows how unnecessary monarchy is","Well, I am just finishing the second season and the serie is fascinating and extremely well made. I constantly learn new things about our recent history, or come across some I've long forgotten, or getting a better perspective. Thats valuable.But I also learn, so far and if the series is really accurate with the royals life, that as it seems, the whole monarchy is an absolute empty theatre, a circus of traditions and ceremonies who has absolutely no relevance for history or country. As it looks, it is pure entertainment for the masses and nothing more. And any attempt for secrecy about what happens behind the castles walls, only further plays into the game of press and public searching for sensations.Sure, we need democracy and not an acting monarchy. But if a country decides to let the tradition of royalty live on as some kind of show, then there is no need to make it cost billions. One palace, one family line and a few servants would be enough.",10
"Absolutely love this series","I can't get enough of this series I absolutely love it and have from the first season. Love the history and how the story of the English royal family is being told. Between sets and cast just amazing.From the cast, going through the years of Queen Elizabeth II and her family and the history.Just wow! Very well done.Starting with her father as King and then sadly due to his death Queen Elizabeth II.All the other family dramas, Andrew and Sarah, the Queen's sister Marget, The war of the Waleses.The cast and crew and everyone involved in this series should be very proud.Can't wait for season 6...patiently waiting.",9
"Good but alot of fiction","This is no biography or History in my opinion especially after season 4,because the government wouldn't ask Netflix to put fiction.First there is too many things they can never know unless the Queen told them!!!And the way that they show the queen was always busy solving emotional problem when there was a critical problem with the country , cheap try from a man world to weaken women.Shingeki no kyojin (2013)Season 1,2 were amazing , season 3 not so good and 4 was great but I HATE how they showed Diana as a cheater and anorexic , and the actress that they picked disaster she was really bad .And i get why the British government wants Netflix to put that this is fiction",8
"Seasons one through four excellent, 5 not so much.","We truly loved seasons one through four, but found season five to be lackluster. They should of just stopped after season four. Season five: lackluster cast, lackluster storyline, lackluster production, you name it just lackluster. We weren't going to even watch after the first episode, but we soldiered through. Although; we like the actor who played King Charles he was not right for this part. We really had a major disconnect with the actress playing Princess Diana and that's about as nice as we can put it. In fact to be honest we also did not care for the way they portrayed princess Diana as: cold, and lacking in intelligence. The world loved Princess Diana, funny how they've forgotten this in season five. We wonder if it's because of who is actually king now. We assume there might be some brown nosing going on. Don't believe we will be watching season six. Thank you for reading this review we hope you liked it.",8
"After 3 episodes - disappointed","I have just started watching this series with my wife. With these sort of things you often wonder how much is fact or fiction dressed up to misrepresent the truth. It is clearly well put together however I feel very disappointed by the way they misrepresent the queen's heritage. In particular her Grand mother, Queen Mary. She is portrayed as an English woman, when in fact she spoke English poorly with a thick German accent.She played a big role in preparing the queen for her role which is so far not shown.However I am enjoying it. It does allow one to reflect on an important part of British history.",8
"All good till ""Greek"" language appears","All good in a very nice and well structured series. All well till the 1967 period in Athens Greece.Really? What kind of morons do you think Greeks and Cypriots are? The Greek spoken in the series, are neither Greek nor Greek-Cypriot. The actor DOES NOT DELIVER neither the language nor any particular dialect. For such a nice series like the Crown this is unacceptable and cheap very cheap!",7
"So SLOOOOOOW","Oh my, could only manage two episodes. It is slow and tedious.",4
"Undeniable chemistry","I try to stay away from TV shows and reluctantly watched the first episode of The Crown. But!!! My oh my, what a surprise. Everyone, I mean every single person has stage-like mesmerizing voice, sound mixing is incredible, episodes are very well put. I can only speak about first two season: Claire Foy and Matt Smith have an undeniable chemistry that is so rare these days. It elevates the quality of the show by 1000%. If you have prejudice, like me, just watch it.",10
"A show about awful people","This show reminds me of The West Wing, only without the endearing characters, brilliant writing and fascinating plots. I slogged through the first three seasons of The Crown, although I was sorely tempted to quit after the first.I found nothing likable in the cast of totally unsympathetic, egotistical characters. What terrible people they are! They range from pathetic and lame to mean and nasty. The viciousness horrified me. There's nothing redeeming here. No one that I would want to have in my life.I admit I may be at a disadvantage in that being in the U.S., I know nothing of the background and personalities involved that, granted, many people who watched this series may have been intimately familiar with. I've never been someone interested in the modern royals, and other than the tragedy surrounding Diana, know very little about them. Before watching this show, I could have probably told you more about Elizabeth I than Elizabeth II, and more about Henry V than Charles, Prince of Wales.A result of that is I had a bit of trouble keeping many of the characters straight and understanding exactly who they were and how they fit into the environment. But, really... it didn't matter all that much because they are all variations on the theme of totally abysmal human beings. Why the royals have been allowed to persist is amazing to me. Maybe the people of the U.K. are just ever hopeful a decent one will pop up to the top and be a proper, compassionate, generous leader.This is not to say there aren't a few good stories in the long line of mostly depressing episodes. I found the story of when Charles (poor, pathetic Charles!) is sent to Aberystwyth interesting. As was the story of Princess Alice of Greece (who may be the most sympathetic character of the lot). Perhaps my favorite episode is the one about Lord Altrincham -- a truly fascinating incident that I had been unaware of. All of these are stories of historical interest, and I suspect that is what attracted me to them.There's a scene in one of the later episodes where Elizabeth II admits that there is something wrong with her, psychologically. Indeed. And in fact, there seems to be something wrong with most of them. They all sort of make me involuntarily shudder: Philip, Margaret, (the horrid) Lascelles, the Queen Mother, Mountbatten, Queen Mary, David (traitor!), and so on. They are character studies in self-pity, apathy, and narcissism. The show even made me dislike Churchill, who'd I never had reason to dislike before.It's quite possible this show is beautifully produced and wonderfully acted. But if so, the dreadful characters got in the way of my enjoying that.I'm not sure who would enjoy watching this series. Maybe fans of shows about ""palace intrigue"" like Downton and Upstairs/Downstairs. I've never seen either of those. I had thought this would be more about history than about the unpleasant personalities.Just a final comment that all the smoking made me claustrophobic and twitchy. How dreadful to have had to put up with that.Series 4 update: Still a show about terrible people doing terrible things. Every single one of them a waste of oxygen. But like series 3 there is an interesting episode (Fagan) about an event I was not aware of, and another interesting episode about how these horrid people secretly institutionalized several family members rather than allow their disabilities to be made public. Even Diana is unsympathetic and the best part of the ten episodes was the rat that runs across the floor in the palace.",9
"Season 5 is Good","I'm not sure why all the criticism of season 5 - there's not much in it that we haven't already heard many times over. I thought it was quite good if taken as a separate series from the previous seasons. The only thing that was a revelation was (finally) a suggestion that MI 5/6 may have been spying on Princess Diana years prior to her divorce - and all the other assertions that accompany such a possibility.Elizabeth Debicki was amazing - I couldn't picture it at first, but she is by far the most believable Diana on screen. Dominic West is a strange choice for Prince Charles, but he pulls it off. Interestingly, across all the seasons, the most compelling scenes and episodes continue to be the ones that focus on Prince Philip. They contain the deepest character analysis. Episode 6 is the strongest one, IMO, of the season, which did not disappoint - contrary to all the bruhaha in the media.",10
"The Crown is an excellent surprise","Not knowing much of the history that went into the story behind the Crown since it circumvents WWII and occurred before I was alive I was surprised at how good I found the shows first season. Great drama, cinematography, character development, and throwing in some history and education on how the royal family worked with the government all go into making the show an excellent work. The writing and acting are great, the story chosen well building steadily causing me to watch it in a two day marathon stream when I didn't even expect to be interested. Goes to show that a good show can win over a skeptical viewer when done well. I would say it was done exceptionally well and is well worth watching and expect to continue doing so in the seasons that are yet to come. Netflix produces another winner.",8
"Camilla","Camilla, in no way shape or form looks anything like Emerald Fennell. Couldn't they find a dumpier, uglier, frumpier actress? And why a queen and her sister Margaret both with brown eyes instead of blue? Couldn't they wear contacts?",9
"Cast and equipment","Great cast and a perfect equipment in every detail.",8
"Felt Bad For The Queen -Spolier Alert-","I just finished the first season of The Crown and I really enjoyed it. It dragged on a bit in the middle BUT still really interesting to learn about the Royal family and their lives. I am a huge fan of Matt Smith so I really only watched it for him. He was really good at Prince Philip. I felt really bad for the Queen to be honest. I mean she has the whole world on her shoulders and her husband only thinks of himself. I mean he knew what he was in store for when he met her and married her. If you've seen the show then you know what I'm talking about. Episode 5 when Philip tells the Queen before her coronation that she only cares about her people and looking good for the public then being with her husband who wants her to have his name but she has to have the people's name. It's a bit confusing, you have to watch the show to understand BUT I felt that Philip was being too hard on her. I don't want to read any further stuff on the royal family because I want to know what happens in the show BUT I think Philip is having an affair. I don't know he seems really determined to leave his wife and be with the ""boys"" mmm-hmm I'm sure those boys have boobs. lol The whole thing with Churchill and his vanity of him getting older and that painter was a bit boring. The part where he's talking about his daughter and the pond was sweet but a whole show about a painter painting his picture for his 80th birthday...umm that could have been done in 20 minutes not a whole hour. And at the end of the show the painting got burnt so what was the point of that? And the whole thing about Princess Margeant wanting to get married to that guy who was divorced...umm what was the big deal? I understand the whole thing about the royals can't marry someone who's been divorced or whatever BUT she's not in any authority in the family. Oh sure she's the Queen sister BUT really she can't rule the country IF she dies, it would go to her son Charles and then Will and so on and so forth. Don't get me started on that...Charles doesn't even want to be King, we know that from Princess Diana death...aww she was a beautiful flower. The show itself was really interesting and entertaining BUT a bit slow in parts. I think they could have done without some of the details like them going to Africa or Australia which I think was a fuller to take up space to get to the next storyline. I can't believe this show cost what 120 million to make...I can see how because of the costumes, jewels and the castles but dang why so much? Why not use costume jewelry we the viewer wouldn't know and it would be cheaper. The Crown ISN'T the real Royal family so why spend so much on a show that viewers only spend 8 bucks a month to view on their PS4...which is what I use. Matt is worth watching and the lady who plays the Queen was really good. Should you watch it...yeah why not. I mean if you can get pass some of the slow parts then yes it's worth a viewing.",9
"Brilliant. One star loss for a bit too much Diana","So.... Controversial or not season 6 was the best and the worst of the whole 6 season. In contrast to its start, finished brilliantly with great writing and acting. I respect the choice of having Diana a big part of the past few season but I thought the first half of this season was way too Diana heavy. I get she still draws in a certain mystic, but I feel like it didn't need to be so much.This felt a little departure from interesting back stories of the royal family and the UK to a tabloid driven romance. However this was quickly rectified by bringing it back on track and making it about the ""Crown""The light touching subject of the apparent wedge between the 2 princes was briefly addressed and left to be resolved by the audience when this becomes reality.Going backwards from season 1 up until 6 this is a great semi realistic account of what one can't deny to be the world most talked about and well known family of all time. Felt genuine and realistic and good to see some humanity to the institution that even the ones inside are subjugated to.I would dare to say it even merits a second watch at some future point. Great British story told by great British cast.",6
"Beautiful except for the portrayal of the Duke of Windsor","It has lush set pieces and I feel like the music brings the user along on the emotional journey of the characters. However, the portrayal of the Duke of Windsor as a dedicated husband who was forced to give everything up for love is very one sided picture of one of twentieth century's most questionable characters.The show deliberately omits his and Wallis Simpson's unwavering dedication to Hitler, the Nazis, & that ideology, and I feel that - especially in this day and age - is grossly irresponsible by the Producers; especially, since this as well as Wallis's previous promiscuity (she was sleeping with the King before the divorce from the 2nd husband) were responsible for the refusal by TPTB to recognize even a morganatic marriage between her and King Edward VIII.At one point, the Duke and Duchess were under strong suspicion of passing U.K. secrets to the Nazis. A suspicion strong enough that both Sir Robert Vansittart and J Edgar Hoover where convinced of their complicity.Let's put aside for now the fact that they spent the majority of the 30s cavorting around Europe with the likes of Goebbels and Hitler, here is a quote from the people they proclaimed to be their best friends.""Diana Mosley, The Duchess of Windsor: A Memoir (1969) The Windsors agreed with me, and the Duchess was certainly politically sophisticated and knew exactly what she was doing and saying, that World War I had been a total failure, that it was a disaster the Austro-Hungarian Empire had been broken up, that the Versailles Treaty was grossly unfair, and that Germany should never have been encircled in the 1930s. If Hitler had been given a free hand to destroy Communism, and if he had been allowed to deport the Jews, if Britain and America had accepted them, there would have been no need for a holocaust. There was of course no room in Palestine for them. Hitler felt the Jews behaved abominably in Germany after World War I, and all he wanted to do was be rid of them. And one mustn't forget that anti-Semitism was endemic everywhere in Central Europe: the Poles hated them, the Czechs hated them, everyone did. Of course, my husband and the Windsors and I felt that we could not exonerate Hitler for being impatient and provoking World War II. With two egos like Churchill and Hitler, there was little chance for peace in the world. But still, if the right people had been in power in England, particularly Lloyd George, there could have been a negotiated peace.""And I'm not even going to include the numerous insults she leveled at other 'races' or the multiple other occasions on which she either excused or approved of Nazi rhetoric.Yet, none of these important traits of the Duke & Duchess Windsor's personalities makes it into the show at all; traits that the rest of the Windsor family tried hard to avoid and disavow.I would love to give this show a 9 or a 10, but this is irresponsible storytelling. And if you're going to omit something this important, what else are you leaving out?",2
"Lost me on episode 3, first season","First two episodes were solid, then the ""making up history"" political nonsense started. The Great Smog was a freakish set of circumstances and any blame was bi-partisan in nature. In real life, Churchill was never singularly blamed. No one in British society at the time possessed the knowledge to enable them to predict those dynamics would happen. Lessons were learned and they took corrective action, like normal people.At least Peaky Blinders and Outlander waited a few seasons before the 21st Century propaganda kicked in.",10
"Season 5 and I'm losing interest","Loved the first seasons, but in season 5 I find myself losing interest. None of the characters are particularly likeable. Where is the Queen's warmth and sense of humour? Actually I found the story of Prince Phillips interest in driving horse carriages and how he restores the old carriage the most intriguing! The story of Dodi is plain boring, and the actors without charisma. Charles and it seems he is an intelligent man with great passions for nature and environmental issues as well as architecture. Through his Trust he has helped thousands of young people of little means learn new skills so they can start their own businesses or getting employment. He is also said to have a great talent for interacting with people on the street, all the while being mocked and ridiculed like nobody else. All this is barely mentioned. His sole purpose is to be awfully cold and stiff and horrible, which Dominic West excels in.",10
"The Crown is just absolutely fantastic","I might be one of the few people here who actually is in favour of the change of cast in season 3 and although I absolutelty adore the cast from season 1 and 2 (no doubt they were absolutely brilliant!) ,I am also enjoying seeing a more mature presence with the cast from season 3, though I confess I miss seeing Vanessa Kirby as Princess Margaret.
What I love about The Crown is the absolute attention to detail and the way that each episode moves the story at a beautiful yet intriguing pace without ever rushing it.
Season 3 is being my favourite so far (haven't watched season 4 yet), I just absolutely love it, particularly from episode 3 onward.
It was great to have a better understanding of Charle's life and I am glad they gave a better insight to his story prior to Diana, I actually feel a lot of empathy for him (at least up until season 3) and Josh O'Connor is just an absolutely amazing actor.
My recomendation would be if you can go past the change of cast, to give it a go at seaon 3, there is much to it.Hope this is helpful.",10
"Calmly Solid & Engaging","(Flash Review)If you ever wanted to get an inside scoop into how the royal family truly functions, this is a prime example as I'm pretty sure this is mostly true to history. It follows Queen Elizabeth II from a young princess as she grows into 'the crown' as Queen. Each episode focuses on a nicely contained subject or event and all details are true to period and highly accurate. You get a neat perspective to see how the Queen interacts with the Prime Minister (played amazingly by John Lithgow) and parliament, her sister, husband and parents. As well as her uncle, The King, who abdicated the thrown for his love, who had two previous husbands, making her ineligible to be his queen. There is also a surprising amount of power or influence given to those in charge of maintaining tradition and honor to the family lineage and to the crown. Great pacing, smart dialog, high quality production value and it is very engaging as the acting, dialog and episode scripts are spot on.",8
"Season 3 disappoints, but only if you've seen the first 2 seasons","I have thoroughly enjoyed 'The Crown' and been impressed by the great writing, acting and direction of this great series. I felt Claire Foy had the grace, poignancy and stiff upper lip that I imagine the young queen herself would possess.Season 3 has age writing, and amazing atmosphere of majesty well in hand, but Olivia Colman (who has been a great actress) is just a shadow of Foy's royal heinous performance.Colman's Queen is self deprecating and you vulnerable for a woman who has been through all that we've witnessed of the struggles in season 1 and 2. Perhaps it's cruel to expect anyone to carry on in the original; character's stead, but in this case it simply doesn't work. The other new actors don't live up tp their predecessors either, in my opinion, though all are very good at how they play their characters.
Vanessa Kirby is the finest actor I've seen in decades....it's almost unbelievable how believable her portrayal of Margeret has been. Helena Bonham Carter is amazing in everything she does, including 'The Crown' but even she cannot steal the lesser crown from Ms.Kirby.
I continue to watch and if I try not to recall the first two seasons, I do enjoy these episodes, but I'm afraid they will always be the red headed step children of this series.",10
"Great show","I loved the first 2 seasons and even more the new cast! I think they are so brilliant, and after some time, they make you forget the previous actors. tobias and olivia and helena are very realistic in their roles. Uncredible Gillian as well. 10/10",10
"Outstanding","This is he only reason why I signed up for Netflix. The acting is beyond outstanding. I had heard about this series from a friend and once I started it, went straight through the first 2 seasons. Huge congratulations to the cast, writers, not to mention set/costume designers as the locations/set and clothes (the clothes!) absolutely make this series.",9
"SO GOOD UNTIL SEASON 3","Please bring back the old cast which I have emotionally invested so much in. I personally found the third season grown stale since the cast changed, not even Tommy could be saved. The new cast just doesn't work the same. I thought okay, maybe this takes time getting used but no just no. I've seen Colman in Fleabag and she is no doubt an outstanding actress but this role is meant for Claire Foy only. My complaint could get extended to the rest of the cast, that's just how much I adore them. Utterly blown away by Season 1,2. Great writing, comprehensive details and beautiful cinematography. Each eps runs for an hour or so and strangely I could put up with it, no fuss. Season 3, I still find the story compelling but sometimes it bored me, I don't know, there is a chance that I'm biased since I strongly wish for the old cast to come back and remake every episode on this season.",10
"John Lithgow is AMAZING","I am so sad there is only one season on Netflix!! :( This series has exceeded my expectations and because of it I wish to travel to London one day. I've really come to understand so much more about the monarchy than I ever did before. I've done a bit of research and this series seems to be pretty accurate and true so far. I am in my 40's and have always seen John Lithgow in so many movies. I've always seen him as superb actor but his role as Winston Churchill is nothing short of spectacular! This character has made me laugh and cry. He portrays Churchill as difficult, stubborn, and sometimes mean but so gentle at the same time. I just wish I could hug him! I will be very surprised if John does not win an award for this performance",10
"i like it","The series has kept a high level of professionalism, acting",6
"A Brilliant Series Ruined","I have been a hold out. All my friends have watched The Crown and raved about the show. With nothing to watch, I turned on The Crown. I was captivated. Claire Foy, and Matt Smith were mesmerizing as the royal couple. I watched seasons one and two in two days. Ready to relax into another binge session and watch season three, I turned on the TV and Foy and Smith are gone. I watched three episodes but the new cast does not engage me. Such a shame as I was prepared to watch this series to the end. Not anymore.",3
"The show was totally destroyed after full switch of the cast","The first seasons with the original actors were a masterpiece, but once all actors were switched by the new ones - it took off all of the good flavors of these series. New actors are professional and are trying to do their best, but they are so different from the characters that you get loved with in the first seasons - that whole show becomes a big-big fiasco. I cannot understand what lead the directors of the show for such a drastic replacement of all actors, but it was absolutely wrong decision.
I cannot convince of force myself to keep on watching these series, no matter how good is the plot. Extremely disappointing!",9
"The Crown: A Great Work.","It's a great work: 60 episodes (currently only the first twenty have been shot and released) but Peter Morgan is no doubt a great Author ('Rush, 2013', 'Hereafter, 2010', 'Frost/Nixon, 2008'). Season two is way better than season one, the cast is sensational and everybody puts life in his/her one character. The beautiful Claire Foy (for whom I have a soft spot) rightfully rules over the cast while the main guest star still remains Stephen Dillane from Season 1 (episode nine: the court painter). I really enjoyed the first 20 episodes and I wait for the 30 more to go...",10
"Masterpiece show , one of the greatest of all time","This show is incredible so well done in every aspect. They creators do their best to make it as accurate as possible which is very reassuring. Very interesting storyline to see how the royal family operates and the challenges they face and how disconnected they are from reality and the public.The cinematography, soundtrack, performance , writing is all AAA, and honestly I can't wait until the next season is released, it's just such a good show and I hope Netflix keeps fund it, and more importantly I hope they go all the way to the present day including the death of the queen and coronation of King Charles.",10
"A truly stunning masterpiece","The Crown is by far one of the best shows I have had the pleasure of watching. It is easy to see how Netflix managed to spend so much money on the production. The cinematography is breathtaking and could easily rival, if not surpass the level of quality presented in today's biggest and best features. Of course, not everything that makes a show great is just the cinematography alone. The story-line and dialogue is expertly written, each and every line feels authentic and genuine. The acting was impeccable from all cast members, as was the mis-en-scene, which really felt historically accurate and transports the viewer into the past. In my opinion, this series easily rivals the likes of House of Cards, Narcos and many other flagship series across the board.The story isn't riddled with endless action, or constrained so much by dramatic conventions. It simply follows a historically accurate time-line of real events. Some may argue the entire series is 'Monarchy Propaganda', however I disagree. The story provides a solid and unbiased view of the Royal Family and its values. The viewer is left to make the decision for themselves, whilst the show simply presents the moral and ethical dilemmas experienced by the Royal Family from both sides of the argument.To summarize; watch this series, it will keep you on the edge of your seat without the need for exaggerated scenarios and conventional on-screen relationships. You will get to see the monarchy as it really is, whether that is in a negative or positive light, is your decision...",9
"I now view the Queen in a different light.","As a Brit I was factually aware of most of the historical events. However it opened my eyes on a couple of points. How the Queen broke a pledge she made to her father and sister, I really felt for Margret how she was treated regarding Peter Townsend if you take into consideration how Harry had the red carpet rolled out for Megan. Also I never thought I would have any sympathy for Charles until I watched how badly he was treated especially in his adolescence. The series is very well made and in my opinion was factually accurate. Enjoyable watch I look forward to season four especially because princess Diane comes on the scene.",8
"Good - but glorifies the royal family too much","I cannot explain why I like this show so much. I suppose it reaches into the unconscious mind in a way that is hard to describe - much like a painting of a place I've never been to and will never see in person - yet the art draws me in and makes me want to learn more. The story is about Queen Elizabeth II when she gets the throne - and as I watch I find it truly amazing that she has been the queen since the 1950's. The show has flawless sets, costumes, lights, acting, writing. Jarred Harris is perfect as Elizabeth's father - the flashback scenes with him are dynamic. The music is breathtaking - and for whatever reason - the show is oddly perfect. But I should ad - much of the suffering humankind has endured over the last five hundred years is in large part due to the greed and barbarism of the colonial rulers - and this family has profited in excessive privilege when so many have suffered. So for that - I dock this story points for glorifying them on a pedestal that is perhaps too high.",10
"My favourite season","While everyone complaining about how boring the last season is...I must say it was my favourite one.I watched all episodes in one day!Amazing drama..but just drama. The reality will be always unknown for us.Certainly there is at least one thing why we still need the monarchy. Without them will be the real boring..
.Even to interfere so much in their private lifes and make a telenovela for every single event of their lifes is so intrusive invasive, almost barbaric I would say.Every human being deserves to live his short life how he wants and the most important is what good you do not drama.",10
"Beautiful biopic","I started this series because of leading male role Matt Smith doctor who ... I loved it ...
ALL HAIL TO QUEEN MAJESTY",10
"John Lithgow as Churchill is his best in the Assassins episode","I'm writing this primarily to praise John Lithgow in his role as Sir Winston Churchill. I haven't seen all Lithgow's film work and none of his stage work, so my praise is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, the scene in the ""Assassins"" episode when Churchill has his final sitting with the artist who paints his portrait--well, Lithgow obviously pulled it all out when he portrays Churchill's grief over the death of his daughter, Marigold, and the meaning that Churchill imposes on his own landscapes of the pond in his own yard...the delivery of dialogue, posture, and especially the expression on his face and the skill of the director and cinematographer--all combine to make it one of the most tragically human moments I've ever seen on a TV series. Perfect. The product of a lifetime of acting experience. I hope that Lithgow would look back on this scene as one of his best, although that's not my business to tell a man how he ought to measure his own life's achievements.I'm not finished watching the series itself, but I'm hooked. Excellent dialogue in the writing and fantastic delivery by almost every actor. Costuming, set design, lighting, music, direction, cinematography: bravo.",7
"The final episodes are a mixed bag","The last episodes of The Crown are a mixed bag. I was prepared to eyeroll at the depiction of William and Kate, but they are actually a highlight of the series. Sadly, the final Harry and Camilla simply look awful (there must have been better hairstyles for both of them) and Harry's character is written to be completely petulant. No matter what you think of him now, he was a popular prince when he was younger. The Middletons look nothing like themselves. Jonathan Pryce as Prince Philip gives the most sympathetic performance, while Imelda Staunton does not seem to have any fun at all. At least she perks up a bit right at the end with a good speech that leaves out the most famous line, something that robs it of its real humor.",5
"Season 1 & 2 were good and credible","Seasons 3 & 4 are ridiculous in the overacting and unbelievable story lines. It's more like Spitting Image on acid than a drama. Anti monarchist and silly in its attempt to create something to appeal to the masses.",8
"Season 3: Olivia Colman gives an excellent acting performance","Season 3: Olivia Colman gives an excellent acting performanceI feel obliged to counter the many negative reviews. In fact I found that Olivia Colman gave an above average, fine acting performance. In fact she appears to me exactly as I expect the queen to be. The authoritative, a bit cold person, determined to fulfill the ""job"" with dignity.
So Colman suits the role very well. I don't get it how people expect a somewhat updated Foy as good-looking, lovely everybodys darling here, that would be miscast!Season 3 has less (artificial?) drama than season 1+2, I felt it a bit overdrawn there sometimes, has less thrill and is therefore indeed adequate, as the queens life surely is/was not an extraordinary adventure, but over long stretches an unglamorous tribute to duty. I do agree that season 3 lost a bit of pace due that Winston has gone now, the entertaining level may have lowered, but so what? Pepping up the script with artificial drama IMO would ruin this excellent serie.",9
"Entertaining","I read the royal family doesn't like the way they're being portrayed in The Crown which is funny because I thought it was a little too flattering. There were several things that happened in the show that I had to Google to see if they were true. I don't know why they replaced Claire Foy (Queen Elizabeth) & Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret) and didn't just use makeup to age them as they speak completely different. John Lithgow as Winston Churchill & Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher were amazing especially considering they're American. The way they portrayed Princess Diana as a simpering fool with mental health issues was the only thing I didn't like about it.**EDITED -I really liked the first four seasons of The Crown but S5 was disappointing. Imelda Staunton is great as Queen Elizabeth although Olivia Coleman is still my favorite. I do not like Jonathan Pryce and I didn't like him as Prince Philip at all. Elizabeth Debicki was perfect as Princess Diana but I don't like how the writers portrayed her. Again she is portrayed as an unstable, needy and insecure woman almost as bad as the movie Spencer. They make it seem like she was completely paranoid for no reason. She's also portrayed as a subpar mom who confides in Prince William way too much and causes him unnecessary worry.I've loved Dominic West since The Wire and even though he is way too handsome to be Prince Charles he did a good job portraying him. This season seemed to drag and be rushed at the same time and the ending was meh.",9
"Rich and Real !","Every pilot episode has to present all possible aspects of the entire plot to come . In this beautiful first episode we clearly see King George in a very clear for shedullig with his already fragile health having to teach the innocent princess Elisabeth everything that is necessary to be a queen, her daughter, Princess Margareth enchanting herself by the king's right arm ( married man ), we clearly see that her personality is not about royalty, probably coming to check his reputation. We also saw the rise of philipp who abdicates his nationality and military career to be Elisabeth's husband but soon listens to the king himself that the ""weight "" the duchy would not be his titles, but ""she"", she is the job, who will have to give up a lot in life to support the queen who is far above her wife. We also see the people's respect for Prime Minister Winston Churchill.Photography extremely rich in details and always when we see the king we are in a smoky environment.Elisabeth shines when she holds the paper crown, a child's gift to the king at Christmas, and when she sits in her father's chair , place where the future of the nation is decided . She doesn't even know if she has the ability to represent him on a tour of Africa . Fragile, docile and conniving wife with her husband's decisions.The Crown, is a series based on real facts, slow and full of intrigues where the crown is above personal options or desires, and this is where conflicts arise, because everything the royal family does, speaks or dresses has a giant result in the English nation .An absurdly rich series in details and with stupendous performances, revolving around Queen Elisabeth's bow.",10
"Instant Classic","A surprising great series to watch. I am not a close follower of the British crown, so I find the series enlightening, informative and entertaining. The stories were well written, directed, and acted. My favorite (and sadden for) was Princess Margaret.I love forward to the new Season 5.",10
"Incredibly acted without having to add the shock factor","A rare gem. Acting, settings, etc...incredible. Most Netflix shows seem to add the 'shock factor'. This series can rest on its laurels...superb acting and an initially slow beginning that ultimately captivates and enthralls you. Claire Foy is incredible as well as John Lithgow and the rest of the cast. Can't wait for season 3!!",9
"Crown & Pony (No Spoilers)","There are lots of positives about this series -- the cast and costume design are really on point throughout the series so far (Bravo Claire Foy especially!). I'd like to take a moment to admonish Netflix for always making their opening credits SO drawn out; you can't put such a slow start on a story that will be mostly about quiet control the way this series is....Getting back to the plot, the flashback scenes are very well done and the ""insider"" view of Elizabeth II's actions are a bit more honest and candid than expected. It's a nice touch to show that the wardrobe of her younger days is very much the same as her wardrobe today -- indicating, I suppose, that her mindset in life and leadership have not much changed. Her natural tendency to be frugal (especially in the face of less frugal direct relatives) also helps explain her response to Diana in more recent years; it's not a matter of disliking one person, but of respecting and maintaining a legacy. Foy does an excellent job of conveying this.I'm SO curious to know how accurate the portrayal of King Phillip (QE's husband and consort) is. The series paints him as rather a madcap (NO SPOILERS) which is very hard to believe. Did it really take him so long to ""fall into step""? Perhaps it would have been nice to flashback to when Elizabeth II was a youthful teen and first writing to Philip. The light in which he's portrayed in Season 1 is particularly unflattering. (NO SPOILERS.)Another striking message in the series is the constant reminder that smoking leads to cancer. While several of the characters are found to be smoking as though it were an elegant habit -- or perhaps chomping on a cigar like an old school bulldog as the classic Churchill was known to do -- Elizabeth II reminds those closest to her how cigarettes affected her life. Every new reign begins with a funeral... the loss of a beloved monarch... and this one to cancer. (Well done, Ben Caron & company.)It's sweet to show that Elizabeth II sees her father as a figure to follow (as opposed to some of the more blustering monarchs England has suffered historically) yet is aware of her own shortcomings -- a self-consciousness I believe she also inherited from her father -- and maintains a modest but constant effort to improve herself. It's important to know that the decision for her heirs to attend university (and not just shine in the public light and rely solely on the knowledge of private tutors) is very forward for more than one reason. Well done, everyone. If possible, try to shorten the credits....",9
"Great series","Just started recently watching this amazing history themed series, even though I'm not that much into these kinds of series I have to say its brilliant. I was surprised to hear how much one episode is costing Neflix to do this, and asked myself is this why you cancelled two other brilliant Neflix originals ? I'm talking about Marco Polo and Sense8. Netflix reason of cancelling these was that they are to expensive, but you plan to make another 4 seasons of The Crown ... love how you think Netflix.",8
"Seasons 1-2 were great, then fiction takes over","I've given it 8 stars for the first two seasons which i thought were great, and definitely one of the best things on TV. Claire foy played the young queen as a strong, intelligent lady but then season three came along and olivia coleman gave her a complete personality change. She dumbed her down - its almost like they are playing two completely different characters,
but even worse than that was how the writer seemed to change the way he treated history. The stories don't ring true anymore, and you start wondering in the back of your head about what is real and what is made up while you're watching it. You find yourself googling the history after each episode to check it really happened, only to discover that a good 50% of it is total baloney.Part of the joy of the first two seasons is learning about the real people and real events, and when he starts embellishing it with fiction it loses something.The mountbatten coup episode is where he really started to lose me, because you realise that he's deliberately trying to make the royals look bad by adding outlandish stuff that never happened.The first two seasons are a classy historical drama... after that it just becomes an unbelievable soap opera.",8
"When art is more entertaining than life","I immensely enjoyed ""Downton Abbey"" while I find this series incredibly dull. It's a testament that sometimes fiction is more entertaining than real life. True, the real Royal Family has had its share of drama over the years, but it's just a series of low-simmering events and unexciting characters that do not make a show engaging to watch. Now season 4 refreshingly showcases Princess Diana, finally offering some redeeming value because her mere presence is iconic and the actress's portrayal is spot-on. That's when the fast-forward slider on Netflix becomes useful, so you get to jump to those Princess Diana moments.",6
"The wheels came off the tracks after season 2","Gillian Anderson is a very good actress but she sounds like she had a stroke in this series. She sounds nothing like the Margaret Thatcher I know. The show lost it's once bright luster, time to call it a day.",4
"Gripping!","Watched this right after Victoria and Abdul which was moronic. Not generally into series, I keep finding excuses not to bother with stuff like Game of Thrones, but The Crown, blew me away.. Claire Foy as Elizabeth,Jared Harris as Bertie and Matt Smith as Prince Phillip own their roles. John Lithgow as Churchill is astounding. As someone who loves reading biographies (currently devouring Jenkins Gladstone) This mixes historical accuracy with drama exceedingly well. Cant wait for season 2!",9
"Great Story","This series has a very intresting story and makes me want to see more.",10
"Good historical series to watch!","The Crown is a historical drama television series about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, created and written by Peter Morgan and produced by Left Bank Pictures and Sony Pictures Television for Netflix. Morgan developed the series from his film The Queen (2006) and his stage play The Audience (2013), which also focused on Elizabeth.This series focuses on Queen Elizabeth II as a young newlywed faced with leading the world's most famous monarchy while forging a relationship with legendary Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill. The British Empire is in decline, the political world is in disarray, but a new era is dawning. Peter Morgan's masterfully researched scripts reveal the Queen's private journey behind the public with daring frankness. Prepare to see into the coveted world of power and privilege behind the locked doors of Westminster and Buckingham Palace.I really love the casting in seasons 1 and 2, especially Claire Foy as Young Queen Elizabeth II and Vanessa Kirby as Young Princess Margaret. I think both of them are stunning in their characters. But I don't like the casting in other seasons. For me, it doesn't align with the actors in seasons 1 and 2. I think they could find actors who were more similar. The story in each episode is very detailed. But sometimes it's a bit boring. I think it's more suitable to watch it to learn about British history and the British royal family than just for fun.My favorite character is Young Princess Margaret because she is the soul of the royal family. She is vivacious, intelligent and talented. I like the way she does everything with her wholeheartedly. My impression of this series is that it tells the story of the British royal family from before Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne. Including important events of each member of the royal family. It allows us to see many aspects of the royal family, both in performing their duties and in their private lives.",8
"Great!","Love the way we're told a story that no one (but the Queen!) will ever know if real! Yet ...I feel like this IS a true story and a good one at that. Best ever actors all the way in all the episodes",9
"A very fruitful watch","I deeply loved this series and enjoyed watching every episode of it but in fact, I tend to see Winston Churchill as the main character in the first season, he was the guide of Queen Elizabeth, also I was really surprised by how the actor was doing it so great.Claire Foy is the best appointment for Queen, not only does she looks just like the young Elizabeth, but also she talks and acts like her in every way possible.I fact-checked most of the people and events while watching the series and I was totally impressed by the fact that most of it is totally based on true, real events and this I think was a challenge for the producers on how to preserve the historical accuracy and to create a drama work..",10
"The show has been good","All the the characters till now has been placed so perfectly.. but the character i was waiting for has finally arrived Princess Diana Nd Iron Lady Thatcher....",9
"We have been much amused","Bloody good acting and I now understand the impossible position of a monarch that turns out to be a human.",8
"Anderson is awful","The fourth season is off and running, with Lady Di making her reasonably well cast appearance. Season 3 showed a sympathetic look at Prince Charles, which surprised me a bit. He seemed hopelessly ill prepared and unsuitable to be the heir apparent until that season. But now watching season 4, with Margaret Thatcher taking over as Prime Minister, this falls horribly flat. Andersons voice styling is horrendous. She sounds unlike Thatcher at all, indeed sounds like laryngitis has struck her firmly. I do hope she makes limited appearances in this season and moving forward.",8
"RIP The Crown","Not to take away from Olivia Coleman who is of course an amazing actress; however, woefully miscast in this role following Claire Foy who will remain the screen Queen of our hearts. Coleman's Queen is wholly unlikeable, perhaps on purpose. Rest of the supporting cast, especially Bonham-Carter are excellent, and once you look past the new Queen, the series is okay, but nothing of what it once was!",7
"Why, why change the cast?","You had such a winner in the first two seasons, why would you ruin it. I get angry every time I watched season 3. So disappointing with the new casting. Claire Foy was perfection as Elisabeth & the chemistry with all the cast worked perfectly in Season 1 & 2. Why would you do this to your fans. So, so disappointing!!",2
"Wonderful! Amazing!","A wonderful and amazing series. Amazing cast from season 1 to season 4 . Extremely interesting and fascinating! Beautiful music as well",10
"Visually brilliant, precise, and wonderfully delivered","There is not much to fault in this production about the lives of the Royal family and world of they live in.Nothing is left out of place in delivering the story even if there has been some artistic liberties, it really does not matter. You are never left scurrying to Wikipedia to find more about these people, or to check historical facts. It's good enough as it is.Impeccable performances make the players feels very real from the start, in cinema that is visually brilliant. I've not been disappointed with this first season and eager for the next.The Crown is just one of those rare masterpieces of television.",9
"First class production","The Crown is an outstanding show. It beautifully shows the life of the Royal family and the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. Historical shows and films always hit it out of the park when made with accuracy, excellent direction, production and style. The Crown is an example of this. It is made with such style, poise and charm one is simply taken by the lives of the family and great historic figures over those years. The acting is truly first class as is the production of the series which makes a dynamic, eventful and truly engaging show. Claire Foy is exceptional as the Queen as are the rest of the cast. Netflix has elevated its reputation as a service and the standards of television shows. Highly recommended. 8.5/10",9
"Amazing How They Have Held Onto Power","I'm writing this review after episode 7 of season 2. It's unbelievable how this family has held onto power for a millennium. For those who do not know the Firm became ""The Windsors"" in the early 1900s because they were related to all of the German Keisers and it would look bad when going to war. They were the House of Sachs-Coburg and Gotha before Windsor and the House of Wettin before that. Dating all the way back to the 10th century. It also wasn't just England which the family ruled. They ascended to the thrones of Belgium, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Poland, and others at one point or another. Deeply rooted in tradition and Aristocracy I find it amazing how they've held onto power for so long. Especially because of how they are portrayed in this show.From what I've seen they are extremely uneducated. At one point the 3 women didn't know what was opposite North on a map. Non-North the Queen called it. The Queen mother when reading an article about Einstein said he changed his mind again but had no idea what about. The Queen mother and entire family is so pompous. However they are surrounded by Aristocrats and Bureaucrats who continue to prop up the importance of traditions and the Royal Family. I find this is because of their own wealth and interests. Over the last decade the top 600 Aristocratic families have doubled their wealth. In a time of Progressive movements and transparency they continue to enrich themselves. The Royal Family however takes things into the stratosphere. Did you know the Windsor's are the single largest welfare recipients on Earth? Taxes go directly to them for jewelry, servitude, cars, yachts, and everything else. These Royals even have people who dress them. It's absurd the English continue to allow it.Queen Elizabeth is literally a robot. The only emotion she ever shows is jealousy. Mainly for her sister Margaret. She makes it seem like she doesn't want the Crown when it reality she loves it. She is so uneducated and cognitively inept that it's scary she makes important decisions for the country. On the other hand she singlehandedly saved the Monarchy. Over the past 70 years there has been more transparency into the Monarchy than ever before thanks to technology. It would have been easy for tradition and pageantry to be tossed aside. Walking this line and allowing access to House of Royalty, honor, and duty also may have backfired with everyday people who were struggling but it didn't. It only strengthened her power and made her perhaps the most famous person ever. Much of this has to do with her husband Philip.What can I say? Philip is the man! I'm writing this just a couple days after he died and I'm glad I got to see what he was like as a younger man before he died. I respect the hell out of him. It's not easy to have been him. Constantly in your wife's shadow and rarely not in the public eye. While watching I was hoping he and Margaret would get together. What a pair they would have made. Margaret just got dragged around by her sister but honestly Margaret you have the easiest life in the entire world. You are filthy rich with no responsibility and beautiful. The only problem you've ever had is who out of millions of suitors would you marry. You have staff that waits on you every second. Get over it.The whole lifestyle of dinners, parties, and pageantry is enough to make one sick. The stuffiness of British aristocracy and the mustaches as Philip called them in the cabinet. It's no wonder our Founding Fathers did not want a Monarchy in America. I will say Elizabeth's father did seem like a good man and a good King and I think that's because he wasn't raised to be King. People weren't telling him since birth that he was divine and the future King of UK. He had a duty thrust on him and he did his job.Finally Wallis Simpson and King Edward the abdicated. I know they were sympathetic to Nazis but can you blame them? They were literally all related to them, just as Elizabeth is. And no one could see what they'd become just as Edward said. It turned out great that he stepped down because the Nazis turned out pure evil and needed to be stopped. However the way the family treated Wallis was horrific.Nowadays the Royals getting married or divorced is no big deal, but back then it was the end of the world. The family treated Wallis abhorrently like she was a leper. From what I've seen in the show so far the two really do love each other. It's maybe the most iconic love story of all time. The King of England gave up his throne to marry the woman he loves. What's more romantic than that?!Overall the show has been very good. It's insight into a World that very few people know anything about. A world built by a Dynasty that has survived for centuries and is more powerful than ever. What they've managed to do is nothing short of extraordinary. The allure and respect this family still commands. I don't understand it, but people love it. Queen Elizabeth has brought the Windsors into the modern age as she continues her grip on power for the 8th decade in a row. Think of that?!? She has ruled for 8 consecutive decades! 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000's, 2010's, 2020's. You don't stay in power that long without knowing how to play the Game.",8
"Epic and Outstanding!!!!","One of the finest shows I've ever watched. It features excellent writing, acting, and very high production values. Even though all the actors are great Claire Foy and John Lithgow's performances as Queen Elizabeth II and Winston Churchill are fantastic!! Everything in this show is at its best. The back-ground score and the locations, especially the Buchingham Palace shown are awesome (now I know why it's the most expensive TV series ever created). I went into watching this show thinking I would be bored, but to my surprise it's become one of my favourite shows. I feel this is once in a lifetime series which you should watch. Experience larger than life with ""THE CROWN"".",10
"Extraordinary!","I learned so mang things about this show. One particular thing is how the Queen value the monarchy. Worth to watch! Hands down! ☝🏻",10
"Can't help but binge-watch","Ever since I stumbled upon the TV series I've been binge-watching them from the moment the season comes out
Their latest season didn't fail to impress
Being a huge Potterhead myself, at the beginning I couldn't stop hearing Umbridge's voice in stead of the queen's , but this changed quickly with each episode
All of the cast looks so much like the original people that sometimes I forget this is not a 100% accurate history documentary
However, I found that Ms Debicki tends to be a bit slimmer that the original Diana, while Mr West tends to be too handsome, compaired to the original
Other than that I don't find any other faults and have kept on recommending the series to almost all of my friends
Always impatient for the next season
Pitty they ended the fifth season on this event they've chosen, but it's understandable why they've chosen it as it's cliffhanger.",9
"Season 1","This is the most expensive show on Netflix it is absolutely a must watch because of the visuals, acting and direction !! Plus its like a documentary you learn so much about the British political system and the monarchy !!",10
"So close to total brilliant","The first seasons where amazing Claire foy was our queen you let us love and hate her you let us adore her children and see her struggles. Between crown and her personal views. But then u tanked us you changed ever major role im looking at the screen saying Helena should of been queen that would be more believed!! I was so in love with the story line princess Margaret was so beautiful and having a baby and then bam what a slap in the face I lost all disconnected I felt like a part of there life now im looking at strangers!! The first seasons are the best! Do better next time dont do this to people this is why u loose ratings give people a change to adore you longer!",7
"Season 3 ruined by Olivia Colman's portrayal","So disappointed in the portrayal of the Queen in season 3. She is portrayed as someone who is haughty, condescending, and has no warmth at all (unlike the actress in seasons 1 and 2). There is not even one thing likable in season 3's Queen Elizabeth. And the actress' delivery is so fast - I've heard the actual Queen interviewed, and she does not speak with this ""machine gun"" rapidity. Season 3 is awful in my opinion.",1
"Best show ever!!!!!","This is honestly the best show I've ever seen I am completely obsessed and waiting in between seasons being released seems like forever. Please keep making more & maybe let the seasons be longer Than 10 episodes its not enough",10
"Captivating and if you have no knowledge about Royal family, Just watch the show.","I delayed watching the show for a long time. But as I began watching it, it turned out to be one of the best shows I've seen. And if you are someone with no knowledge of Royal family, I would suggest you go for it. It will be an eye opener providing a great deal of understanding about how constitutional monarchy works. It was interesting yet saddening to see how Queen is often put in a difficult position where she has to choose her duty over her family. It raises every ounce of respect I have for Queen. The show thus displays emotions and politics together marvelously. The story is portrayed in a serious tone with no eye candies popping in between. No nudity or bold conversation, It is purely to display the life of Queen and people around her. Claire Foy played the The Queen so impeccably that for a while I had assumed her the real Queen considering the fact that they have a kind resemblance with each other. The dialogue delivery and acting skills are at their best. You'll only want more and more from them. Initially you might get bored in understanding the characters but as the plot builds, it gets interesting keeping you hitched for the next episode.",8
"10 stars but awful disturbing music direction","10 stars for the effort, idea and what it is.Critic:
The most disturbing music direction I have ever witnessed in TV series.Epic music for Duck Shooting?
Hans Zimmer and Zimmerish music for The Crown? Is this Dan Brown?Fear and suspense in every episode?
Are our lives in constant fear?I started enjoying the music in S2E5, when it made sense and synchronised.",10
"Couldn't have been made better!!!","Superb acting and the actors cast are very well suited for their roles. Tremendous effort has been put in this series and is it honestly perfection. I usually find dramas quite boring but this series brings the past to life and it is so interesting to learn intricate details of history without making the viewer bored. I highly recommend this series, it is extremely entertaining. I hope this series is completed and not cancelled anytime soon. Season 2 airs on December 8th 2017. Be sure to watch !!",9
"Outstanding!","As someone who is not a big enthusiast of the the Royal family, I have to say this is one of the most amazing tv series in recent years. Fascinating, enciteful, witty, sad, and heart wrenching. The acting by Clare Foy is captivating and honest and you can't stop yourself from feeling nothing but empathy for our queen. Even if you hate the royals please please don't miss out it is simply superb.",10
"Flawlessly executed!","By now, I've watched every season more than once. I must admit that seasons 1 &2 are my favorites. I do believe that Claire Foy and Matt Smith were the best actors portraying Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.The attention to detail throughout is stunning. Just so beautiful to look at, I could eat it! LoL! Do not miss!",10
"Brilliant, a great production!","Stunning visual, great acting, most of characters are just perfect, maybe a couple don't fit into the real people's shoes but it's hard to find people for every single character, isn't it?I really loved the queen's dialogs with the prime ministers, excellent and Filip actor did a great job too, both!I don't know about the historical accuracy because I didn't study so I can't comment but the film itself it is excellent! Really enjoyable!I definitely recommend watching and distant your mind from the real historical events.Well, I f you're a monarchist and if you love history then I will maybe understand your lower rating.",9
"Great cast. Poor plot.","This is good and well made show with brilliant cast, but it's lacking idia... It's Wiki picturization",7
"5 ruined it for me","I was a fan of The Crown and couldn't wait for the new season to arrive. Now I'm just disappointed. Let's talk about the cast: I loved the first two sets of actors, this season - epic fail. The Queen looks and acts like an old lady, nothing royal about her - and also her face... I'm not from the UK so I don't really know all the actors, but I'm sure they could have found someone who doesn't look like they just did botox (even if they didn't). Her character lacks that unspoken depth and dignity that previous actresses had. Prince Charles - maybe it's because the only role I saw that actor in was the on in The Affair - and I can't stop seeing THAT person, instead of Charles. He lacks emotion, just like the Queen - and in previous seasons we did see some. He was human in the first four seasons, and now he's just shallow, mean and superficial. Prince Philip, that used to be one of my favourites... not so much now. First of all, that actor looks like 80 - 90 years old, and prince was 70 at the time. Also he is portrayed like a good hearted wise old man, and if I understood his character correctly from the previous seasons - he's supposed to be witty and sarcastic. Now there's no trace of it. I have only seen 3 episodes so far - quite boring and not getting any better. One episode is about Prince Philip's passion for carriages (with horses) and one is completely dedicated to Diana's last casual fling's father. Not even the lover, but lover's father. So the series titled The Crown gives one whole episode to a relative of one of Lady Di casual lovers. She was only with Dodi for a very short time and it wasn't anything serious - just the tragic fact that she died in his company - but to dedicate whole episode to Dodi's dad makes no sense. This season was supposed to be about the turbulent marriage of Charles and Diana - and we have only seen bits and pieces, like the two of them are just supporting roles to the series that was once meant to be about them. We basically don't see much of a relationship - but that's maybe there really wasn't anything to be seen at the first place. I don't know if I'll have the patience to see all episodes, but the first 3 ruined the whole series for me.",3
"Television at its finest (Season 4 review)","The Crown has always been one of the highest quality shows in my opinion. It never stops to amaze me, with each season slightly better than the last one. But when it comes to season 4, it's undoubtedly the far superior season of the show so far. This season of The Crown features the most memorable performances in my recent memories. Especially the actors that played Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson), Prince Charles (Josh O' Connor) and Princess Diana (Emma Corrin). I was impressed by how uncanny their performances are to the real life characters. Body language, accent etc are all simply amazing! This season also in my opinion has the far superior writing and direction. Considering there are only 10 episodes dedicated to an important period of time for the UK and the royal family, I was dazzled on how it's able to cramp all of it into 10 episodes, while not feeling rushed and being consistently written and directed. It never fails to surprise me with such depth, emotion and wit in the writing. There are certain scenes that I just can't get out of my head because they are simply too beautifully written and executed! From the start to finish, season 4 of The Crown never fails to impress and surprise me. And I'm not afraid to say that this is one of the rare shows that are perfect and a masterpiece. 10/10 for me!",10
"Subtile","The themes of the episodes are so well-chosen. My preferred episode is ""favourites"". It is Margaret Thatcher that mentions to the Queen that her son is her favourite. And a bit later we as spectators find out why her daughter is not her faavourite. That scene in Thatcher's kitchen is so subtile. In parallel, the Queen wonders if every parent has a favourite child and she starts communicating with her children. It is revealing. Whether this all happened in reality, I do not care. It could have happened. And each episode has such a well-chosen theme that affects the royal family and someone in their inner circle in parallel. So good.",10
"A masterfully presented story","Everything is so detail oriented, so impeccably executed, that you feel you watch a documentary. There's just one thing that put me off; the recasting of Elizabeth and Margaret. I gradually got used to it, however I found the first actresses to bear much more resemblance to the characters they played.",9
"Love History, but aren't into reading? Watch this Show","My review isn't an account of, how dare she say - ""Or they might get silly ideas of getting independence,"" or fume over Prince Philip's family's association with the Nazi or Winston Churchill's policies and outlook towards the commonwealth. These are all events in history. They did happen. They haven't embellished or sugar coated it and have in several episodes ""quoted"" every historically accurate verbal discourse of various views on varying topics of the common wealth. As long as one remembers that these are all events from the ""Past"" and not how the world is today, we can actually praise the makers of the show for the portrayal of the Crown.Claire Foy has done a stellar job of portraying the young princess who marries Duke of Edinburgh at 21. For us born in the 80's, we've only seen the ""grey queen"" with no smile on her face. Seeing Claire Foy on screen, I had to remind myself that the Queen was once young and like you and I, had absolutely(well not entirely) no worries. The moment King George VI takes ill and things gradually fall on her shoulders we see her becoming the Queen.As a Head of the State she has done a LOT of unconventional things. She isn't as narrow minded as I thought and she has spirit and spunk.As Season 1 of the series came to a close and Season 2 began we see how the media covered her personal life and on the other hand when Churchill is more worried about Prince Philip flying instead of the crisis at hand we see how cunningly Winston Churchill turned the entire event in his favour whilst using the press as his pawn.The Queen triumphs in Ghana and manages to steer them from Russia and it is reported all over the world, thanks to the press. In the very same episode we see Jackie Kennedy's clothes stained with her husband's blood and we hear the queen gasp and say, ""That is deliberate."" I don't know if it is just me or if others noticed the gradual progress of how aggressive the journalists become. I believe it is something to look forward to as seasons 3 and 4 will have the Queen dealing with Margaret Thatcher and Princess Diana.I can't wait for the new season!My rating: 4.2/5
Recommend: If you love history but aren't into reading, watch this series. If you love history and love reading, join me in tsk-ing every time a certain bit is exaggerated.",8
"An Amazing Portrayal of the Lives of the Royals!","Let me first start off by saying that I am not a fan of dramas regarding royalty or political ambition, but wow, the Crown proved me wrong! The Crown is absolutely amazing as a show.The amazing attention to detail, the beautiful performances from Claire Foy and Matt Smith as Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip respectively, as well as dynamic and thought-out plots.John Lithgow's portrayal of Winston Churchill is amazing and he deserves the Emmy that he won for his work. The show uses his acting ability to perfectly capture Churchill's spirit and how he caused upset to his fellow politicians.The other thing that the show does amazingly well is demonstrate famous historical figures that tie to the Queen. The show does this very well and offers insight that may be different of how they are portrayed historically.Lastly, please watch the show! The show is absolutely amazing! The Crown stands on its own and it is wonderful to see so many creative geniuses come together to create such a fantastic show!",8
"Unexpected TITANIC GEM!","I was expecting this show ""for the ladies"", something like ""Dynasty"" of the past with Joan Collins.Surprisingly... wasn't at all! It's a well setup drama, a good biography, digging in a lot to the ""closed doors"" British Royal walls. The plot/story is great; Thxs God every episode is focusing on different character, like ""Band of Brothers"" did also and we didn't bored. Obviously, Queen Elisabeth is the ""main focus"" in every episode, but not so much. You have a character's story in every episode to deal with.The screenplay is great, the actors playing amazing,... I mean... wtf!!! I didn't expected this show to be SO GOOD!!!!They gave me all the DVDs (both seasons) together, I started this past Wednesday and... yesterday I watched the 10th episode of the second season!!!!!! I watched both seasons in almost 4 days - and be advised, each episode is 1 hr long!!!!!AMAZING show, start watching it now.I CAN'T WAIT till 2019 for the third season!!!!",9
"Just a comment","Does it bother anyone else that whatever the vehicle- MG TC, Rolls Royce, Jaguar or airplane, they use the same stock noise?",8
"Tiara Troubles (NO SPOILERS)","Although we tend to think that we know and understand this story because we've lived through parts of it and read about the rest in history books from primary school through college... there is, of course, a great deal we don't know. This series does a really lovely job of trying to capture the inner struggles of the new queen, humanizing a remarkable woman who most look to as a symbol more than a person. A young woman with such remarkably genuine passion for both family and state taking on such a great role with a mere fraction of the education that her father had received, for example, is something most would not assume about Elizabeth II. The constraints of her position are laid bare in the series, allowing viewers a better sense of the expectations and strict protocols that caused multiple fractures in her family throughout the years. Highly recommending the series, especially if you have time to watch the entire season at once (uninterrupted).",9
"Overall as good you could expect","Given the great exposure of and the general knowledge about the English Royal family, it was always going to be hard not to portray the individuals without occasionally falling into over the top characters over acting to get their point across.But it's very well produced and covers broad pieces of history, bings it can make it dull so best watched with a break between episodes.Out of all the characters poor old Charles comes off as the most dislikable, if 50% true, he's got a lot to consider.",7
"NETFLIX why did not you age Claire Foy????","10 points for Series 1-2, 0 points for 3, that makes 5...what a bad decision....I lost interest after 1 minute watching Series 3, actually the same applies also to Philipp and Margaret...why not do it like in Benjamin Button? They were surely not thinking about replacing Brad Pitt with another actor-and were absolutely right. The aging techniques are surely even better these days, a huge disappointment.
Claire Foy is a great actress...and was able to make viewers sympathize with her, bond with her. Not possible with Natalia Coleman, she also looks like a 60-year old, even if she was like 40 then...
PS if I could I would give extra 10 points and 10 Oscars to Pit Torrens incorporating Tommy Lascelles...:)))), what an ingenious interpretation...",5
"Drama at its finest that lifts the curtain on the personal dynamics within the British Monarchy.","A wonderful production. It's visually gorgeous,full of glamorous gowns, astonishing jewels, elegant interiors and plenty of glorious vistas of countryside. At its heart it is the story of a family whose individual members struggle to forge a meaningful and fulfilling life within the tightly bound constraints of an ancient, powerful institution being the Monarchy and all that represents. Privileged and dazzling though their lifestyle is, the weight of history, expectations and restriction on personal self actualisation slowly crushes the youthful hopes and optimism of each member, with the exception of the Queen. The Queen is forged instead into a paragon of duty and discretion, cloaking a core of steel, placing the demands of the monarchy above her own and her family's personal happiness If this is a true depiction it explains the success and special reverence so many people have for the Queen and the fascination with the British Royals around the world. It also illuminates the bombshell that Diana must have been to the carefully orchestrated machinery of Monarchy. All this is brought to life by a marvellous ensemble of actors, each impeccable in their roles with Claire Foy as the evolving Queen mesmerizing, yet she is not the only one turning in an outstanding performance. I do hope there is another series and that the Character and motivations of Phillip is explored in greater detail as to my mind his position and royal role is the most challenging and least appreciated. The dynamics of the intimate relationships and glimpses of the royal routine and machinery are fascinating. It will draw you in. Outstanding",9
"Brilliant!","Overall, it's a tremendously well-written series with amazing period details, but it leans more towards drama than documentary or biographical work.The series became a real masterpiece, irrespective of how much it was based on reality because many people forget that it's fiction. We can never know how a closed-door conversation between two people took place in reality.The fact that season five and the first half of season six mostly focused on Diana didn't bother me as much as it did others. I also appreciated the part about the monarchy and world history, but I understand the high drama surrounding Diana's storyline. Let's face it, it was the same in real life-Diana's personality and missions pushed the royal family into the background. You could read and hear about the princess in every newspaper and TV show. This is exactly what happened in the mentioned seasons. Although Elizabeth Debicki was as magical as the Princess herself. Her beauty and acting were captivating.Actually, the whole casting was brilliant, and many of them looked alike... well, Dominic West never managed to look like Prince Charles, but even with the portrayal, there was obviously no problem in his case. However, he could not surpass Josh O'Connor's acting.Despite this, the show managed to frame the monarch's life in a very nice way, and as someone who didn't know much about the royal family, I really liked it!",8
"Love it!","I can't believe this season got bad reviews.. it's amazing. The actors are amazing.. especially Diana and Charles.Seeing Diana in pain makes me cry, it's so sad.Rest in peace Diana.",10
"Amazing","This show is absolutely wonderful. It's a well written drama encapsulating the life of the royal family. It's attention to detail in costumes and historical locations is something of pure excellence, that and together with the amazing cinematography. Not to mention that the intro of all things is also something of perfection.Despite me not being particularly interested in the royal family I watched this show out of the sheer recommendations from my friends and family. So thanks to them for sharing something great with me. I would recommend this to anyone as it is most certainly incredible.",9
"A masterpiece season one gives away to lazy clichés and rushed stories in season two","What I adored about season one was its restraint. When you are dealing with history and grand events, it's very hard to write a story that is not bombastic and all-knowing. That you almost have to forego knowledge of what's to come or you otherwise constantly have a nudge-nudge wink-wink to the viewer.What's amazing and very rare in TV is that the writers manage it in season one. I could suspend my disbelief, get caught up in the narrative and ultimately believe in the story being told even if at my heart I know it's a dramatisation of real events.The way the writers did this was have key events as markers to guide them, but they fundamentally wrote for the characters first. The interactions, the nuances, the motivations all stood up under their own right.Events affected the characters they built - they did not lead the characters. While events must have led the writers, they never let that be felt. I could almost believe that they wrote in a vacuum, then the real life events were brought in at the appropriate points. THAT is good writing.The cast and characters are rich and interesting. I can entirely believe Claire Foy as the Queen, she and the real Queen have almost blended into my mind. I feel like I'm watching historical footage at times. John Lithgow is a sensation as Winston Churchill, bring a humanity and fragility rarely seen in portrayals of him to date. The rest of the care are equally superb, each adding to a rich tapestry of the narrative.The production qualities and cinematography are fantastic, again adding the complete immersion of the time.The soundtrack... oh the soundtrack. You could argue it's over the top, but it's brilliant. It's stunning. It's evocative. And despite it's bombastic nature at times, it suits the mood and again complements the overall story.Season one is just simply brilliant.Season two, not so much.Unfortunately the issue I have with shows of this type and they resisted in season one, they started to manifest. The demons of historical storytelling started to manifest.The story started to play the characters. Subtly began to evaporate.They couldn't decide what key events to focused on - so they tried all of them.Now, as they move breakneck speed through the years they have so much story to tell that they don't do it justice. It almost becomes a bit Game of Thrones-esque in just running out of time.Now, story setup points are thrown at the viewer in order to justify the story doing what it wants to do.The Queen suddenly starts speaking extra formally and has a conservative haircut that Philip mentions - then suddenly you are embroiled in a story of the crown being old fashioned.The Queen is lamenting being middle aged - then a character later mentions her being middle aged.Flashbacks of Prince Phillip need to be put into place in order so they can then tell a story about Charles. Heavy handed dialogue about ""him being a father one day"" sets up the scenes that follow after.Season two isn't terrible by any means. You could argue, it's just like normal TV. Dare I say... ""episodic"" like it's a dirty word? But season one wasn't normal. It's sad to see season two broadcast its plot points so blatantly, in then order to justify its story. When you comment ""Why are they mentioning this?"" about a plot point then it becomes apparent later, they are not integrating the story in a natural way.The ninth episode of season two was by far the worst to date as it contained every TV cliche: flashbacks, foreshadowing, dream sequences... and some horrible plot devices. Are you in grief? Then you will do crazy things, like build a wall! This whole sequence is just bizarre. If it's true, regarding the wall, they demonstrated it badly. Humans don't act like this and it felt like proper TV nonsense. Then in a scene bordering on child abuse between Phillip and Charles, I wonder - is there any truth in this? The whole episode was lazy.And they want you to know they did their homework as they often end episodes with information about how history unfolded - they couldn't do the story justice so they have to explain it some more through breaking the third wall.Even the special effects go to pot in season two... due to lack of budget or over ambition. Sequences of the boat etc. are just terrible. They literally have a deck of about 30 people and it's 15 actors repeated twice, it's so badly executed it's insulting and such a contrast to the highs of season one.Season one as I said is a masterpiece. Season two isn't terrible, it's just lazy. It has too much story it wants to tell and it'll shoehorn it all in, regardless of good story execution. It'll be interesting to see how the season three reset takes the story.",8
"What a great TV series","The Crown is one of the best TV series I have ever seen, the storyline, the cast, the picture, the sound, the costume, and the set. Everything was so great. The main character which is Queen Elizabeth II has magnificent character development. Moreover, the set and the costume in the series are giving us the 90's vibes. In some of the scenes, the cast even wears similar costumes to the real events. Along with the set and the lighting, I would say that I love how they set the scene so perfectly. It is like we were back in that time. The lighting also, made the scene looks more interesting by depending on the situation or the mood the director wanted the audience to feel. Plus, the sound. The music background, sound effects in The Crown are pretty good. Importantly, the casting is incredible. They even look alike to the people they played. And with all those words, accents, and gestures, I can tell that they were trained so hard to get it. Although The Crown is a historical drama TV series based on a true story, I think some of the scenes were unnecessary. It made the show boring sometimes. As for the age range that I recommended is up to 12, I think it is because the show was based on real history and with the language they used, the audience needs to be really focused and concentrate on the show. If you want to learn some history and British accent, The Crown is super recommended.",10
"Exquisite bio-series is complex and compelling","One of the most expensive shows been created by Netflix, and it pays off in pretty good manner. What to say about the actors. Claire Foy is amazing and i am in love with her. All of the actors have acted beautifully. The show is outstanding in every way: faultless. From brilliant dramatisation to acting to score to cinematography: everywhere you look it commands. It is also compelling, well written, and well performed. In fact, almost every element is perfectly executed, which means that no single one stands out above the rest, but rather they work in harmony. And that is the show's greatest success; the fact that it all comes together smoothly into a neat, binge-able, high quality package.Besides all that, The Crown , have made me look with another eyes to the royal family, specially Queen Elizabeth, to be honest i did not know much about her personal life. Still the show is a fight of power money and above all to maintain the dignity of the royal family. Its just a must watch show available presently.",10
"Season 5 was amazing. Awesome detailing in every scene","Every detail is so immaculate in every screenplay..for instance in one of the scene where Queen sees the postal stamps and it shows the actual casts of previous seasons's in these stamps. Voww...the level of detailing in every scenes of all episodes was at another level.The Main characters were just amazing to bring that level of detailing. Elizabeth Debicki as Diana was just incredible, From the actual footage videos and the episodes she has done ,it looks exactly the same. That's incredible.I playbacked certain episode back and forth as it was that good. One of the best season I have ever watched.Waiting for season 6..",10
"Truly a Masterpiece EVERY Season","It is challenging to put into words how gorgeous this show is. As someone who grew up, not really caring about the royal family, this show gives new life into a story we all know. I started watching once Diana was introduced, as she was and is the most brilliant part of the royal family to date. I wasn't born during her time, but I genuinely feel as though she was too good for with world. Too Beautiful to die, to wild to live, and given a heartbreaking reality after being swept into the madness that is the monarchy. Throughout the season the casting has been absolutely stunning, every actor steps up to the plate and gives their all and we learn to love this story. I believe that the royal family has done a lot of damage in the world, and a lot of what they've done has created discourse, poverty, and unfairness for other countries... But seeing the parts of their story brought to life through this show, you connect with them more intimately, and find some common ground in understanding why they did what they did. The ridged tradition of this family sometimes is challenging to watch, but you start to understand why people adore this abstract life. I'm so thankful for this show- not only for the story but just for being brilliant TV to watch. It is rare these days to have such a thought out and passionate show with a cast that blows you away. In this new season, although we will miss Oliva Colmon immensely, I already know that Imelda will shine bright in this role. She is such a talented actress and we are so lucky to have her represent the next years of the queens life.Anyways, for anyone deciding to watch this show..DO! It is exdraodinary in every way.",6
"Colman did a Crap Job","Sorry to say but Olivia Colman shot the role of a lifetime to pieces with her incredibly 2dimensional and clunky acting as Elizabeth II. She looked like a deer in the headlights and fretted constantly.... about everything. Her voice was monotone, lifeless and grating. Look at footage of the real Queen at this time. She is personable, relaxed, pleasant. Coleman's Elizabeth is none of that. So disappointed with her performance and it just let the season down. They really should have just kept the original actress.
Helena Bonham Carter acted well, but really seemed a tad too over the top for Margaret. The actress who portrayed Diana didn't hold a candle to the real Diana, but frankly who could? Prince Philip was a great choice. Prince Charles was weirdly portrayed as more sappy than the real version. The Queen Mother was superb. Margaret Thatcher I thought was more a caricature of the Iron Lady.",2
"This just relates to season 5","What an absolute waste of time. Apart from Imelda Staunton and Elizabeth Debicki, the casting was so bad. Dominic West as Prince Charles was laughable. The episodes just seemed the drag on and on and mist of the content we have seen in a thousand other movies and series. I found the series hard to watch and engage with and ended up fast forwarding through some of most boring parts!I think they should have stopped at series 4 as this series is just incredibly boring, disjointed and too long.I loved all the previous seasons but I think movies and series about the royals has been done to death!Don't waste your time with this series!",8
"Good","My critique of this third season! Olivia Colman tried to do her best to be Queen Elizabeth II plus her and nervousness hindered playing the biggest queen of her career in a few episodes (Claire Foy played in Season One and Season Two she was at the beginning of the episode) and for me who saved this new season was Tobias Menzies and Helena Bonham what an impeccable performance of them! With the passing of the episodes I felt more lightness of Olivia (I'm not belittling her) I liked it was only halfway through the story but I hope the fourth season does not go through it. My grade this season is 7 out of 10.",10
"Am I the only one who sees that?","How come Margaret is shorter than her sister not only when they were young but in the last two seasons as well, but is taller than her sister in the third season?
Have the producers not noticed that?",10
"Top craftsmanship at its best","After finishing all 5 seasons of The Crown, I have come to conclude Her Majesty the Queen was the Crown and the portrayal of her in the series made me love and respect her even more for being the true sovereign and spiritual helmsman of the nation. There was also a bit of HK in the final episode which was sad for me to watch. The show is top craftsmanship at its best, especially in the writing and the production. Episode 6 of season 5 in particular shows the virtuosity in story structure, which begins with the execution of the Tsar and ends with an insight on how to find peace within the Royal marriage. Although when it comes to some of the castings of this season, there are some minor blemishes but I can forgive that.",9
"Paganism","Many theme's compose the narrative of this serie. Most of them are history-driven, romantic and character studies.
Bbtw, of the utmost sublimicy. This serie is unique in productional perfectionism. It's a straight 10, only because I can't give it an 11.But there is a darker truth in this story hidden. It moves through every philosophical debate or conversation in the story and can't be denied.
The musical leader at the beginning of every episode says it already in visuals; ancient gold transforms slowly and wisely into a modern crown.
The crown of England.During the coronation old priests and prophets are mentioned in a christian context. But the whole anointing-sequence can barely be considered christian. it's pagan to it's bones.The Queen in this story is young, foolish, wise, sexual, curious, daughter, sister and so on. But out of all that, she is struggling with one big issue that stands out consistently. One could say that issue is how to manage with her individuality and the role she has to play. But given all the references and hints in the script I would rather say: how to deal with the mysterious situation in which she has to be transformed into a Godess.The Crown dives deep into the old tradition of the God figure. The chosen individual who has to be the offering, the Lamb, spitted on and worshipped at, to support the growth of conciousness of the community. It connects this old power-system, to modern, enlightened, democratic, 20th century life. And hints that it's still alive and supporting nations.And what could Elisabeth herself say about all these ideas and assumptions? Nothing. She learned to be silent.",10
"Waist, The Crown of Britain is nothing but waist.","And more if one thinks about the difficult times Great Britain is passing through right now, with among others the pandemic of the corona virus, the problematic of the deals within Brexit, the border problem both with Northern Ireland and Scotland, the British people living in Europe, etc. And just think: what is the cost of it all for the British people, not only of the crown, but of the whole British aristocracy. I have to admit, I hate waist, so naturally I had aversion towards the TV series, but in a strange way it helped me to assert my thoughts and feelings about the monarchies, in this case, the British.
I mean there was after all some meaning when monarchs had power and ruled, but after Queen Victoria's death at the very beginning of the 19th century, the British should have realized that monarchy as an effective way of leading a country was gone forever. Instead, they created a rare creature, some virtual being that has only skin but no soul and no body and no brains; something apparent. It's a make believe in for the British. And in a coincidental and accidental way the series succeed in convening this feeling, in that weird way the series are good, unfortunately, that wasn't the intention!
There is no point in mention the many different scenes where this is more than evident; it would've just confirmed my assumptions. On the other side, the atmosphere and background are great, the same can one say about the actors achievements. The photography is also remarkable and most of the historic facts are surely ok, even though I haven't bothered to check because this is not a documentary. The direction has a tendency to exaggerate the personalities of the main characters by trying to evaluate them (or devaluate them) as Hollywood stars; that can be positive or negative, but I assume that for the most it must be a positive thing. I hope that when they see the series they can realize at last that as the Bible clearly suggests: ""All men are created equal"" and therefore there should be no need for something called aristocracy or ""The Crown""",10
"Funny","Olivia Colman is great in it. She talks just like Sophie in the peep show",10
"Que producción!","Un 10 en guión, un 10 en actuación, un 10 en producción.",8
"AWESOME!!!","The show coincides with actual history QUITE profoundly. In depth research is seen through out the episodes and series. I could watch again - like a FAVORITE movie. GREAT admiration is given to all of the staff who created The Crown series. Was much like visiting through a time machine and reliving or actually experiencing what happened. MANY thanks and applause!! The world needs more entertainment of this level. In everything seen in this day and age is 75% foul language as well as violence. Although this is what the world is mostly made of in our current time, MANY of us would like to enjoy what REAL entertainment once was.",6
"""The Crown"" ; lots of dramatic music involved","Seen the first 3 parts of the series. I have to admit to be somewhat disappointed. Camera beautiful, acting is nice although very reserved and hold back. Off course this is Royalty but it doesn't have to be boring and slow in a movie. (see: ""Elisabeth"" with Cate Blanchet; very dramatic and wonderful and yet Royalty ) What most annoyed me is the continuous music and at the most inappropriate moments when nothing really happens but the music implies otherwise. Rather confusing and it doesn't work for me.",2
"A bit of a hit and miss for me..","Season one and two was really good. The actors did a very well job. When I started to watch season three, I noticed that the actors was ""ok"" for the part, but they should've made the Queen and everyone else look older that fast. Season two covered the period between 1956 and 1964. Season three covers 1964 and 1977. The huge job in the way they all aged was too much. Queen Elizabeth was 38 years old in 1964. Claire Foy who played Queen Elizabeth in season one and two, looked 38 years old. If season three was supposed to start in how it actually all went, then season three the actress played Queen Elizabeth which was Olivia Colman was supposed to be 39 years old or 40. She looked way more older than her age more than in her late 50s. I also noticed in season one and two the actress, Claire Foy which played Queen Elizabeth has blue eyes, also the actress Vanessa Kirby that played Margaret also had blue eyes. In season three the actress that played Queen Elizabeth Olivia Colman has brown eyes and the actress Helena Bonham Carter has also brown eyes. That was a very notable change to me",8
"Pathetically Inaccurate Though Lavishly Produced","Much like the 1990's film TITANIC...Hollywood has lavished high production values to THE CROWN but little else. Any connection to history is non-existent and quite alarming.Made up story lines...especially the portrayal of Winston Churchill and his relationship with Queen Elizabeth...and with his own sanity as portrayed here...is simple rubbish. Churchill was a man of many quirks but he was no fool, had immense appreciation for the Royal Family and for both the Queen and her Father. There is no evidence Mr. Churchill ever belittled Queen Elizabeth or even would have thought of doing so...nor her toward him. So the whole premise of the first few episodes is simply idiotic...sort of a 'politically correct' rewriting of history from script writers who obviously no nothing about history.Sadly, NETFLIX, the producer of this nonsense offers an array of programming on its subscription service entitled: ""The Truth About... "" and then you can fill in the blanks about alleged documentaries on a host of subjects that bear little resemblance to the truth...but more of the opinions of politically motivated writers.If your goal is to brainwash a new generation of viewers...then THE CROWN would neatly fall into such a category. Sadly, TRUE HISTORY is actually far more interesting than the FAKE HISTORY presented here. Sure, no-one in this period of British history had a monopoly on virtue...but many had a firm grip on greatness and courageous action...and both Queen Elizabeth and Winston Churchill are among these.Maybe someday someone will give them their proper interpretation. You will not find it in this tripe masquerading behind amazing period shots and costumes.",10
"Lame Depiction of JFK, Jackie Kennedy, LBJ, Lady Bird","I think that the lame representation of those Presidents and First Ladies, calls into question the depictions of other characters in this drama.Though I'm watching other episodes and find them interesting, I'm going to leave this particular review, with no stars.",10
"A royal soap opera saga that covers all the emotions","Put away the criticisms about the 'accuracy' of the dialogue and representations of the characters and events portrayed over the series (4 seasons so far), and you'll enjoy this. The solid acting by so many well-known and lesser-known actors and actresses soon has you caught up in the storylines and events shown. The high production value (and costs to stage this series) certainly shows and adds to the 'authentic' feel of the different periods and stages of the various royals' lives. Each individual is given the spotlight and is allowed to show negative and positive aspects of their fictionalized personalities, for better or worse in making judgements about the 'real' people involved. Overall a very watchable show and good transitions from the various ages and periods covered. I found the heavy-handed inferences, comparisons and metaphors (real wars and family feuds in the same episode) to be a bit much as the series progressed, but I did appreciate both the humour and obvious gilded-cage reality that these people must surely get overwhelmed by. Not just the main royal roles were presented, but the supporting cast of sycophants, courtiers and politicians who were and are part of the monarchy were well presented and given prominence. Margaret Thatcher certainly hasn't gained any more sympathy after her portrayal in this saga, unlike many others, who will likely benefit from their roles being shown in a way that 'could' be true. Or at least human and not as uncaring as some believe. The monarchy is shown in a fair light and with the real queen's recent death, the future will be interesting. Will it become irrelevant or not? Time and perhaps this series will have some impact on that decision.",8
"Delightful and Beautiful","What a beautiful story of The Queen Elizabeth II. I have never been ecstatic about the a Royal family nor had any interest of their life. The Queen, I just though of as just a Royal figure. How we don't know about these amazing people who they are, how they are expected to represent their Church and people. The Crown brings you into their difficult and different life. It shows us how human they really are. The Queen I found to be a truly amazing person who loves others but is forced by what is expect by her oath to make difficult desisions where she can not choose love. What a charming, strong amazing women she truly is. I have new respect for the royal Family and The Queen. This story is beautifully created, wonderful cast, imaging and story. Already can not wait for the next Sean. Well deserved 10 stars. Just incredible. Well done.",9
"The Ultimate Family Drama, with gold-standard production, writing & acting.","Wow. I just finished the final season. I will so miss watching this Family Drama for The Ages, where we see World history woven into the interworkings of a family, which , like our own families, has regular folks, fools, heroes & lovers....but unlike us, their lives are scrutinized and played out in public. Their imagined private moments seem emotionally true & bring us into a new appreciation for all things Royal.Bravo to All who are involved in all six seasons. Moments from this drama will stay with me forever. Who knew Queen Elizabeth & her sister Margaret's youthful struggles would be reborn in Princes William & Harry's relationship? Who knew the legacy of the sweet young Lady Diana Spencer would still present as so painful and meaningful 26 years after her death?Fascinating too, is how the viewer is left to decide: should the Monarchy be dissolved in this modern world? Forceful arguments for both sides of that question co-exist in this intelligent and lushly produced historical, emotional drama. ""The Crown"" is indeed a jewel of a production.",10
"An Absolute Masterpiece!","This work is an absolute masterpiece! Tremendous soundtrack, elegant customs, and remarkable quotes. Shows how the queen suffers in the real life, and the difficulty of having two lives (Queen and wife). The feelings of the people close to the queen can't be described. It shows exactly the meaning of ""Living in Shadow"". I would say definitely one of the best 5 shows I've seen in my life. Special thanks to Hans Zimmer, and Rupert Gregson-Williams for the breathtaking soundtrack, and million of thanks to all the incredible cast.",9
"Well executed ornate bore","One of those shows you know is a collaboration of many talented intelligent people on every level yet you can't wait for it to end. The theme that is pushed in your face every five minutes is English traditional dehumanizes their royalty. Once the crown is exchanged the queen/king chooses a sort of suicide for the advancement of their national mythology. They are icons of various English virtues and this sacrifice causes them to commit acts of cruelty to themselves and their family. I have no interest in the royal family and less so after I was done watching 10 hours of this portrayal of their vapid lives. Elizabeth may be the least interesting character ever to be featured in a major production. She is charmless. Philip is an immature swaggering castrated lemur brooding about his loss of vitality and freedom. The actress who plays Margaret excels. The dialogue is dry, inhibited and bloodless. There is no action. Nothing of significance happens and even when it does it happens around their periphery. The ninth episode about Churchill is brilliant. while most this review sounds negative, this is how the writer intended it. This show is about a crown. It gets passed down from generation to generation. The people are insignificant in every way. They are bred to be bores. This show succeeds, it proves it's point, so bravo for a perfectly executed barely watchable splendid bore",10
"Brilliant","Enjoyed it very much. An excellent acting, great screen play",10
"Historical","Such a good season of the crown. Loved Olivia's portrayal and looking forward to the next season",10
"How Sweet It Is - Season 1","Well, that's how it seems to us but certainly not to the reality. Poor buggers. Not only did we get a birds-eye view of the royal texture but also a heart-felt view of their onerous existence which was not particularly pretty. And what a perfectly apt title, because this was not primarily about the Windors, but about the authority, duplicity and propriety of the Crown and how a courageous ""little"" girl came to terms with it and mostly stood her tenacious ground, whilst also, having to agonise deeply in her relationship with her despondent partner and jilted sibling. And as an institutionally, ill-skilled woman who only had perception and considerable integrity to guide her, it was disheartening to see this being constantly undermined by the Crown.This portrayal was so realistic you would think it was recorded ""live"" by the camera that Lizzie's dad gave her as a wedding gift, saying, ""I don't want you to miss a single thing"". And to our great fortuity, it doesn't look like she did! Now we can sit back and watch what really happened in those days as we grew up along with them (I'm the same age as peddle car Charlie). It's a bit like watching the Beatles anthology long after the romance has died down except that this was nothing we ever saw in the news. Brilliant, fly-on-the-wall view of a very private and much adored family, with 16 mm vintage cameras hidden, it would seem, in every corner of the palace and beyond!
The casting wasn't perfect (you'd be pushing shit uphill to get it much closer) but the way the actor's played out their roles put paid to any doubts about appearance. Notably, Churchill's pretender, who was the least look-alike of them, almost imbued his ghost so well, that if the real Winston turned up you'd think he was the phony. But the star for me was Queen Elizabeth who's pretender nailed it. And I was gobsmacked at how naturally Foy conveyed the nuances of the queen, especially in her canny facial expressions and verbalisation, particularly in close up.
Seeing our Queen in those early days was really delightful. ""After you darling"", says Philip as they make their way through the animal gathered grassland in Kenya. I'm chuffed. The whole, albeit short, Africa bit was stunning. 
I have come to greatly respect this queen, having now become aware of what she had to endure with so much more hindrance than help from those she ""trusted"". Everyone determined that they knew what was best for Britain, in terms of their own egos, whilst she, on the other hand, learned to know what it was, more from how she experienced it than from what her ego dictated.Dispersed throughout are some interesting reflections into royalty, such as the comments by Philip as they prepare for take off on his first flight, and Mary's conviction about, ""the Monarchy is a calling from God"", to mention just a couple. Oh yes, and Edward's comment during the coronation, about the monarch being uplifted to Godlike stature in the eyes of the people. Fascinating insights.""Eddie the abdicator"" came across as quite an arsehole under the self-seeking mandate of his Yoko Ono. Not being able to separate his own mind from hers, how on earth could he have handled the domination of the Crown? Britain dodged a bullet with his abdication. And Winston came across as an egotistical tyrant, who couldn't get out of his own notorious shadow. The scene of him being dressed down by a queen, young enough to be his granddaughter (almost), was absolutely awesome. He was never the same again and neither was I.A couple of misgivings. The reality was a bit overshadowed by the heavily melodramatic nature and I had a bit of trouble believing that Churchill could be such a sniveller. I just had to mention something!The Crown. So much bigger than all of them but it needed them just as much as they coveted it. A wonderfully told, tragic story, with a truly remarkable insight into one of the oldest offices in the world.One of the reviewers mentioned there was little drama or excitement in the series. I don't know what they were comparing it to. ""Game Of Thrones"" maybe. For me, it had an abundance of everything. Brilliant script, brilliant atmosphere, brilliantly acted human characterisation and an enchantingly accessible history lesson. All the brilliants in one series which is really more than enough for anyone. And if you can get so much satisfaction without a whiff of sex or violence, there is hope in spades for the British movie industry. Thank you.",10
"Visually appealing, it made me despise the royal family though","Acting is really really good. I love Olivia Colman especially..but I guess it is so well played and pictured that I have lost all my respect to the Queen, her husband etc. Their habits, attitude are absolutely disgraceful. I believe all people are equal and being born in certain family should not give anyone privileges. For me hard to watch (especially hunting scenes which I despise as well) but I got hooked v
It just shows an ignorant, sad family who didn't earn its wealth. A family which lives by ridiculous standards in a very very narrow minded world of protocols and absurd traditions..call me a hippie, call me an anarchist, I don't care",7
"Season 3 spoiled the crown","The first 2 Seasons are marvellous, the actress blended into the character and later on the show is losing its shine , with their selection of boring issues and dragging",1
"Propaganda at its finest.","The Queen is always perfect, never makes a mistake EVER. The Americans are viewed as fools. Making fun of our astronauts...",10
"The Crowning moment of television series without a doubt.","The crown is quite simply a masterpiece in every sense of the word and for me it's the best show i have watched since game of thrones.Everything from the cast to the acting to the music the attention to detail,cinematography etc is of the highest quality.Special mention goes to the Claire Foy and John Lithgow in their portrayal of Queen Elizabeth 11 and Sir Winston Churchill respectively they bring the characters to life like never before and should surely be heading the list of awards for TV shows in 2017.The show is like a magical time machine which takes you back to post world war 11 Britain and slowly transports you back to the present day leaving you in complete awe and appreciation of how the British empire had a profound effect on the world. The main appeal of the show is that it makes you wear the queen's crown and walk in her shoes and the most dramatic and gripping scenes emerge when she has to make very difficult choices sometimes even having to choose between her family and the crown. The series is a must watch it is both very entertaining and equally educative. I cant wait for the second season. Finally the show has left me with profound respect and great admiration for Her Majesty The Queen.",9
"Brilliant, a retrospective of simpler times","How they make the simplest events, and even unsympathetic characters so consistently moving. Brilliantly done",10
"A Tour De Force","If you love watching great acting, great dialogue and top notch production then this series is a must see. Claire Foy is mesmerising as Elizabeth, if Foy continues on this trajectory she is on course to become one of her generations greatest actors. I cannot fault anyone's performance in this series, not one and my only complaint is that it's finished and I'm left wanting more. Bravo to Netflix for making this epic and it deserves to capture every award it's possible to win.",10
"Hearts of Glass","I can't single out a favorite season of ""The Crown"" as they are all so well acted, produced, and edited.The steeliness of the royal family has been demonstrated to the public on many occasions. I'm sure one would have to be strong and impervious to criticism to be able to cut ribbons and host charity events as a career. You can sense the lack of deference to royalty in my writing now-I would not go out of my way to attend a ribbon cutting or charity event hosted by the current royal family members, nor would I have for any previous or deceased royal family member.I just now had to turn off Season V as the viewer has been taken to the basement where the Romanovs were killed, after their English royal cousins steeled themselves against any rescue.And this steeliness, with a complete lack of regard for royal wives, other women's husbands, and poor people who wish desperately to be their friends-they're just horrible people, and need rebaked with some humanity sprinkled in their souls.The idea of royalty is laughable today and no doubt I would have lost my head in centuries gone by, but why can't they ever surprise us and be admirable humans? And if mistakes are made, where is the true acknowledgment of the pain caused? It's the entitlement to causing pain that is hard to reconcile for the modern day person watching from afar.",8
"Very good","It's all very interesting and with amazing acting and direction. Although, there is an underlying current of raging communism, it's well done.",10
"The Royal Crown of TV","This is majestically the Royal Crown of TV. Everything in it is exceptionally perfect. The cast, the locations, the music, the outfits, etc. Every single thing about this Series is pure royalty and perfection.",10
"Great, entertaining show!","If you like Victoria and Downton Abbey, this show is a combination of the two. Fascinating information on how the power is wielded and influenced by politicians and church leaders. Add the secondary players fighting to get their voices heard and rise up the ladder. Great casting, with exception of JFK, and outstanding performances by Claire Foy and John Lithgow. I plan to watch it again and really look forward to season 3. The negative reviews must be from bots who are programmed to hate everything. Ignore them.",9
"Excellent!","For anyone who knows the history of this period, there is no spoiler in this review. I checked spoiler alert for those who might not.This is excellent, an outstanding series about Queen Elizabeth II. It begins with her intended, Philip, played by Matt Smith, being given the necessary titles to marry her. Season 1 focuses on the difficulties faced by the young queen with her marriage, with learning her job as queen, and with her sister's wish to marry, which Margaret was free to do if she gave up her title. I assume that anything depicting the intimate details of the personal lives of the royals is fictional, but it is easy to see how hard it must have been for the dashing Philip to live under the shadow of his wife who was also his sovereign. Had Elizabeth's uncle Edward not abdicated, had her father not died relatively young, had she become queen when she and Philip were older and their children grown, all could have been easier for them. But that's not what happened. The show is pretty close to flawless. Claire Foy's portrayal of Elizabeth is so real. John Lithgow is superb as Churchill at the end of his career advising the young queen. The challenges Elizabeth had in dealing with him was one of the more fascinating parts of the story. It's on Netflix. I highly recommend it. I can't wait for season 2.",6
"The change of actors is probably going to ruin the rest of the show for me to be honest.","I had only briefly heard about The Crown, not something that would catch me, at all.
Until recently, when my brother told he watched it. So i gave it a go, i must say, that i find it quite good, after all. Now i have reached Season 3, of the show, which to my surprise meant, they changed all or most of the actors from Season 1 and 2. Of course this is to visualize the aging of the characters in the show, and so it will happen once again for Season 4-6. But this is also where it most likely will ruin the show for me, not because that different actors looks different or are bad actors/actresses..Here is why:
1. Queen Elizabeth was 27 years old at her coronation in 1952.
2. Queen Elizabeth was 38 years old, in 1964.
3. So changing to an actor who looks like she is 58 years old, from the start of the season, where Elizabeth is supposed to be 38 years old. does not at all make sense!!! - This also includes any other of the actors. Also Helena Bonham - Carter to play Princess Margaret who is 4 years younger, than the Queen herself, I mean, u don't look like that as a 34 year old.I mean, You don't change appearance so drastically, within few days, weeks or months. So, i just can't. They should have opted for a more smoother transition.When that is said, What a lovely show, great portrayal of the royal family and all the events, drama and such, that has occured throughout the history of Queen Elizabeth's reign.",1
"......and we're done with this series.","I have been an admirer of 'The Crown' since it began and in this day and age of 'wokeness'. it was nice to see such an established institution like monarchy be shown in a balanced and positive light and the first three seasons did exactly that. However, deep down, I knew it couldn't last forever and season 4 will be known as it's 'get woke, go broke' moment.Season 4 is nothing short of a leftist hatchet job, not only on the Queen, but on Prince Charles, The Queen Mother, Princess Diana, Princess Margaret and in particular Margaret Thatcher.I'll take these instances in order.In the episode that Earl Mountbatten is murdered, the producers are happy to make a non too subtle comparison with the fact that all the Royal Family are engaged in their own blood sports at the time of the assassination to show that if the royal family can 'hunt their prey' the IRA was perfectly entitled to do the same. They continue to show The Royal Family as bloodthirsty monsters in the next episode as they all relish the anticipation of stag hunting.They show Charles to be a cruel neglectful Husband and Diana totally as the poor victim trying to adjust to a life she was in no way prepared for.The worst of it is though is the total character assassination of Margaret Thatcher. A divisive character she may have been, but the show totally ignores the good things she did and shows her only to be an ineffectual mother, an emotionless politician and trigger happy warmonger. In total contrast to the positive way in which they portrayed Harold Wilson in the previous season. The political leanings of the writer is on full display here.For the most part, they totally gloss over the victory in the Falklands in order to dedicate a whole episode on Michael Fagan, showing him to be just an innocent and misunderstood victim of Thatcher's Britain and the Queen chastising Thatcher for driving 'poor old Michael' to such desperate measures.It shows the Queen breaking with her role of a constitutional monarch and instructing Thatcher 'the racist' in to imposing sanctions on South Africa and the 'rift' that developed between the two ladies. Complicity throwing people under the bus to deflect from the leaked story.For the first time since it began, I have watched this series and felt like I was being preached at by a rampant leftist in every episode as he lambasts is with his own politics ideology. The balance is gone and in season 4, the Royal family have just been portrayed as cruel, manipulative, callous, bloodthirsty and corrupt.If this is the direction they intend to pursue, then if there is a season 5 and 6, then I won't be watching it. Such a shame as I thought they had something good going on.",9
"A gripping soap that suffers from the same issues all Historical dramas suffer from","The issues that The Crown (and all historical dramas suffer from) follows as such:1) Characters either don't age despite the passing years (e.g. The show 'Versailles') or they age terribly via recasting. The Crown suffers from both. Claire Foy was playing a near 40 year old Queen in her early 30s, and was hinted at as being old, then a year later is played by an actress in her mid-40s who doesn't even have Foy's eye color.The casting in this show can be a bullseye or so far off the mark it's unbelievable. Dominic West as Charles? Really? Diana is going to be 6'3 in season 5? Helena Bonham Carter in 2018 played a 34 year old? What?2) Invention. Rumors/gossip become fact, such as Phillip's ""affair"" with a dancer, or the creation of a character (Venetia Scott in The Crown, Jimmy in Boardwalk Empire, etc.) for the purpose of drama. Unfortunately, some inventions often come at the expense of living people and the uninformed swallow the hearsay as historical fact.3) The drama is made more dramatic -- less subtlety, and more theater. We have no clue what these people said to one another behind closed doors, but according the The Crown, whatever they have to say is almost always shouted. Another example is in the movie Frost/Nixon (there is a video on YouTube that compares the movie with the actual interview)
The one positive is that the Crown doesn't portray choreographed fight scenes like so many other historical dramas.Yet despite these issues, The Crown is an engaging story somewhat based on real events. To the creator's credit, he doesn't let his politics show: He manages to humanize Thatcher while showing her as someone detested by a great deal of England; the Queen is given a great deal of respect, yet is also a cold and indifferent mother who struggles to shed a tear.Is the show worth the investment? Depends. If someone can enjoy a show like House of Cards or Mad Men, then I could see them liking the Crown.",9
"Netflix Reigns with The Crown","First, Perter Morgan is a genius. His study & art of writing respectfully (whilst retaining his artistic freedom) is, as always impressive.The series is an insight into the life of the Royal Family, mainly The Queen & Prince Phillip. We see her as a refreshingly young carefree woman who ascended to the throne at 25. Her life obviously spun 360; and you see her transition. She may have been brought up to take upon these duties eventually but when she really takes on the role, you see her blossom, her strength, her faults, her unfulfilled wishes, her being torn between family & state.This series is not a rosy picture of the Royal Family, it is real, it is human. For the first time you realize that the royals are people like us; privileged yet nevertheless, LIKE US. ""Heavy is the head that wears the crown"" the definition is actualized through this series.The awe, the admiration you feel for the royal family here is also coupled with empathy & curiosity.The cast is stellar, from Claire Foy (The Queen) to Matt Smith (Prince Phillip), John Lithgow (Winston Churchill); these actors are truly versatile and embodied the characters with great sensitivity & finesse.The language, the mannerisms, the poise & eloquence.The mood of the series had that subtle pace to everything; it was typically British. No over dramatization. If you never acquainted yourself with the British Royal History, this series creates that curiosity in you. You want to learn more about the royal family, their vast history, their lineage & their personal tales of love & struggle.The Production of this series was just fabulous. The elaborate grandiose sets, the custom - made vintage costumes were well researched & designed. The locations: besides of course the British sets, I was intrigued by the sets in Africa.It's a refreshing take on history & I can't wait to live every decade of the Queen's reign through every season of this marvelous series.Thank you Peter Morgan, Thank you Netflix!",10
"amazing","to be honest I would never of normally watched this type of program.. not because of it being about the monarchy or anything like that.. its because I would of thought it was boring. not my normal thing. would I of been wrong.. OH YES. I couldn't stop watching this. it is truly well worth watching. Claire Foy (Queen Elizabeth) is outstanding and you can actually get into the character when she speaks. you feel sorry for her when you realise what she has given up to become the queen as well as how her husband was with her. you also learn things about the rest of the royal family and learn that they are just like us but in the spotlight all the time and even more now. as well as watching the government run their lives for them and not being able to do anything without offending someone. I know there will be another season of this program and I cant wait.",10
"Excellent entertainment !","Finest acting and portrayals. Lavish sets. Pretty good storyline too.. What more can one say ?",10
"Outstanding!","In a world where we often have questionable television, The Crown is superb in every aspect. Well written. The acting is wonderfully executed. The story lines and drama are well praised and great to watch. The Crown takes what can often be seen as a mundane topic of the Royal Family and tells the story with a fresh history and insight that has the viewer coming back for more. The Crown is indeed good television and deserves top accolades come award season.",10
"The Crown is not about people, but an idea.","The doubts about the historical accuracy of season 4, currently being discussed in media, are irrelevant. The series does not intend to display them accurately, otherwise the series would have been called ""The Queen"" or ""Elizabeth"".
This series is not about people, nor a woman or kingship.
This series is about the Crown.The Duke of Edinburgh says it to Diana in the very last scene - I paraphrase -: 'We are all outsiders and serve ""her"". We breathe her air'
Does he mean Elizabeth personally?
When Elizabeth becomes queen - becomes The Crown - she receives anointings on her head, heart and hands, an ancient pagan ritual in which a human being temporarily becomes the embodiment of an idea. Namely that of a representative of something ""higher"" In the tradition of where human consciousness is right now, this is called 'God', but it is in fact an occult principle. And with that situation everyone, including Elizabeth, is an outsider serving an idea. And no one is in charge.
The question that this series raises - along all historical or non-historical facts - is this:What is that idea?It takes craftsmanship to leave the answer to this question unanswered, despite the temptations of spiritual sensation or historical argumentation.That's why The Crown gets my straight 10",10
"Simply the best television I have seen in years","The series so far is a complete eye-opener and simply the very best television I have seen in years. The acting is superb, the scripts for every single episode I have seen to date (1-9) are magnificent and the on-location filming across the world is breath-taking. I had sat down to watch the first episode expecting a huge dollop of syrupy sycophancy, some sort of cross between 'Downton Abbey' and the innumerable series on ""The Tudors"" to which viewers have been subjected over the past few years. I could not have been more wrong and this is a truly 'adult' series in every regard which really penetrates like a drill into all of the characters shown and, in particular (as per the opening credits) shows how the institution of the Crown is like some remorseless machine crushing the individuality and personality of all those who come into contact with its heart. (One scene at the very end of an episode where Queen Mary appears in full black mourning (the very embodiment of death/the repression of life) before the young woman who is now Queen is a never-to-be-forgotten moment, but just one among dozens.) I fully expect this series will harvest numerous awards for acting, direction, script etc. (and music - massively effective use of haunting set classical pieces at key points) and fully deserves to do so. It has completely won me over to Netflix and, together with ""House of Cards"", means I now never watch UK terrestrial TV anymore and (with offerings of this quality available instead) cannot ever imagine doing so again.",9
"TV worth watching","Personally, I never cared too much about what the British royal family does or does not do, other than to share a certain awe for a monarchy that has existed for so long with people all over the world. I did have the opportunity to visit Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace once as a tourist in London. One cannot escape the imposing influence of those establishments, which, in real life, seem to validate years of history and stories of kings and Queens one hears growing up.But what attracted us first to the series quite frankly was the picture of Claire Foy on Netflix. We loved her as Little Dorrit from the BBC series of the same name based on a Charles Dickens novel. We thought we would give it a try. After a couple of episodes, we were hooked on the series, again partly because of this lady's excellent performance, but also because it is very engaging and really well done. Highly recommended! TV at its best in my opinion, well done Netflix for putting up the money.",6
"All-round brilliant!","I was so pleasantly surprised with this new series. It was all-round... brilliant! Brilliantly, acted, scripted, directed and filmed and and and all other 'brilliant' applications.John Lithgow (although way too tall for Churchill - who was only about 5'5) played Churchill fantastically! Great acting from him. In fact, I'd say he gave the best ever representation (that I've seen, anyway) of Churchill on film. Similarly, Claire Foy was excellent in the part of the young Queen Elizabeth II. Overall an interesting insight into the mechanics of the Monarchy machine, in which the government and civil servants have considerable influence on what the Royalty can and cannot do. There are a few 'goofs' I'd like to mention but as I can't find the correct location to submit these, I shall do so herewith.GOOFS Episode 3 * when Elizabeth refers to starting off her relationship with Churchill by making sure he knows his place, she mentions ""drawing a line in the sand"". This is a common mistake. When people say this, what - most often - they really mean is ""Draw a line under it""... i.e. end it, finish it. The act of ""drawing a line in the sand"" means 'giving a choice and/or an ultimatum. It comes from the battle of The Alamo in 1836 in which Colonel Travis draws a line in the sand with his sabre, indicating that those who wish to stay and fight should cross the line. it's annoying how this is used incorrectly.* When Edward and Wallace are dancing, they're dancing *attempted* steps of authentic Argentine Tango. This would be highly unlikely to have ever happened as tango, after its introduction to the US and UK, became clinicised, sanitised and made virtually impotent and thus into the modern ballroom form of tango. It is this - the latter somewhat impotent form of tango - that they would most likely have learned to dance.",1
"What a Blunder","The casting blunder in episode 3 reduced my rating from a 10. This new crew is largely dull, uninteresting and mostly unlikeable. If the producers aim was for the public to view the royals as cold, demanding, out of touch and superfluous they succeeded. Season 3 made the show distasteful.",10
"Great season 1 and 2. Season 3 cast is bad","Great season 1 and 2. Season 3 cast is bad. Bring back the previous queen",7
"A truly magnificent series","As someone who held no interest or affection for the British royal family I thought that this series was going to be totally boring and abysmal but boy was I wrong. The Crown is simply fantastic and is well worth watching even if you have no fondness for the monarchy. Personally I found this series to be completely outstanding in so many ways. The story is epic, the drama resonates on an emotional level and the cinematography is beautiful. Also all the actors involved play their roles brilliantly. I take my hat off to the talented individual/s who wrote this series, they really did an amazing job. In conclusion all I can say is LONG LIVE THE CROWN!",10
"Mostly good but quite boring at times","The episodes that focused on Margaret were really hard to sit through. I was bored to tears by this childish, ridiculous person as portrayed in the series. The Queen was played superbly, as always, by Claire Foy. It will be hard to get used to someone else playing that role. A good series, a solid series, but please omit more story line about Margaret. She is a boring, immature person for whom one feels no sympathy whatsoever.",9
"Inspired, enthralling dramatization of what went on behind the limelight","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSEASON 4After the political assassination of her brother Lord Mountbatten (Charles Dance) at the hands of the IRA, Queen Elizabeth II (Olivia Colman) must brave the dawning of a new age. As Britain elects its first female Prime Minister, in the shape of the divisive Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson), whose policies throw the country in to turmoil, Elizabeth watches as her son Charles (Josh O'Connor) strikes up a relationship with Diana Spencer (Emma Corrin), a commoner with her own free spirited will that throws the traditional royal style in to disarray, which blossoms into a tumultuous marriage that bears two children but becomes a desperate facade.It says something that I've come in to The Crown on Season Four, as being no royalist, nothing appealed to me about watching the previous three. However, the 1980s was a funky, transformative period, from the music, to the fashion, to what were then current events going on, and that made the new season look all that more irresistible. The show has been hitting the headlines recently, with some calling for a disclaimer, stating that it's a fictionalised account of real events, but in an age with 'celebrities' baring all in reality shows, the Royals remain elusive to the public, leaving any portrayal of them open to any wild speculation that can be dreamt up.There are many who cling to the saintliness of Diana, especially since her death, about her selflessness and compassion, and how she was too good for the snooty, cold royals (with some even theorizing her untimely end in the Paris tunnel may have been less of a tragic accident and more a calculated bumping off!), and this show certainly plays to that impression. All the more wonderful, then, that in one of three powerhouse female performances, Corrin captures her shyness and vulnerability so perfectly, while Colman fits the skin of the queen to a tee, and Anderson absolutely nails the determination and conviction of Thatcher.There was never a more explosive time in British politics and culture than the 1980s, and with such an iconic time serving as the backdrop, and with such magnificent performances, something I wouldn't normally be interested in has proven to be quite a pleasant surprise. ****",9
"God Save the Queen","I just finished watching The Crown..on my phone...it was beyond splendid!
My family and I lived in London twice...in the 1960's and again in the 1970's.
Every part was perfectly cast. The costumes...the sets ..the locations...spot on!
I actually remember watching the news reports from Wales, while we were in our hotel at the start of our first residency, after that horrific event.
The cast was beyond amazing...the locations splendid...bravo to all.",10
"Thought this might be my first 10 star review... but not quite","Wasn't going to even watch this as the topic wasn't of that much interest, felt like another period drama candidate... but it was lockdown and there wasn't much else to watch so decided to give it a go!
When I started I was going to make sure I watched at least two episodes just to get into it, but that wasn't necessary, I was on board after episode 1.
Only need a few superlatives to describe seasons 1 & 2.... outstanding! Everything was near the top or off the scale... plot, character, cinematography, set design, direction, attention to detail.... exceptional! Casting was fantastic, with the exception of maybe Prince Philip and the slightly weird facial stares.... but not enough to kill it overall. The Queen and Winston Churchill were easily the heros of these seasons! Seasons 1 & 2 are easily 10 stars!
Then came seasons 3 & 4, and I was expecting the same excellence... but it started to fall off the pedestal I'd put it on, ever so slightly. Actor changes weren't all for the best, though main characters were again deserving of the highest praise. But.... Margaret Thatcher was overdone, Princess Diana looked more autistic than shy, Prince Charles was more prattish, Princess Anne more arrogant and Princess Margaret more annoying than they were in reality.... so there were simply too more characters who were far too easily hate-able which send it off on a strange trajectory... in the end it left me without a core hero, which Clare Foy (Queen) admirably provided in seasons 1 & 2!
Still excellent, the Aberfan episode was one of the most moving hours of drama I've ever seen on TV, you felt like you were actually there, you felt the pain of the families and the community, simply outstanding directing!
But as for the rest well some episodes felt like they belonged more on The Bill than in The Crown, the Fagan one in particular was off track I felt!
Still the first 4 seasons are amongst the best drama I've ever seen on TV, definitely looking forward to the final 2 seasons regardless of any inherent weaknesses!",9
"Simply beautiful","It's rarely that I've watched a TV show that is so perfect even in the finest details! It's incredibly well documented yet seems to be quite impartial. The flaws but also positives of the royal family are well portrayed. It could even be a love hate relationship, at least with the queen. Sometimes you love her, sometimes you hate her.... But I think the royals are so rude nonetheless. Princess Diana is magnetic. So sad.",10
"Interesting","I have to say this show is not what I expected. After watching this, I'm surprised the royal family doesn't just look at everyone and quit. They're treated like dogs on a leash by parliament and have even less freedom than elected members of government do in other countries. I can't believe anyone, let alone a king, queen, prince, or princess, would ever allow anyone to dictate and control their lives this way. If any of this is true, I don't know how they can even stand to be anywhere near each other or how there hasn't been a recent war of the houses. For gods sakes, they're even told what to wear, how to do their hair, when they have to wake up, where they need to go every day, it's just horrible. And that doesn't even count who can they can or marry, where they can vacation, etc. Quite frankly, if any of this is true, someone needs to slap Parliament on their behinds like their nasty behavior says they should be. At this point, I feel rather sorry for the English royals.",10
"A beautifully-captured and compelling look at an important period in British history.","Visually The Crown is a treat - practically every scene is like an oil painting come to life. Fortunately it also has the across-the-board compelling performances and assured writing necessary to ensure that stunning scenery doesn't count for nothing.",10
"The 3rd Season is extremely good!","The scripts writers of this 3rd Season did a great job, some of the episodes are philosophically deep.~Prince Charles...his forever loneliness and inability to break himself free from the royalty bondage. After the episode about him, I've completely changed my bias prejudice about his later changes in real life.~Also, the interview between Phillip and those three pathetic and shallow American astronauts. It also reminded me that the Moon Landing might be just a hoax, since these three morons didn't even know how to lie through their teeth. They were just some helpless puppets to be manipulated during the Cold War. What a joke!~Phillip's mother, the nun.....what a sad story about a woman during her chaotic life. I was deeply moved by her final days in the palace. The actor is such an appropriate and wonderful cast.~The forever tragic role of Margret. Her self-abject and self-indulgent behaviors in her life seem to become quite acceptable and understandable.~The Queen herself....also a tragic person fatally doomed by the ridiculous British hierarchy.Thank God, the Phillip role has been appropriately replaced; the actor who played that role in the last two seasons was such a disaster!",7
"S1 & 2 were 10 stars - S3 took a turn","I thought a long time before writing this review. I struggle giving the series an overall star rating because seasons 1&2 were so amazing but season 3 is so lacking.Everyone has commented on the actor changes and yes this does impact the characters slightly. But I feel there is a deeper disconnect in this 3rd season. It's really about the writing, storyline and perspective.Seasons 1 & 2 gave us beautiful haunting insight into WHY each of the royal members were the way they were. We subtly saw how they struggled and the ways they found their own selves to be lacking. Insecurities, combined with explanation of how each were restricted and stiffled by their role and duties combined to create characters that even if you didn't like you UNDERSTOOD.Claire Foy was amazing. She gave the queen a glimpse of a backbone, a desire to learn and be better, and the storylines led us to infer that while her hands were legally tied from much impact that she had interest and concern about the country.This 3rd season was written, directed and portrayed in the opposite manner. Scenes are laid out to make the royals act snobbish - even discourteous - to their servants and guests. The queen is written to be not only ignorant due to a lack of schooling but also completely void of interest in knowing ANYTHING. She is played to be flaky, unfeeling, dense and completely ineffective. I understand that part of the story cover years where popular thinking questioned the purpose of the royal family. If this had been tackled in S1 or 2 we would have seen each character's struggle with it and felt for them. As it is in S3 it seems like they don't even feel they are relevant themselves.We've been pampered by the writing and acting in the first 2 seasons. It was a realistic and raw love story to the time and the monarchy. This season is simply a boring flat flop bashing the institution. Weird twist.",1
"No more beautiful Claire Foy...............","I enjoy Olivia Coleman, I do. I really do. But NOT as THE Queen, HRH on 'The Crown'. I have watched oh maybe 45 seconds, well however long it takes for the stamp debacle. NO, NO, NO I ABSOLUTELY REFUSE to believe that Netflix cannot or would not hire a talented makeup artist to GRACEFULLY age gorgeous and very, very talented Claire Foy. I just really do not think I can watch any longer. HUGE MISTAKE Netflix - HUGE MISTAKE. It is painful and so disappointing.
No stiff upper lip for this Yankee. Claire Foy, please and thank you and all that Tommy Rot. Not going to watch. Bobs your uncle, DONE.",8
"Awestruck","I am delighted to have started this series. I have enjoyed Claire Foy in Little Dorrit and the excellent Wolf Hall. She does not disappoint here and must be one of the brightest actresses around. She is a visual marvel.Eileen Atkins as Queen Mary is the most profound thing I have seen on a screen for a long time. Her description of the monarch's responsibility before God to inspire the people is itself an inspiration. I have more sympathy for Queen Elizabeth's position during the post-war social revolution we are still living through. The hardest thing is to do nothing.The series makes one vividly experience history. I mourned the passing of our wartime King. The portrayal of Churchill our national hero, is excellent and I am reminded of the machinations around Thatcher as Eden and other cabinet members look to oust the great man. At episode six and look forward to the rest of the series.",8
"Prince Philip","This is a very good production but Matt Smith as Prince Philip is very poor. I have never known a naval officer with such low self esteem that he gets about with head bowed and looking through his eyebrows! This was the look of Princess Diana. Philip is a much more confident man and not the miserable person depicted.",10
"Good but spoiled by miscasting","This is a wonderfully filmed filmed program which stays fairly close to historical accuracy.The actors all do a good job but the badly matched similarities to such well known figures tends to distract from their performances.John Lithgow does a good job but he is no Churchill. Much the same with the King. To be fair most of the other cast do look and sound like they should.Such a shame, but nonetheless a very good series.But please do not let these small distractions (which may well be only my own) stop you from enjoying, what is a very well produced piece of historical drama.",10
"Top 3","One of the best shows ever period .Breaking bad
True detective season 1
The crown
Are in a different league
Pinnacle of tv dram series
🙌🙏
The changing of actors in every season to show different timelines is a great achievement in keeping
The time lines brilliant
With each passing season it's apt to say
The change of guards is equivalent to change of actors
Each character is very well written .This might be the best British television series to come out in a longtime .The music is unbelievable. Hans zimmer proves why he is the best in original music score soundtrack.The research and theory done is absolutely magnificentPlease watch it and make this show as a benchmark for your tv viewing .",8
"The show was entertaining and educational in its truths, however I have two issues I have.are 1: she use to be kind 2she should've stepped down for prince Charles yrs ago.","At first the queen seemed timid, unsure but caring for her sister and family. Now she STILL behaves like someone is stealing the spotlight! Prince Charles deserved to be king a long time ago and she should've stepped down so he could reign, now yrs have passed where he's been denied that. It saddens me. I respect the crown, monarchy and tradition but she's had her time, and has delayed his. We will be lucky to see him reign long or even at all.",10
"Not Diana","The Crown is one of my favourite shows and up til now they have done fairly well with the casting but they have got it wrong with the actor playing Diana.. she is nothing like her and is carrying the head to the side affectation too far.. yes Diana did that but not to the extent shown in series 4... this actor has spoiled the show for me .",8
"Kathleen Turner","In the pic shown above from ""The Crown"", whoever she is, she looks exactly like Kathleen Turner. Your",9
"This is a very interesting show","This show seems fairly accurate re history. Performances are excellent. Only criticism I would have is actors who play the Kennedys don't look Anything like them. Horrible casting. Maybe that's their slam to us yanks since they don't like us!! Shame on them for not making them look more accurate.",6
"Takes the Crown","Well written script, makes you want to learn more about the British Royalty. Good insight into their lives. Gives the royalty some colour. Love the attention to detail of the costumes and setups. Keeps you wanting more.",1
"just...boring","Okay, so my disclaimer is that I've only watched about a season and a half of this show. However, I think that can provide a perfectly fair assessment. If you're only eligible to review shows that you've watch in their entirety, reviews will skew positive because those who don't enjoy the show likely won't continue watching.Moving on. The production value (what does that phrase really mean...I sound like Netflix when they call every other show ""cerebral"") is noticeable. The costumes and sets (Buckingham palace!!!) are beautiful, and seem to be of the period, without coming off like a tv show set. I even think they did a good job training actors' accents to exude royalty. Claire Foy is perfect as the queen, and the rest of the cast does a great job embodying the smugness of the royal family.Acting and design aside, the story was boring. In fact, because the actors did their jobs so well- becoming the royals- I did not care to learn more about their lives. None of the characters were sympathetic to me. As hard as the show tries to make my like Winston Churchill, he continued to infuriate me. Same goes for the queen, who is already a boring personality to begin with. If you're a history nerd or you like the royal family, I can understand the appeal, but I'm not sure I'll continue watching just to see Margaret live her spoiled bratty life and Elizabeth become the ultimate #girlboss colonizer.",10
"Disappointed","The 3 season is really disappointing. I mean I know this actors but after the first two seasons a new actors looks so incredible to me. I was a real fan of those series and now just disappeared",8
"Not a fan of the royal family","This is well made and I liked the music in the soundtrack, but I must say I was a bit horrified by black people kissing the queen's shoes. Will this not offend people? I'm supposed to write two more lines, well, yes I liked the attention to detail, the costumes, Prince Philip comes across as a bit of a wimp.",10
"I like season 3!","Most of all, I am amazed that they had the guts to present the situation from all points of view...questioning, in each episode, the usefulness of the royal family. I didn't realize that they are so insecure, being afraid all the time that the English people might decide anytime they don't want to support them any more.
That the only joy in life, for the Queen, was to raise horses....
"" Do nothing, say nothing"" - wow, this is their motto, and they are paid generously by the people for that...to live in a golden cage and present "" smoke and mirrors"" shows for their subjects...",9
"What a historical masterpiece!","I've enjoyed the Crown, It's actually the first Netflix series I've seen. Season 2 was great and Prince Charles was the best part in this season along with the plane accident with Princess Cecile of Greece and Denmark. Season 4 was magnificent especially with Princess Diana was the best part of this season and it really moves of how her marital family had treated her badly.And Season 5, this is my favourite season of this series in general and the murder of the Romanov family is one of my favourite historical depictions of all time. I enjoyed the Crown and moving on with something similar like Bridgerton.",9
"In love!","Absolutely loved these first two seasons, not sure how I feel about a new cast for the third! A must watch if you're into period dramas!",10
"Great show with some really interesting characters","Really interesting characters with so what original story and with really good acting from some cast",9
"Excellent actors, high production value and a good history lesson","I started to watch this series while doing the ironing and I admit that when I watch it as the 'main event', I often doze off. Yes, it can be a little boring, even with the exaggeration and dramatization of events.I grew to like the young actors in the first two seasons and it took a while for me to get used to their middle aged versions. However, they are all excellent actors, especially Olivia Coleman and it is impossible not to like her as the dowdy queen who is quite complex underneath it all. I also warmed to the actor who plays middle-aged Philip, as well as Helena Bonham Carter's Margaret. Gillian Flynn's Mrs. Thatcher is quite entertaining, perhaps because it is slightly caricature-like.It's so hard to imagine what it must be like for these people to watch a series about their life and also that for the most part, the actors who play them are much more attractive (except for young Diana, who was prettier in real life).Update Season 5 and 6: I loved Elizabeth Debicki's performance as mature Diana! The actress is even taller and prettier than Diana was, but all her gestures and the way she looks up in a slightly slanted angle conveys very well what I imagine to have been the essence of the late princess' character (charisma and vulnerability). At first, I did not like Imelda Staunton as Elizabeth, because she seemed just plain rigid, unlike Olivia Coleman, who managed to convey complexity behind the rigid facade in almost every scene. However, towards the end of the series, I grew to like Staunton's performance better, especially when Elizabeth was planning her own funeral. I thought that those scenes were very subtle but touching. There are also lots of soap-opera like scenes in seasons 5 and 6, which provide light entertainment (e.g. How prince William and Kate Middleton met at college).",8
"To watch to understand","I really enojoyed The Crown with C. Foy, but could not watch with O. Colman. Think it was a mistake to change actors.Two seasons are worth watching because of the historical background, to understand, what was the monarchy in Great Britain and how it has changed. The Queens figure is amazing.",9
"Waiting for the New Season","You missed 2018. And 4 months from 2019 has passed and you didn't even scheduled season3 ?! Please inform the audience if there will be a season 3 or NOT",10
"Some people just don't understand.","I totally get why the director is changing the cast going through the decades. The reflection of maturity, experience and fatigue through the years is what gives the perfect touch to the seasons. The transition of the actors happened so smoothly that you don't feel the difference between the characters. I'm in awe to see so many great actors in one show. A masterpiece worthy of admiration.",10
"Dominic West does Dominic West!!!","I had no intention of writing a review until season 5 popped up with a whole new crew of actors. The major adult actors have aged literally 15 - 20 years in one year. The kids are still the same kids and only a year older. As a result, the visuals are very strange.Diana is pretty good, as is The Queen. The kids are still the kids, so they're perfect.But they dumped Helena Bonham-Carter as Princess Margaret and replaced her with a tall actress who has none of B-C's sass and vinegar in that tiny body.And then there is Dominic West who has decided that he doesn't need to incorporate any of Charles inflections - which made the original actor so BRILLIANT at morphing into Charles before our eyes!West does West.Season 5 - IMHO - is a train wreck. You can't believe what you're seeing, and it's not ""right"", but you can't take your eyes off of it.I had marked this originally at 7 stars, Season 5 chopped one off. And I might take another one away just for West.",6
"Season 4 reveals the writers' intents all along","Like most people, I was charmed by the first couple of seasons of The Crown and actually bought the DVDs. At that point, my rating was 9.
Season 3 was inferior in many ways, not least because QEII was portrayed as suddenly transformed from a bright dynamic monarch into a dowdy frump. So I began to be concerned about the writers' intentions as we headed to the most controversial period, during the reign of Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street and the 'People's Princess' at Buck House.
Now we're into Season 4 and the roof has fallen in. First we get the cheap shot about the Germans in the palace - they are no more German than they are Dutch (indeed the latter country actually existed at the time), but the royal line is really still Scottish, following the Stuart line that began with James I (VI of Scotland, in turn descended from the earlier Tudor line) and continued via Charles I, Charles II, James II, Mary II, Anne (herself the victim of a recent slanderous film portrayal in ""The Favourite"") and George I (through his mother Sophia, granddaughter of James I) and so on.
And since then we've had manipulation of facts and creation of 'false facts' (ie: pure invention, such as the letter that Mountbatten never wrote) that has all been carefully designed to develop a narrative that undermines both the royal family and the Margaret Thatcher (another victim of an appalling Hollywood biopic ""The Iron Lady"") legacy. For example, not even the majority of miners supported the political extremist Arthur Scargill and they broke away to form a separate union, while they got no support from the rest of the TUC and public opinion turned strongly against them when they murdered a car full of miners trying to break the picket line - yet the modern left-wing narrative is of a country strongly in support of the miners and hatred for Thatcher; pure fabrication!
I am hugely disappointed, especially following on so closely from the final season ""Game of Thrones"" travesty, and will not only not be buying Seasons 3 & 4 of The Crown but will not be watching any subsequent seasons (or any Game of Thrones spin-offs, for that matter).",5
"A terribly wrong cast almost sunk this great series","Matt Smith, who played the role of Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was definitely a horribly wrong cast, even the records shown that he was indeed a womanizer and adulterer when he was young, but casting this Matt Smith, with a long and narrow face, always slant to one side neck, street-thug like walking attitude, more like a clown or jerk instead, a cave-in crescent cucumber face always with a low class mockery smile-like sneer, and worst of all, such a terrible actor to play this important role, I simply couldn't hold myself too keen to watch this series and would tried every way to skip forward every time when he appeared. In China, there's an old saying: ""A rat dropping will soil a whole pot of porridge."" This is exactly what I felt when Matt Smith's face first shown on the screen. Boy oh boy, what an ugly dropping. Another ridiculous thing happened in the 1st episode was when these royal couple changing vows to each other: ""....For better or worse; for richer or poorer..."" Jesus, I just couldn't help laughing out loud! Do you really and seriously think these specific part of the vow could be appropriately applied to the first family of England? Their future could only be Better and Richer and nothing else, folks. So this was a practical joke to a commoner like me.But except this unfit cast to play this important historical role, this drama series indeed is grandeur magnificently made.An afterthought immediately after finished watching S01E09:If compare Jeff Daniel in ""Godless"" with John Lithgow, who played Winston Churchill in this series, John Lithgow should have won the Best Leading Actor instead in this year's Emmy's Award. The role Jeff Daniel's performed in Godless, in my opinion, was good but not great. What Lithgow had shown us is not only great but perfect. His acting talent is at a genius level. I just couldn't believe he was not even nominated at all.",9
"Never leaves you completely...","The Crown has many aspects which make it one of the best, if not the best Netflix series to date (my opinion).First: The Cast. Everybody will have their favorite characters but nobody can deny that every single actor delivers a close to perfect performance. Claire Foy and Matt Smith are amazing as the royal couple who's life gets turned upside down at the death of the Queens father. But the actor who pulls of the biggest feat is Jared Harris. His portrayal of the King and more importantly Elizabeths Father is so touching that his presence is felt even when he is not there anymore. Which is great and gives the story and characters a lot more depth and adds to motivation and sorrow of all the remaining characters.Second: Setpieces, Decoration and everything else needed to immerse you in this time is just superb.So if your after a character piece with a lot of emotions and a superb cast this is for you.",10
"Breathtaking television.","The Crown is arguably the most stunning television series to date. Everything about this Luscious production has been expertly constructed to achieve an end result that is flawless. The cinematography, from its glorious opening titles to the haunting end of of each episode, to the marvellous cavalcade of actors who individually put their own unique spin on the characters they represent, to the scriptwriters who draw each story arc in riveting and clever ways, to all those technical and behind the scenes crew who help build this series to its crescendo...I can only say thank you for such an engaging, intelligent, poignant, moving journey. Not only is it binge-worthy it is worth revisiting again and again.A unique viewing experience.",9
"Much better than I thought","Probably around 5 years ago I watched season 1 which I enjoyed a fair amount just thought it was slow at times maybe I wasn't as much in the mood. Im glad to be giving another chance as it's got every season available and Emmy's coming, crazy how The Crown has won 21 Emmy's so far that's outstanding! The sets are magnificent, brilliant acting, astounding directing, and more entertaining than I could've imagined. I've seen most of the best shows out there along with ones I need to finish, I'll enjoy getting through The Crown learning history of everyone involved. I'm sure this is one of the most accurate and well made series about Queen Elizabeth and everyone related to her. I'd recommend to anyone a fan of period piece drama's spectacular all around!",10
"Ranks With The Greatest TV Drama's Of All Time.","Astonishing on every level; acting, directing, writing and production. It is a masterpiece.",8
"Regal and Real","A wonderously scripted and directed political drama. The cast was brilliant and all the episodes in every season were very impressive. The effort that went into details of the set and props is appreciable and seemed very time relevant.I wait for the release of season 5 .",8
"Good but not very accurate","These sort of productions are not really my cup of tea but I was willing to give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised of how entertaining it was, good script,good acting,good direction etc etc but I really think they didn't have to have princess Margaret lighting a ciggerette up in every and I mean every scene. Yes we get it she liked her smoke, she was even smoking whilst riding a horse. Also when Mrs Thatcher comes into it,scenes where she's mashing the spuds and making the supper in Downing street had me in stitches. All in all though not bad at all.",10
"It's not the about the Glorification, rather realism of The Crown and The Royal Family","As the title of my review suggests, this series is not about the glorification of The Crown or the Queen herself, it's a story of the struggles, intricacies to hold the crown. It's about the justification of the Monarchy in modern times. The struggles of Britain, the interference of crown in it. The dynamics of the Royal Family. The sacrifices of Prince Phillip for Elizabeth.
Moving on to acting, every actor has done a superb job in essaying the role of the respective character. The writing was on the point, the dialogue exchanges between the characters were not the filler dialogues, just to fill the time, like many other shows, the dialogues are meaningful and have an impact on the story. The cinematography and the editing were amazing too, they created the Britain of whatever timeline they followed.
It's a must-watch series, must watch. I highly recommend it, trust me you won't be disappointed.",6
"It's okay","This type of show isn't really my favourite, I find it a bit too slow to watch and in the end I stopped watching it. I haven't seen anything past season 2 so maybe it gets better, maybe I'll catch up with the show but I don't know. From what I watched it was good, actors are talented and the visuals are lovely.",3
"Don't let the truth get in the way of a story.","This series looks good, is videography and sets are very good.Acting is OK too.What lets it down is that the scriptwriters thought nothing of being historically accurate. For instance official papers, released and available for public viewing, show that The Queen never tried to force her sister not to marry Peter Townsend. Indeed the papers show that an act of Parliament would be passed, if she wanted to marry him, that removed Margaret from the line of succession but left her with her royal titles etc. It was Margaret who decided not to marry Peter Townsend, after a visit to him in Belgium. But either lazy script-writing, or the desire to perpetuate a myth, gives entirely the wrong impression of what happened. There is enough within the long reign of The Queen that could easily be portrayed accurately and entertain us with a good story without the need to resort to tawdry misrepresentations.",10
"Season 1-5","4/1/2023 ✅ Season 5The high standard of screenplay writing set by previous seasons has been beautifully maintained - every episode contains double or even multiple storylines which seemingly developed separately but were somehow intertwined to emphasise the theme of that episode. Cleverly crafted.I like the fact that the Waleses' story was being told from the perspective of both the royal family and of Dianna, giving an impression of plausible impartiality. And in my arrogant opinion, Elizabeth did more justice to Diana's part than her predecessor.2020 ✅ Season 42019 ✅ Season 32018 ✅ Season 1&2.",10
"Caused me to read and research British History","Never had much interest in the UK or the Royal family and I couldn't tell you much about the UK except that Scotland doesn't want to be a part of it for the most park and my family genealogy goes back to 1670 there. I find it silly that people are calling for a disclaimer from Netflix that this series is fictional. It's obvious there is creative license being shared when a private meeting or behind closed doors events occur. Regardless of if it's inaccurate or dramatised after watching this series I've spent hours upon hours reading about the events depicted in The Crown. I never would have heard or known about Aberfan disaster, progressive influence to the monarchy by Prince Phillip, the great smog event, or Buckingham burning. I didn't find the last season with Princess Diana disturbing as I remember vividly the media reports and attention during the fiasco of a divorce, the affairs and her death. Overall it's a stunning series and in depth where one wouldn't consider than the then Prince of Wales learned Welsh not understand the significance of that, they could have left it out but they didn't and that's why this series is so good.",10
"Why change the actors?","Claire Foy and Matt Smith are amazing as the Queen and Duke... using aging as an excuse is totally BS as well because they have aged other actors in tv series and films!! I believe that after season 2 the Crown will flop and the only people that can be held accountable are the stupid people who made such ridiculous decisions!! Claire Foy portrays the queen perfectly and she is such an amazing and well liked actress playing such an iconic character please keep her!!",10

"Why I Love The Crown","As someone who loves anything about the Riyal Family, I love The Crown because I just love anything and everything there is about the Royals.",10
"the series stands as one of the majestic English series","After 2 seasons, the series stands as one of the majestic English series.
With a lot of budget behind that is noted in the staging both outdoors and in palace interiors to the changing rooms.
The level also comes in the interpretations where Claire Foy as Isabel II takes all the leading role. The plethora of secondaries are at the same level giving a coral distribution of an excellent level.
The direction on the other hand is quite constant and only stands out in an outstanding way in some episodes (Patterfamilias 2 × 9).
The plot so far dances between domestic and international politics in front of the intimate royal family. This is the most remarkable mistake that I see because although both parties seem more than interesting but the political plots I see a little worse for the overall high level of the series.",9
"Very Good Cinematography","Even though I have no interest in the royals or the lives of the uber-privileged (especially when their flaws are watered down and they are portrayed as a lot more amiable and good-of-heart than perhaps they actually are), I still have to give this show credit where it is due. Firstly the costumes, sets, lighting, camera work; all of these are faultless. The attention to detail (along with a huge budget) help to create a very realistic historical setting, which is sustained even as the in-series years progress. The acting is high-quality from both main and supporting cast. There are some historical inaccuracies and events which have just been made up to support the story/character development. I'm not all that bothered about this use of ""artistic license"" though, it's been standard fare ever since tv began and it won't change any time soon. It is an entertainment show after all, get your history lessons from books, not tv shows!",7
"The first 2 series were fantastic","The first 2 series were fantastic however the current one is awful.
Britain having it's first female Prime Minister was a step forwards, even more so with the head of state also being a woman. Yet Netflix portray them both in a bad light.... I get the impression that a man decided how they would be portrayed in The Crown.
Very sad.",1
"cast","Great series! Great cast! But.. you could have hired some Greek actors to play the Greeks!!!!!!",9
"History as entertainment","Very engaging show representing life of the British royal family since 1950s. Of course, not everything that was presented is true, but it what makes the show even better. You start to feel like you know everything that's going on behind the closed doors.",10
"A most Premier Movie","This movie is about Queen Elizabeth two where she is the heir of the crown after his father the king has passed away. She was at the age of 25 when she had to control a whole country and be the leader of the citizens. She had to overcome lots of obstacles and political issues at that point in 1940s. This movie demonstrates the 25 year old queens love relation and political power she undertakes.The Director successfully uses imagery and symbolism and Metaphor in the movie. The use of visual imagery gives the audience a visual feast. The Crown set as the main object in the movie is to symbolize power and royal ness of the Royal family. Lastly Metaphor was often used in the movie to compare The Crown as the Ground and Sky.I strongly recommend this movie to people who like Political viewpoints and who likes Queen Elizabeth and want to know more about this Royal Family.",9
"""In an increasingly complex world, we all need certainty."" - Elizabeth Regina","Exquisite. A royal & political drama in all its splendour. Each episode's cinematography reminds of a posh film. The stories unfold elegantly, accompanied by excellent music. Such impeccable acting, at the point where even vicious characters are, at times, likeable.",10
"Amazing","This is a true epic. The two first seasons are simply fantastic. Story, cinematography, acting, soundtrack. Just perfect.
I especially enjoy Princess Margaret´s and Prince Philip's stories and evolvement. Top notch acting!",10
"Simply Magnificient !","Wow! is just word for this Drama. I was quite concerned about the show that whether I should go for it or not since I was up to Game Of Thrones lately. I hope you are aware about the level of GOT series. Trust me! you won't be agitated. It will probably hook you up. So there is no escape one you are in ""THE CROWN"":
 an instance of amazing direction, Commendable conspiracy.",10
"Beyond Excellent!","The Crown series is simply superb. The acting, costumes, scenery and the music all make the monarchy come to life on the screen. The in-depth characterizations allow the viewer to feel compassion for the Queen and her family. The new actors in Season 3 never dropped the torch once. I'm excitedly awaiting season 4! Well done!",10
"Fabulous even with the flaws","Finally finished with all the seasons Just wished I had watched it sooner. Its definitly one of the best shows I watched since some time. The first 2 seasons were brilliant. I had just warmed up to the actors, and was not happy with the change of actors every 2 seasons. Yet you do warm up to most of them eventually.I do think all the actors that potrayed the Queen were brilliant. Also loved Matt Smith and Jonathin Pryce, Josh O'Connor as well, as the young Prince Charles. Although Dominic West did not look anything remotely like King Charles, he still did a great job. Elizabeth Debicki was spot on as Diana, the princess if Wales.Some of the episodes do drag. But they make up for it always. The build up that led to Dianas death was nail biting. Im glad they cleared the air on the accident It must have been depressing for the royal family to hear such theories yet maintain a sllence on it The last episode was very touching and emotional. Overall time well spent and hope we get a new season.",8
"A wonderful, brilliantly acted but regularly fictional Royal soap opera masquerading as truth. Enjoy it but DONT believe it.","Brilliantly done as a series but those who truly know the Royal family would NEVER concur with the characterisations (bordering on caricature). As a Brit I don't mind you implying the members of our Royal family have flaws as long as you also portray their strengths as well. The queen is warm, caring and kind and is very close to her children and grandchildren and NOT the cold hardhearted dour lady Olivia Coleman portrays her to be. Too much listening to Meghan and Harry 's whingeing maybe.
As as Brit am growing more annoyed as the series goes on. Not sure will turn up for the following series unless the next portrayal of the of the queen is more sympathetically approached. Hands of our Queen !!!!! Brilliantly acted fact, insensitively combined with fiction, inevitably produces ""friction""",6
"The Clown","The details are really good, the production is great, and the cast is not bad. Great cinematography, good details and costume design.The show itself started good, the first two seasons are interesting, dynamic and the cast works well by portraying interesting characters. The story itself is well balanced, the characters are realistic.Season 1 8/10
Season 2 7/10The third season is a bit weaker, but still good enough. Helena Bonham Carter is not a good choice for the role of Princess Margaret, but the season is still not a complete failure.Season 3 5/10The fourth season is boring and the characters are turned into caricatures. Margaret Thatcher is especially poorly made, she looks and talks like a cartoon character. The cast is sometimes good, sometimes hilarious, the series varies too much in quality.What seemed to be interesting, started to be boring and tiring. The writers clearly wanted to use this season to show how much they hate Margaret Thatcher.Season 4 2/10A really big drop in quality.After the disastrous fourth season, I lost the will to watch this series.",5
"Very well done","The first two seasons are absolutely phenomenal, Claire Foy and Matt Smith manage to carry the show and have a fantastic chemistry. Sadly, the next two are a bit of a letdown, while the scenery and filming are great.Olivia Coleman doesn't resemble at all her predecessor, in either grandeur or acting. I don't think she was a good casting at all, and while Tobias Menzies is a very good actor, he became very sidelined to the point of barely appearing, and when doing so, trying too hard for my likeness. Overall, the show is still good, but the first two seasons and actors are just too good.The best episode would have to be the one about Phillip's time in school and his childhood. Just superbly acted by all involved.Seasons 5 and 6 are back to phenomenal no thanks to the actors involved. Queen Elisabeth, Princess Diana, Dodi and his father, Prince Charles, Prince Phillip, all superbly casted - also a shout-out to the supporting cast. The acting, directing, cinematography, writing, drama, the grandeur are phenomenal. I didn't expect it to recoupe after seasons 3-4 were lackluster, but it has e very strong finish.Maybe Netflix's best show? A must watch for any drama fan, just superb and has some phenomenal actors.",10
"Excellent","A stunning tv programme. Well made (as with most bbc productions) and with a wonderful cast.",10
"Best docu-drama","Now, I don't know the history fully, but the cinematography and dramaturgy was on point. I enjoyed how they made the monarchy and the politicians all look like spoiled, close minded, faulty (human), detached, narcissistic people. Which, I'm sure, is still all true",9
"Every single detail of the show is marvelous","This show is really good. It has really good actors, who play the roles so perfect! I love how the producers found actors that look so much like the real people in their younger ages.The show isn't really thrilling, but the entire storyline is so interesting. You can really see a young woman grow out to be a good queen. This show shows you the good and the bad sides of being the queen of England.I absolutely love this show and I'd definitelt recommend it to anyone.",10
"Possibly the best ever but no Beatles?","This is so not my kind of show. I've been aware of the great reviews for quite some time but never could make myself to begin watching. Until a few weeks ago, that is. I'm actually glad I waited because now I was able to watch all 3 seasons without waiting. My ONLY concern? Not a single Beatles reference! Not even when they were knighted? So, I have to state: This is almost - almost - a perfect show.",10
"Amazing and intriguing","I have to admit that I am not the biggest fan of the royal house. I'm not a hater, in fact I like to follow new about them and I like the people. I'm just not diehard fangirling. But this show definitely made me love them more. It gives you more knowledge on how their lives work and how much has changed from the past until now. It's very detailed without getting boring and makes you see things from a totally new perspective. Personally I've gained a lot more respect for the royal family after watching this",9
"Drama at its best","Don't normally watch this type of drama but I am well impress by the acting and the writing hooked from the first episode .",10
"Well produced but endlessly negative","Having watched the whole series I admire the accurate study of the characters and excellent production,however I don't think one episode shows the Royal Family in a positive light,they do an immense amount of work to promote this country and that is brushed over. Spaces between the known facts are presented in a way that many will assume are fact and the Royal family would never comment to correct this.",6
"Season 3 horrible","Change of cast doesnt even give u the desire to watch anymore..",2
"so good","Ok for real this show is so good. It does an insanely good job at imitating real life, the actors' performances are so genuine and raw, everything about this show is just so well finessed. If you like history or historical dramas, this is an absolute must see. I'm honestly so glad people are making shows like this, just high quality entertainment that spares no expense to make it good for its viewers. Like thank you for real. You can tell it wasn't just something that was slapped together last minute for cheap views, which feels like everything these days. They make a cinematic masterpiece out of every episode and i appreciate that.",10
"Faithful to the history","The actors look the same as their real counterparts, specially Diana and Tacher. The story is solid as well the cinematography.",10
"A good show to watch","Season 3 started off disappointing due to the change in cast which left out continuity, something that is important to maintain. However, the new cast was equally good as the first 2 seasons and that brought about back the interest. Having said that, Season 3 script is not as interesting as it has many boring segments. Memorable acting from Geraldine Chaplin who leaves one totally involved and mesmerized by how great an actor can really be. Derek Jacobi as the older duke of Windsor gives a great performance as well. Olivia Colman is good as Queen but so was Claire Foy as the younger Queen.Overall, the cast has been well chosen which makes it all very enjoyable to watch.",9
"Loved","I just wish they didn't switch up the actors. That was really confusing.",8
"A big mistake whenfilming Season 4 Episode 3","You can see a mouse running by the floor!Check carefully and you will see ir running from right to left at the bottom of the screen frame.",9
"A peek into history, although with liberties taken.","Excellent cast for all the main roles. I've enjoyed these 2 seasons and hope that the next crop of actors can rise to the occassion for the upcoming season. Well done Claire Foy, Matt Smith and Vanessa Kirby!",10
"Historical TV making at its finest","This is a drama about life of queen Elisabeth II and is said to be the most expensive production of Netflix ever. And it really shows. The Crown has no big movie stars and no thrilling action sequences but the attention to details is marvellous. The show is a visual feast to look at, the cinematography, the lighting, the historically accurate costumes and locations and everything else show that a lot of money was spent here. The show is also well performed and well written. Every element is well executed, no one stands out above the rest. Its is just a very high quality of everything that creates a harmony where everything comes smoothly together.This is defiantly not a fast-paced and action-packed adrenaline kick off-your seat experience. It is a slow paced character based drama that is moving forward calm and steady. But it is very gripping and encapsulating.The Crown is one of the best period TV series ever made. It defines the quality of historic period film making with every aspect. Watch it. You won't regret it. You will remember it as one of those memorable television experiences that come along all too rarely.",9
"Awful decision to recast","Seasons 1-2 were incredible. 10 out of 10.The decision to recast for season 3 was one of the worst decisions I've seen in any show I've watched. The queen's eyes aren't even the same color. Sloppy.",8
"Actors change","Season 1-2 actors should of remained. Just wear makeup. The 3+ Season are so old and boring",7
"A Mixed Bag of Historical Drama and Racial Insensitivity.","As an ardent viewer of ""The Crown,"" I've found the series to be a captivating journey through modern British history, especially until season 6. The show's portrayal of royal life, with its intricate details and splendid performances, initially held my attention. However, the narrative took a questionable turn in the latest season.The speculative elements, particularly concerning Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed's relationship, were, to say the least, disappointing. In reality, their love was genuine and well-documented.The series, however, seems to undermine this by insinuating it was a ploy for Mohamed Al Fayed to secure a green card.This deviation from reality not only feels insensitive but also uncomfortably borders on racial insensitivity.It makes one ponder about the extent of influence the royal establishment might have had on the show's direction.The creative liberties taken, seemingly to favor the establishment's perspective, raise concerns. As a taxpayer, it's troubling to speculate on the potential involvement and influence of the Crown's lawyers in the making of this series, possibly at the public's expense.In summary, while ""The Crown"" started as a promising historical drama, its later seasons, particularly season 6, have been marred by controversial portrayals that seem to favor establishment narratives over historical accuracy.3/10 and if it had not been for the amazing actors and previous seasonsession. It would of got 0 due to the prejudice faced in season 6 by the writers.",3
"not bad not bad at all","Well i hardly finished season 4 was bit too boring, and actress that is playing Queen showed me excatly why i dislike monarchs' so stiffy and annoying.Anyway season 1,2and 3 were really interesting and easy for watching but last one not so, except parts were Diana was a main subject, she was really cool and a huge refreshment as for the series, im sure for that royal family too.Also must say that Gillian did awesome job with role of Thatcher. SuperbLet's hope 5th season is more about Lady Di than others :)oh and lady that played Diana was fckn awesome ))))) love it.",8
"Unbelievable","The drama is about actually how miserable it is to be the queen 😂🤣 For *ucks sake",9
"Went in Blind","I went in blind. I don't follow the royals beside Princess Diana and I didn't know much. This series was so well made that it felt you were with them. I find their traditions and duties interesting and can understand their life being about rules with no choices. It would be difficult for an outsider to understand if you didn't grow up in it. I thought the intrusion into revealing so much of their life was a bit much but when the public is paying for you to live in royalty then you owe the same people some inside. Double sided sword. They country doesn't need the royals because they don't govern. They choose to have them and could overthrow at any time.",9
"Second Chance Binge","This was very slow moving when I first attempted to watch it. I, for some reason, could not be engaged. Upon a second attempt, months later, I was intrigued, engaged, and loved the ties to true history in a changing climate of the world stage. If you ever sat to wonder, why is the Monarchy so revered, how are they still existing or even still relevant: this will explaining the changing tied. I felt a lot of empathy for the Queen.Beyond all that boring Jazz I just touted, Claire Foy is FANTASTIC as HRH Queen Elizabeth as is Vanessa Kirby, who plays her sister Princess Margaret. Good Lord ladies, please be in more everything! I don't really want to watch the season 3 replacements, I wish the show had budgeted for aging up rather than recasting, but we get the costs. We'll also see if the story can withstand a switch as audience grows not only attached to story but also to who plays out those stories.",10
"A Royal Saga Unveiling Secrets and Intrigues","I've watched the famous series ""The Crown,"" all four seasons of it. It narrates the life of Queen Elizabeth II from her marriage in 1947. The Queen, who sarcastically remarks about sitting on the throne, is still alive, while the one born to be the king is still waiting. Although the series is made in England, in some parts, it vividly portrays rejected royal family scandals.It delves into family secrets, the clash between human traits and the challenging protocols of royalty, and significant historical events where England played a role. The first season focuses on Churchill's pivotal speeches to the young queen, while the final season, captivatingly, revolves around Diana and Margaret Thatcher.With my passion for politics and history, I should have watched it sooner. Netflix released it in 2016.",8
"Well executed royal drama. 1st season a must-see, 2nd season a bit slow paced.","It's a based-on-real-life-events fictional drama, well executed, with care for the details. It has a good flow of events in each episode, usually not overstaying in subplots. That's season 1.2nd season runs a bit slower in pace and has a distinct change in tone which is not necessarily bad, but it most surely is dragged out in the second half of the season. Nevertheless, the show is a good one, so definitely give it a try.Third season is on its way and I'm really curious in general to see how they are going to portray Diana's story when we come to that.",8
"The crown","A relaxing series that shows the life of the royal family in a very convincing way. Great scenery, and some episodes, like the one when Princess Margaret met the photographer, represent real art.",8
"An enthralling drama","The Crown is a rising jewel of Netflix. This series is intended to have 60 episodes in six seasons, covering a decade of Queen Elizabeth II's reign in each season, and with new actors cast every two seasons. After a year long wait, Netflix finally released all 10 episodes of season two on December 10, 2017. Without doubt, this season of The Crown is magnificent. Although the first season, released in November of 2016, was a realistic and exquisite portrait of Queen Elizabeth's early reign, the second season far more entertaining. This season is full of life, humor, drama and passion. Although the truth behind all of it is questionable, it is irresistible.
Set in the 1950s, the second season takes Queen Elizabeth (portrayed by the brilliant Claire Foy) from crisis to crisis. From national affairs such as the Suez Canal Crisis and the Profumo Scandal to personal conflicts with her ever-disappointing relatives. Especially her whining and childish husband Phillip (Matt Smith), who is as much of a primary character as his wife. Prince Phillip is the love of Elizabeth's life and her main antagonist, continuing to be unsupportive, unfaithful, and threatening to disgrace the monarchy.
Claire Foy returned for her final portrayal as Queen Elizabeth. Each idea is clearly depicted on her face, making sure that we wouldn't miss anything. She can convey the message by a slight flicker of the eyes. Ms. Foy was truly amazing. Her counter part, Matt Smith, wonderfully portrayed Prince Phillip as a conceited simp. The performance of the supporting characters was also marvelous. The smug and ambitious prime minister Anthony Eden is played by Jeremy Northam. Vanessa Kirby was born to play the beautiful and wild Princess Margaret.
Season two of The Crown was wonderfully done. Each episode tells its own story, but it stays connected to Elizabeth's journey as a Queen, mother, and wife. I would highly recommend you to go watch this series. It would be an enthralling experience.",9
"I'd rate a 10 for Seasons 1 & 2, ZERO thereafter","Actually I stopped watching Episode 3 of Season 3. I can't believe Netflix invested so much money and allowed such bad casting changes that absolutely ruined the series.The changes, especially for the characters playing the two sisters were a complete miss and just blew the whole experience to bits for me.I really enjoyed seasons 1 & 2 and was in rare (for me) binge mode. I've read some ludicrous media reviews praising Olivia Coleman. Not only does she fall short filling her predecessor's shoes, but her demeanor, mannerisms and way of speaking are so unlike the queen's that it's impossible to overlook. So is Helena Bonham Carter as Margaret, since it seems she's basically playing herself with a brit accent. It's a bizarre experience, like having a rug pulled out from under you.What's even worse is the chemistry between both couples is completely changed. I keep reading critics saying what a great job Coleman does ensuring a seamless transition. They must have been paid off by Netflix. All I saw was the same character she always plays. Tobias Menzies is actually ok as the prince. But it's impossible to imagine the two of them interacting at all like their predecessors. In other words, when Season 3 began, it was as if the show i had watched for two seasons ended. Awful.",6
"More dramatical and doesn't sound completely true","Session 3- I lost interest because of new actress doesn't fit in the character.
Secondly importantly- they have shown royals as dumb which is highly unbelievable- England being one of the empire that had conquered most part of the world, was very much advanced in technology and civilisation- whose contribution is that- with crown ( kings and queens and discipline, it couldn't have been possible)The crown and the royal family should be celebrated and not to be projected as dumb",5
"Absolutely Brilliant","One of the best TV series. Loved it! Everything is a top quiality. Really enjoyed every episode, it's well written and well played. Would definitely recommend. I am not a fan of British monarcy and wasn't aware of most of the events in this series. But after watching this show I feel that I understand the royal family and their history much better than before. Well done Netflix!I think season 4 is the best so far. They did a great job with Diana and Charles story and loved Gillian Anderson as Margareth Tatcher. However, I think that original actors who played the Queen and princess Margaret did a better job than Olivia Colman and Helena Bonham Carter. Have to admit even though I love both actresses and was looking forward to season 3. Colman's queen is flat and lack of any emotions compared to young queen portrayed by Claire Foy. Same with princess Margareth, it's not the same person as in seasons 1&2, and it took me a while to get used to it. Didn't like both Philips.Season is the weakest. Probably because they changed the actors, but also because these actors didn't convince me that they are the older versions of the same characters.Anyway, hope to see the next seasons.",9
"Truly amazing!","As an American i absolutely love this series! A time when the world was great! This show always gives me the best vibes and I watch it often. The actors and acting is top notch. They really make you feel like you are in the era! I love how they showed several decades and later ages of the Queen. The music is also very well done. Really gives you that feeling of that era as well. I absolutely admire the British and their history! They were so vital in the growth of the world. Good and bad, it is all a part of life! I highly recommend this show to everyone! Give it a chance and I promise you will be happy!",10
"THE QUEEN AND HER COURT: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS","Lush meadows, rolling hills, ancient castles, spectacular palatial interiors: ""The Crown"" is a picturesque historical epic in which the visuals are almost as important as the acting. Make no mistake, though, there's plenty of fine acting here, from the ever-reliable Olivia Colman as the Queen, to--among others--Josh O'Connor as Charles, Emma Corrin as Diana, and Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher. We see Charles and Diana's ""meet-cute"" moment, and Thatcher's barely disguised distaste for the snobbery of palace life. We witness personality clashes, bloody battles with the IRA (brought to life with the help of some genuine TV news footage), and the Falkland Islands crisis. I'm a little tardy to the party--I missed seasons one through three entirely, and have only just begun to watch season four--but if what I've enjoyed so far is any indication, I can hardly wait to see it all. Question: is it possible NOT to like this behind-the-scenes, warts-and-all look at the royal family, from the Queen on down? Answer: it isn't.",8
"Too good to be true","In love with every little detail! Literally the best series on TV",10
"Insightful historical drama of the UK and the Commonwealth of Nations.","Very good and insightful historical drama of UK society and the Commonwealth of Nations - with drama and comedy going frequently hand in hand. So in my opinion, this is a very fine piece of television, exploring sensitive and delicate personal and political issues concerning the UK establishment.Very interesting portrayal also of Margaret Thatcher (Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher, LG, OM, DStJ, PC, FRS, HonFRSC) - being depicted as a very fine family woman and mother, who was also very emotional and feminine at times - the Iron Lady also sometimes melting at times, in this particular historical interpretation of the British stateswoman :)According to the series, also quite a few ladies of the royal family have affairs with their bodyguards - which is only natural, I suppose, since it would seem that both royal ladies and British body guards get lonely at times, and are in need of some intimacy and comfort. However, the problem seems to be that many royal ladies get dumped by their bodyguards - when they are transferred to another post due to their indiscretions. So this must change, I think. It is imperative that British bodyguards live up to their moral obligations - and do the right thing and propose to royal ladies after having had sex with them - so that their honour is not tarnished in any way :) So perhaps the British Intelligence Community can help out here a bit - namely MI6 and MI5 - and encourage constructive and honourable relationships between British Royalty and British bodyguards :)Interesting depiction also of the personality clash between Elizabeth II and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy - who apparently ridiculed the Queen with some unflattering remarks, while being intoxicated at a dinner party, telling dinner guests, ""that Britain's new reduced place in the world was not a surprise but an inevitability"" and calls Buckingham Palace ""second-rate, dilapidated and sad, like a neglected provincial hotel.""
So in the First Lady's defense, I would like to say, that Buckingham Palace was probably in need of some comic relief during that time - with Jackie Kennedy probably just instinctively filling the role of the court jester :) And of course those two fine two ladies later reconciled - with Jacqueline Kennedy and Elizabeth II ultimately becoming respected friends.So to all those fine future Queens and First Ladies out there - the future female elite, so to speak - this funny encounter between Jackie and Elizabeth should serve as a cautionary tale; that even though women's solidarity may pose a bit of a problem - and is very difficult to master - it's very important that future stateswomen rise above personality clashes, and work together, so that peace and prosperity can be manifested in the world :)The same applies to sisters - a personality clash also there between Elizabeth and Margaret - with Princess Margaret being instrumental to secure a crucial trade deal between the UK and the US in 1965; one that President Lyndon B Johnson had previously been reticent to grant; having refused an invitation by the Queen on the matter. Margaret's visit to the White House was, therefore, a visit of diplomatic imperative - a last ditch attempt by the UK to secure the crucial trade deal. Margaret rolled the dice when she flattered President Johnson and appealed to his sense of humour, and she won big. In The Crown, the dinner is shown to be an enormous, unreserved success. The pair are shown dancing together, singing together, laughing together and swilling whiskey together.At one point, Margaret and President Johnson start reciting some ""off colour"" limericks. ""There was a young lady from Dallas, who used a dynamite stick as a phallus,"" Princess Margaret jokes. ""They found her vagina in North Carolina and her arsehole in Buckingham Palace."" Margaret won the limerick competition with that scandalous little ditty - and thereby secured the crucial trade deal between the UK and the US.So here again, we have a lady of the highest pedigree - and contemporary of Elizabeth II - who instinctively filled the void, by taking the role of the court jester.In fact, Princess Margaret was probably ahead of her times in her role as UK ambassador; because diplomacy is certainly in need of some revitalization in this day and age. So diplomats and statesmen from all over the world can learn something from Princess Margaret's visit to the White House - her diplomatic success in the US being the stuff of legends - like Queen Guinevere and Lancelot of the Round Table, for example.On that note, perhaps US President Biden and Boris Johnson should also try something like that; to revitalize the special relationship between the UK and the United States - and finally get their act together in improving international diplomacy, and safeguarding fundamental freedoms and human rights in the world :)",10
"What happened here?. From respect to ridicule in 4 steps.","The new cast have ruined this production.
Seasons 1 & 2 were exceptional. Foy & Smith made the Queen & Duke relatable and inspite of their stiff class background they still showed emotional reach. The episodes were centered around key events in the timeline of the Royal Family.Seasons 3&4 is nothing like this. We have moved away from a diary of events theme into character assassinations of everyone involved and some obvious excoriating political statements.
Olivia Coleman has undone all of Foy's work her portrayal of the Queen is a complete reversal to Foy's and thus throws a huge continuity disconnect into the middle of the production. It feels like a different show altogether.The Queen now appears totally aloof to everyone in her wake, a boorish frump, a privileged bully with no emotion. The Queen mother is reduced to a laughing imbecile.
Bonham Carter does a reasonable job on an ageing Margaret although too much artistic licence has been given the pass over this character.
The rest of the family are portrayed as cartoon characters, exaggerating every trait until it becomes satire. Spitting image without puppets.This reeks of the Republican and leftist sentiments of Coleman and her ilk and Peter Morgan is determined to take the finale of this show into the direction of a political case for or against the Monarchy rather than wrap it up as historical fictional entertainment.Very disappointing and an insult to the Crown.",6
"Change of cast Ruined it :(","Loved the first two seasons but the change of cast totally ruined it. Why change the cast? Especially the queen. The queen in the first two seasons had beautiful clear blue eyes, then change to season three and suddenly her eyes have turned brown. The queen in season three does not act anything like the queen either, where as the lady who played the queen in the first two seasons did an amazing job. I've lost interest now :( I wish they had kept the same cast and just made them look older :(",5
"Now we know how Harry became so screwed up","Prince Charles is a piece of crap for how he treated Diana. He is a spineless worm who married someone he didn't love and then cheated on his wife with the woman he did love. They are married now so the entire thing only damaged Diana. I thought it was bad when it happened in reality and it looks just as bad on Netflix. Charles acted like he had every right to screw Diana over. I wonder what his bots think of him for doing that.",7
"Season 4 is a disaster","Seasons 1 and 2 were beautiful, Season 3 lost it a bit but Season 4 is absolutely terrible.
Badly over acted and completely ridiculous and stupid not believable situations.Lady D roller skating in Buckingham Palace? Really? Not even Hollywood enjoyable. Embarrassing.
The queen is portrayed very naive and boring. The worst character has to be Margaret Thatcher. So badly acted to the point of being ridiculous and very annoying. Terrible over all.",4
"Interesting and engaging in spite of the main characters","(Reviewed after Season 4).The reign of Queen Elizabeth II, covering her ascension to the throne, personal events within the royal family and world events during her reign.I'm not a fan of the British monarchy and my indifference meant it took a long time before I watched this. My view of the monarchy did not improve as a result of this series, in fact it worsened: the indifference turned to dislike and loathing. The amount of meddling, backstabbing and cold-hearted messing with other people's lives they're involved in, especially with those in their own family, is quite astounding. Probably the best example of this is the Diana period: the way she is treated was painful to watch. It also makes Charles one of the most annoying characters in TV history (he already had the face and personality for it).This all coming from a family who did nothing to deserve their position or anyone's respect, so it's all a bit difficult to be engaged by the main characters.Yet this series works and works incredibly well. The main reason is that the royal family are not necessarily the focal point of every episode. They're more a medium through which to witness British and world history. Each episode covers an historic event during that period, with some link to the royals. It's all quite interesting and edifying with the writers spinning an engaging story around the event of the day.The show takes about 1½ seasons to get to that point as before then it is all about the royals. Episode 5 of Season 2 marks the turning point and is one of the best episodes of the entire show.Some of the royal stories are interesting though, but these are a bit hit and miss as some are just plain annoying and demonstrate the level of malevolence they're capable of.This is not to say that some of the royal characters are not worth following. Princess Margaret, whether played by Vanessa Kirby or Helena Bonham Carter, was always interesting and when Bonham Carter takes over the dry humour gets cranked up big time. Wonderfully cynical.Similarly Prince Philip gets some great lines from Season 3 onwards, once Tobias Menzies takes over from Matt Smith in the role. Matt Smith was generally quite irritating as Prince Philip so the change was a welcome relief.On that note, the almost complete change of actors from Season 2 to Season 3 was interesting and initially a bit confusing, as I had to figure out who was who all over again. Not sure it was all necessary as some of the existing actors were okay for their parts could easily have been made to look older. Judging from the actors lined up for Season 5, looks like the producers are about to make wholesale casting changes again.Speaking of actors, this is another area where the show shines. The casting is spot on (the Matt Smith one would the exception) and performances are great. With such a star-studded line-up delivering such excellent performances it is difficult to pick a favourite but John Lithgow as Winston Churchill was particularly impressive (and almost unrecognisable). Jared Harris also gives a wonderfully gravitas-filled yet understated performance as King George VI.All in all, a very well made series and an interesting watch.Season ratings: S1 7/10, S2 7, S3 8, S4 7.",7
"Why would any British person want to watch this?","Here in Britain we have the Royal Family shoved in our face 24/7, newspapers are full of them every day. I really do not know why any sane British person would want to watch more!",1
"A highly entertaining disgrace to the royal family","I hate admitting it but this is a very entertaining show. However full of fictions and fantasies it may be. Americans who aren't interested in the royals will probably assume most of it is reasonably accurate but most of it is drivel, lies, innuendo and nonsense. It has to entertain an audience, after all, and the real royals are just excellent upstanding people who really aren't all that interesting without the press and correspondents making things up and trying to muck things up a bit as they always try to do. If this were more accurate to the truth it would be more historic but far less entertaining.",7
"Season 5.","My review refers strictly to season 5. There's no chemistry, none at all between the characters. Almost everyone looks out of place, badly cast, like they were on their way back from the market, and somebody asked them to play in a movie for a while. The script just doesn't do them justice.There was a certain continuity between the interpretations of Foy and Colman, now, there's nothing. That is a new person, who uses words like ""on bended knee"", and has far too many facial movements to express displeasure.The only one I enjoy watching, is E. Debicki as Diana, and the children playing the princes.It's a shame, as I greatly enjoyed the first 4 seasons, to feel relieved that this is the last one.",3
"Difficult to review a series as uneven as this one","Being right in the middle of season 4, I find it very difficult to express a global judgment for the series as a whole. I wasn't even sure if I cared to watch this, being not interested in the least in the British royal family.However, the first two seasons were intriguing and showed some unexpected sides of the family. Obviously, one should always consider that a good part of this is fiction, however, the feelings and behaviour of those involved are believable and there is a development of characters that make sense compared to whatever we know about them from ""real life"".More than Elizabeth, I found the characters and background of Philip and Margaret developed in a way that makes one almost - but not quite - sympathise with them. Philip was a sort of mongrel, second-rate royal, who grew up without the care of a proper family and ended up playing second fiddle to a queen. In a privileged environment, but still second rate all his life.The same applies to the abrasive and controversial figure of Margaret. Her dismal love story with Townsend seemed to have failed more because of her clinging to her status than for the meddling of her bothersome family. However, this point is dismissed in the series, with the family getting most of the blame.Finally, the Duke of Windsor saga is also presented in a somehow romantic light, but in reality, witnesses to the events claim that ""David"" was not keen at all about reigning and that he was clingy and weak and Simpson offered him a magnificent excuse to drop out of his responsibilities. He might have lived to regret it, but for sure his great ""love story"" was no picnic nor so great as depicted.After many historically charged episodes, the third series was drab and dull, with older Elizabeth by Olivia Colman nowhere near as charismatic as her younger version. Episode after episode of strikes, desperate miners and local tragedies, with grey and boring supporting actors, the only spark provided by older Margaret and her domestic crisis.Finally, series 4 started much stronger that the previous one, but being right in the middle of it, I am afraid the Diana saga will eat up most of the screen time.",7
"As slow as pouring cold molasses","Are you people crazy? What on earth is appealing about this show? My god is it slow! So incredibly slow. I watched 2 eps and seriously how are people giving this 9/10?This is a show about over entitled utterly superficial people who just happened to be born into the lap of luxury. John Lithgow sounds nothing like Churchill, Claire Foy is like a supermodel compared to the real Elizabeth and Matt Smith just reeks of smug. The acting is so drawn out and laboured. Every. Line. Is. So. Stretched. Out.I'm sorry but this is mystifying to me that it's getting such good reviews. Save yourself the trouble and skip this entire event. Dry, dusty, dull.Bad acting, boring writing and terrible subject matter. Makes me wish Australia would get its act together and become a republic already and cast aside these vacuous rich idiots.",3
"Great series! Season 4 is poor","This is a great series, very watchable. The first 2 season were great. The 3rd was very good, but by the 4th they are stretching things. The caricature of Maggie Thatcher as portrayed by Gillian Anderson was awful. And here I thought she would act. She made Maggie Thatcher look like a comic strip caricature. You can see the writers' disdain for Thatcher and the Royal family throughout Season 4.
Overall, I struggled through the 4th season, which apparently is more like a soap opera that the previous seasons. Emma Corin as Princess Di, and Josh O'Connor as Prince Charles really stole the show.Something and that was sorely needed considering the slow slow pace of Season 4. The writers also made Prince Charles look like a spoiled, love sick, moron, and were not too kind to the others in the family. While there are a Season 5 and 6 pending, if it is soapy like it may be a waste of time. Hopefully, the series will improve.",7
"Season 4 went woke","Brilliant Drama, but why rewrite history, I lived through the 1980's and The Queen was NEVER Political... Shame a great show is being ruined by the modern day wokes.No mention of Reagan, Gorbachev, or Maggies part in ending the grim Cold War... Just constant Maggie bashing, re-writing history oh the rest mostly about Charles and Di, well is the Crown I guess, if this show gets any more biased, I'm going to quit.",3
"A mixed bag","The first few seasons were terrific, well cast and beautiful to watch. However things deteriorated with Olivia Coleman portraying the Queen as dull and unfeeling, then Gillian Anderson (who is usually so good) giving a truly dreadful performance of Mrs Thatcher, aging her by 30 years!Other good points were Helena Bonham Carter as the totally glamorous Princess Margaret and Jonathan Pryce as Prince PhilipThe final season was so boring that I fell asleep a few times, and the ghost scenes were absolute nonsense! They should have stopped while they were ahead. A pity to finish a previously good programme like this.",6
"Characters cut from sheet tin.","Beautifully filmed and assembled to give a true feel for the time period as it has been in the past, this season disappoints in almost every other way. Why writers feel the need to overstate their political beliefs will never cease to amaze me. They suffer from the inability to control their emotions in the same way they accuse the one dimensional characters they have drawn. The lack of subtlety, charm or any other redeeming characteristic in any of these moving shadows says much more about the writers, directors and producers of this attempted hatchet job than it does about the obviously hated royals and the despised Margaret Thatcher.
I only pity the poor actors who had to sleepwalk through this farce. Can you hear the director asking for less humanity, more dreariness and portrayal of a general disregard of the royal's subjects?",2
"My opinion","The first 2 season were the best. Claire Foy was so good, her acting was Oscar worthy. Seasons 3 and 4 were good, not better than the first two but good enough to watch. Season 5 I feel is where it started to drop off for me. It was all about Diana. I get that her story is probably one of the most dramatic thing that happened to the royal family but it was way too dramatised. Most of the stuff that they show are so one sided it makes me cringe because I know that didn't happen like that. It might be controversial to say this but I'm not a big fan of it just being about her. I liked seeing the queen and how she became who she was and how her family impacted how she became the person we all saw but I didn't get that from the last 2 seasons. I will just say that they are both as bad as each other. But overall I think it's an okay series.",6
"Good up until season 3.","I loved this show until they recast in season 3. They would have done better to age the original actors. This show will never grace my tv again.",1
"Jumped the shark","Somehow, even though this is not ""fiction"", the series has jumped the shark in Season 4. The Queen is more in touch with the working poor than Maggie Thatcher? Good grief. Absurdity, they name is Leftism.",6
"What the hell Netflix","I understand the need to age your cast. So you hire a whole new cast. Did you hire all new writers who don't know how to tell a story?
I enjoyed the episode with President Johnson, and they did a okay job with the mine collapse. Other than that, I feel like I slept through the whole season!",2
"10 Stars for Season 1-3","This is one of those shows in which they should have quit when they were ahead - Season One through to Three was amazing - it loses a star on every season from that point really. I found myself skipping episodes that focussed too heavily on Charles, Camilla and Diana and even more so with William - the Queen was always the star of the show and I felt a bit cheated in every episode she and Margaret and to a point Philip were cast aside. And I have nothing else to say as I've already stretched this darn review as far as it will go but IMBD now insist on a certain amount of characters in order to submit.",6
"The series gets worse and worse with each season as in the image of the monarchy","After watching the first two seasons with a certain interest, I appreciated the connection of historical facts with the reaction of the mornarchy, the games, the carure, actors were up to the image of the idea that I I make myself of a monarchy, as much in the following seasons, the image of the actors devalued the notoriety of the monarchy, then we gently move away from the historical themes to go towards the ¨people¨, I stopped to see the continuation of season 4 after 4 episode, in the end this series becomes a matter of selling an image of the banal English monarchy, and who forgets how this monarchy influences the financial markets, forgets how they intervene in the economy Church and its Empire.
There is too much lack for this series to reflect this monarchy.
But hey, I would have been surprised if all freedom of expression was allowed, we have as always a beautiful propaganda documentaries.",4
"Gets catchy after first few episodes","Claire Foy and the cast are amazing! The story line is good, no idea how accurate it is. Given the intimacy of the supposed conversations, I have to guess most of it is fiction because I doubt any of the royals were giving interviews on their most private conversations.
Worse complaint, and it is a big one, is what in the heck is wrong with the volume? One minute it is blaring me out of the room and the next it is so quiet I am having to rewind it to figure out what was said. I have never seen such crazy volume jumping in a tv show! I tried using headphones to see if that would help and about lost my hearing, my left ear still hurts, after one of the loud outburst! I feel like I need to buy an equalizer to finish this... not happening. It is half ruining he experience for me though My left ear seriously feels like it is bleeding!",6
"Slow, Overwrought and Tiresome","I will give the positives: it is lavishly produced and at times quite beautiful to look at. Kudos to the cinematographers and cameramen. The costumes and historic sets are spot on. No one does period dramas better than the British.That's about it. Frankly, I was deeply disappointed in this series. I had hoped it would help to humanize an otherwise elevated group of people who the rest of the world only sees through the peephole of the camera lens. Sadly, instead of seeing human beings who we can identify with, we instead get dreary, one-dimensional characters who are about as interesting and self-aware as the stair bannisters they lean against.Claire Foy and Matt Smith, solid actors both, have zero chemistry together here; and even if they did have a spark, the Liz/Philip relationship dynamic is so flatly and stiffly written that it wouldn't matter anyway. Instead of seeing how Liz and Philip built themselves into the mutually supportive team we all know the Royal duo m to be,the script instead devolves into soap opera. What we get in the end area prudish wife who would have been a prude if she were a royal or not,and the usual staid, detached, disillusioned British husband who seems unable to find any sense of purpose in the life he signed on to. MattSmith is capable of so much more depth than what the script has allowed him.The same can be said about Vanessa Kirby. She is a fine actress, but her Princess Margaret here is annoying and one dimensional, and so unsympathetically written that it was difficult for me to feel any empathy for her or see her as anything more than a spoiled and petulant little sister and party girl...the 1950's version of Chloe Kardassian.And the list goes on. I could linger ad-infinitem about how much I ended up losing interest in most of these characters by the time the second season came around. Thank heavens for John Lithgow, who shows us all what a truly experienced and commanding actor can do to elevate a screenplay from sorry to passable. He is this series' one saving grace.The Crown is okay for what it is: a very expensive and lavish documentary. Just don't bother keeping the tissues nearby. You won't need them.",3
"Somewhat overrated","While is not terrible, it isn't as great as people say it is. In fact, it can sometimes be boring. There are many better shows to watch.The acting, though, is good and the casting is usually spot on.",7
"They got so much right but so much wrong","We've watched eight of the ten episodes, and the awful is gaining on the excellent. The production is sumptuous, but did anyone involved do any research on the Windsors? I don't recognize these people from the reading I've done, and I've read a lot.The Queen Mother is the worst. In real life, she was outgoing and enthusiastic, and understood that her extroverted personality was well-suited to her calling. She saw that she lifted people by her presence, and maintained a busy schedule almost to the end of her 100 years of life. Look at any photo of her. Her huge upturned hat brims were designed so people could see her beaming face. Read any of the notes she sent to friends and you'll realize that she would have been a hoot to hang out with. The actress playing her looks as if she were sucking lemons before each take.The Queen is a sourpuss, too, and way too tightly wound. I have known people who have spent time with her and the Prince, and they've described them as good-humored, warm, and down-to-earth.Most egregious was putting the dreadful Duke and Duchess of Windsor in such a heroic light. The writers skipped over their visiting Nazi Germany, willing pawns of Hitler's PR scheme. The Duke lied to his brother, the new king, about being broke, squeezing a big payoff out of the government. Having the Duke narrate the sacred moments of Elizabeth's coronation was disgusting.Really a shame. Five stars for the production, five deducted for character assassination.",5
"Season 3 disappointed me so much","Couldnt got used to the new actors. I am sure new actirs are the great and have a huuuge talent. But they didnt hit the point, didnt get the characters which were made with previous actors. Its too sad, really.. just why?? With such new technology and make up they could aged them((",6
"So good","Didn't like it when they changed the actors and it became really boring for a while but once it brings Diana into the story, it gets much better again and I love the accuracy they show of what she really went through and how they all treated her. She plays diana spectacularly. I actually feel really emotional watching her, it's like I'm watching the real Diana alive again. These series really show the royal family for who they really are aswell as so many things that have gone on in that family and what I've always known and thought they were like. I'm so glad they made this. Hopefully people will open their eyes to the truth of things now. Of course the royal family will not like this and deny so much of it because they don't want to look bad ""!.",5
"VERY GOOD BUT.....","Although the 3rd Season was quite good,I feel it was a very huge mistake to replace Claire Foy(as the Queen) with Olivia Colman as the former was much much better than the latter.It was the same situation with Helena replacing Vanessa as Princess Margaret as the latter was a 100 times times better than the former.However Tobias who replaced Matt as Prince Phillip was excellent.
All in all a very good series so far,although it would have been much much better if Claire Foy and Vanessa Kirby were still there instead of their replacements.
The persons who acted as PM Harold Wilson and Prince Charles were also very good.

"The fly fishing was done all wrong and awful","Spy rods on a little river being cast like horribly like one handed rods and tying the fly to the fly line and not a leader... horribly shocking.",7
"Seasons 1-3 fine, 4 not so","The first three seasons were an interesting view of an era and an institution you don't know. Almost like a documentary.
Season 4 allows me to validate facts with what I've seen and read at the time, and suddenly it's largely fiction. Not necessarily a bad thing, but still.
While much of the acting is fine, Thatcher's character this 4th season just isn't cutting it. At all... She totally misses Thatcher's cynical way of saying things, and constantly tries to pout Thatcheresque. In vain, misses the mark completely.",5
"Should have been about Margaret","Queen Elizabeth II's life couldn't possibly have been this boring. The series is a great touch up on history. Of course there are inaccuracies, but it does give the gist of how lame the Queen's life is. I suddenly felt better about my average life after watching this show.I think this should have been a Princess Margaret show. She's more interesting.The acting is phenomenal, which is one of the reasons I'll continue to watch this show. That and the fact that I already know how it all ends (light humour).I gave this show a 6 because I feel that the front woman should have been someone other than the Queen. She's so drab.",6
"A travesty","Is there anything more loathsome and irresponsible than a movie or TV series that turns history into a soap opera? How dare people reinterpret history as entertainment. Why, oh why do people see the need to twist history into melodrama in which the only ""truth"" we truly see is the writer's ego. This series is not about ""The Crown"", or Queen Elizabeth, it is about Peter Morgan. There is only one way to do justice to history and that is as a documentary. Yes, I know that may not be the blockbuster ""spectacle"" the masses want to see, but it is the truth. If you want to make costume dramas and visual feasts, do it on something like Downton Abbey where history is not part of the collateral damage. Superficially ""The Crown"" ticks off the main ""historical"" events, such they were. There was a Coronation. There was a scandal involving Princess Margaret and Peter Townsend. There was a great smog in London in 1952 in which thousands of people died. In that sense ""The Crown"" may indeed be ""historically accurate"". But to use these incidents as backdrops to paint totally hypothetical pictures of individuals, to literally make up dialogue people never spoke, to give them personalities that are pure speculation, to generate events that never happened, to blow out of all proportion events that did happen, simply to create the crises of each episode, is just unforgivable. If I wander down to my local library I will find a wall of books labelled ""Biographies"". In this wall I will find books that contain all that is known on a particular person. If dialogue is included it will be in quotes, and often have a reference, so the reader knows what was actually said. The author does not generally make up dialogue or create fiction just to spice it up a bit, or if they do it is quite clear it is the author's own views. This is what we call truth, and actually, as been noted many times, truth is often more interesting than fiction. If one were to try and publish a ""book"" version of this screenplay any prospective publisher would fall on the floor laughing. If perchance one was stupid enough to actually publish it it would end up in the ""Fiction"" section, filed under ""P"" for ""Potboiler"", just along from the Mills and Boons. Peter Morgan is evidently an extremely gifted person but seemingly an enigma. On the one hand he can write some truly breathtaking ""dialog"" when that dialog is impersonal, that is, it is expressing universal truths that really have nothing to do with the character. Then in the next breath we stoop to abysmal depths of ridiculousness/crassness – such as brave Prince Philip fighting off elephants, brainy Prince Philip telling his minions to put in a bigger fuse in his intercom system (who knew he was an electrical engineer?), and most heinously of all, inserting a ridiculous and entirely unnecessary character called Venitia Scott. Bath water coming under Winston Churchill's door? Give me a break. Mercifully this character gets hit by a bus fairly smartly – what a shame more of the cast did not share the same fate. If I can loosely paraphrase a famous quote from Winston Churchill (you will have to provide your own accents and cigars for this)....""Never in the course of human conflict, has so much money, been spent by so few, for so little good"".",1
"Slowly going downhill!","Have just finished season 6 of The Crown, and have to say it was the most ridiculous season of all.Whilst I enjoyed the first few series of The Crown (and I am certainly not a royalist), which was brilliantly filmed and well-acted, with some of the cast bearing a close resemblance to the actual characters, it seems that when the series was moving more to the more modern times, it started to get more and more removed from reality.In the last few seasons, the dialogue was clearly the figment of someone's imagination, with the final season being totally ridiculous, as to be almost unwatchable, the only reason I didn't stop watching, was to be able to have an honest opinion.As a production, brilliant in the beginning, again the same for historical information, as for being close to factual I don't know, perhaps is should have stopped a few series earlier.",6
"Disappointed","Until Season 2 I enjoyed this show very much and recommended to everyone as a very serious and profound work. But now I am outraged by absolutely untrue story about alleged romance between the greatest Russian ballerina Ulanova, who visited London and performed in 1956, being 47 years old, and Prince Philip. How come that the creators of the show did not do elementary fact check and so easily tinted the name of the most respected and world famous artist? They even have gone so far as to put some young Asian chick to impersonate the goddess of dance, which was just ridiculous! Why when it comes to Russia or former Soviet Union western movie makers create such hideous unbelievable stories? I absolutely lost interest in this show because how can I believe anything it tells us about the Queen and her family?",3
"The Eyes","As writers, we are taught that you mustn't make errors that will take your readers 'out of the story'. This could be, for instance, dialogue or action by a character that is out of character.
In S03 of The Crown, the mistake was made in casting. Both Queen Elizabeth and her sister, Princess Margaret were known for their beautiful blue eyes. This has been spoken of in an historical context. Blue eyes are dominant in the royal family.
So let's look at the casting. Claire Foy was perfect in seasons 1 & 2. Lovely blue eyes and that sudden smile that lit her face (just like the Queen). Not so with Olivia Coleman. I couldn't stand her as Queen Elizabeth in looks or acting, and I just couldn't overcome it. It took me 'out of the story'.
Helen Bonham Carter played the role of Princess Margaret well, but again the brown eyes.
I loved Josh O'Connor as Charles. Wow, what a performance! But those brown eyes yet again!
How was it that three out of the four main characters had brown eyes instead of blue? Totally absurd.
As were the storylines in some of the episodes. Clunky. Absurd. Terrible dialogue.
I enjoyed seasons 1 & 2 and looked forward to enjoying this season. Instead, I was so off that I had to write this review.",7
"Boring","I do not know why this is so popular. I really tried to love it, I adore historical drama and had high hopes. But this was such a snooze fest, the whole time I wondered why should I care about this? The main character appears to be catatonic. I did not get interested in any of the characters or their motivations or the general plot.I quit after 3 episodes, after I started to regret all the seconds of my life ticking away for no reason.Victoria on the other hand is the exact opposite, exciting, interesting, dramatic, fun.",2
"Casting is a problem","I find it hard to believe that in this day and age of CGI and elaborate makeup that the leads in this couldn't more resemble the VERY familiar characters. That there aren't enough show business people available to at least get the body types and heights correct. Claire Foy was way too pretty and spoiled-looking; Queen Elizabeth does NOT have the buck teeth and dimples of Olivia Colman; Helen Bonham Carter must have blackmailed the producers into casting her as a very chubby, dissolute Margaret. I'd rather watch a documentary (and there are many) of the royals because this show is probably just made-up stuff for dramatics.",6
"Season 5 is so boring","If you are going to create malicious fiction and unfairly slander the most famous family in the world, at least make it INTERESTING.Seasons 1 and 2 were great. 3 and 4 were okay while a bit hum-drum. But Season 5 is abysmally boring, bleak drivel. My 4/10 is the combined score for the whole series so far.Season 5 pretty much ruins a good run. Most of the storylines are pure lies in Season 5, but it's still just so dull.I cannot understand why any producer would create such tedious fiction when REALITY is that much more fascinating. It makes me wonder what the true purpose of this show is, because this poor result defies logic and reason.",4
"Seasons 1-4 shine, while Seasons 5 and 6 fade","Seasons 1-4 benefit from being further from memory and conjuring up the distant nostalgia of another era. Perhaps they gives them a pass seasons covering living memory don't receive. None the less seasons 1-4 are clearly superior. They're drama to be clear, this isn't a doco. But the drama is generally rotted in some historic fact, and the drama tells a story or portrays an inquiry into that fact. And always does the story tie back to the queen, to the crown.The same can't be said for much of season 5, and certainly not of season 6. These seasons take on a very different tone, a lazy recitation of what is known, coupled with uneasy manufactured elements. You come away feeling neither entertained, nor having gained any insight. Season 6 was always going to be a tough sell if it dealt with Diana. Why it retrod the grown more capably told in The Queen (2006) is a decision the creators should regret. Why it made The Queen and even Diana take a back seat to a fictitious soap opera of secondary characters simly infuriates. It's a sad end for a series that should have ended on a high. But then shows knowing when to finish is the exception.",6

It was disappointing to see the first episode of season III and realize that ALL of the actors had been overhauled...it just isn't the same.

"Audited by british royal family .. what do you expect","The show seems to be one of the PR strategies of the establishment we have come to know as the Royal Family. This is not new. In the old days it was newspapers and now its Netflix.
Every episode if carefully reviewed and audited by the Royal family before it is released. You will never know the realities of the part of the real history if you watch this. This is not a documentary as many people like to think that way.Three stars for the good acting and screenplay",3
"Somewhat tedious","Great historical drama series with excellent acting and magnificent scenery. But I couldn't help getting somewhat bored by the 7th episode. Perhaps this is because of the time we live in, where politic has nearly become a dirty word. Seeing the stifling atmosphere of the British Court and Parliament, as accurately portrayed as they are, makes me wonder if we'll ever grow up as a species. It sometimes feel like a theater play where everybody is a puppet on strings, pulled by some unknown phenomena. The King shooting birds, a sister who's life is destroyed, an Empire in decadence and a heroic prime minister who never knows when to quit, I was actually suffering for them. Yet, Queen Elisabeth elicit respect and comes through honestly trying to make the best of what freedom of action she has, helped along by a part time, cynical and frustrated husband. The sound environment of the drama is utterly pompous. I had to have my remote in hand all the time when any dialogue ended and the music rose up so much that I risked getting knocks on the wall from my neighbors. One thing I retained from the series is that being a king or a queen is much more a malediction as anything else.",7
"How to ruin a good series.","This was a wonderful program for the first 2 seasons, Claire Foy her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth was incredible and Matt Smith equally so as Prince Philip, and Vanessa Kiby was also excellent as Princess Margaret. The story line and scripts were all top-notch and it had me gripped throughout. I would have scored this 10/10Then came the dire season 3 which would have scored a minus if I could give that. The worlds most over-rated actress Olivia Coleman, who looked nothing like the Queen with her big cow brown eyes, gurned her way through her part, she looked 40 years too old, overweight and had none of the poise or grace needed and that Claire Foy had so brilliantly captured. She walked wrong, sat wrong, talked wrong, ate wrong and pulled ridiculous faces making her look more like a bar maid in a soap opera than the Queen of England. It is a mystery why Coleman won an award for this.Helena Bonham Carter was just as bad as Princess Margaret, had I not watched the beginning and just tuned into watch any of her scenes I would have had no idea who she was supposed to be, she also looked 50 years too old, overweight and lacked the tortured but fun loving person so wonderfully portrayed by Vanessa Kirby. I also missed Matt Smith's amazing Prince Philip and his replacement acted more like someone doing a bad impression of Prince Charles.As others have commented on here, why they didn't just keep the original cast is a mystery and will go down as one of the biggest casting mistakes in entertainment history. Apart from the awful casting decisions the story-line and scripts were dull and boring, after the first 2 episodes I lost interest and decided to watch to the end, in the vain hope that it might improve, but although I will keep and re-watch the first 2 seasons, series 3 will definitely find its way into the bargain bin in a charity shop.",5
"Some seasons are great, others are miss","I overall really enjoyed ""The Crown"". As someone who grew up with a monarchist grandmother, and also someone who is an Indigenous person who's life has been irreversibly impacted by colonization, I felt the series did a good job of being entertaining, creating empathy for the characters at appropriate times, and also being critical and poignant along the way. The first two seasons could be dull, but Princess Margaret's storylines were always interesting. Season 3 and 4 are really the pinnacle of the series. I also enjoyed season 5 and the first half of season 6, with Diana present (the actress who plays her is UNREAL, it was perfection) and the casting for Charles is wonderful. Really, most of the casting choices are just perfection and watching these characters age as different actors is wonderfully done.While I understand the focus shifts to William (in season 6 part 2) because he will wear ""the crown"", I felt like the lack of focus of Harry was deliberate and a let down. Of course I have great sympathy for the lack of care he and his wife have received from their family, but it really felt bizarre to leave such a glaring chapter out. The last part of season 6 is a BORE. They are trying to pack too much and it felt much more generous to the royal family than they deserved.Colonization has been such an atrocity to the world and I wish there would have been more care in mentioning it and pointing it out. No family should be treated as special or appointed by god. That being said it's entertainment, not education. I only hope viewers who are steadfast monarchists will be open to the criticism offered in the show.",7
"good","The camera work is stunning...the visuals will blow your mind...the pacing is goodi just feel like they didn't really do enough to get me interested...but that's just me...that shouldn't in any way mean i don't like the showthere are some parts that really blew me away...there are alot more parts that didn't move me in any waythe best episode I've seen is the one focused around Churchill...that was really good.",7
"Season 3. Such a disappointment!!","I loved seasons 1 & 2. Amazing cast. Season 3 has been a huge disappointment with casting. Olivia Coleman is just terrible as the Queen. Painful to watch her. Helena Bonham Carter as Margaret was another poor casting choice.
I made through all of season 3 but it was a stretch.
Too bad the casting was so horrible.",1
"Fairytale vs Reality","Young, beautiful actors portraying a fairy tale in the glamorous 50s versus grounded, aged actors striking a tad closer to reality in the 60s. Everything changes in season 3. Not only the cast, but also the writing, lighting, color grading, it takes a rather steep turn away from the feel of the first two seasons.It's amusing to see the reactions of the audience to the 3rd season of the crown. Settles one of the main debates portrayed in the show about what people expect of the royal family.The first two seasons had an early west wing vibe to them. It was all glorified, feel good nonsense that you just can't stop watching. Season 3 takes a bold step away from this and as any royal adviser would tell you, there's a reason why the monarchy should stick to tradition; such bold actions could indeed prove catastrophic.",7
"Series 4 - terrible","Series 1 - Great
Series 2 - Really good
Series 3 - Alright
Series 4 - Kind of terrible
The problem with series 4 are many, but most of alla it shows how useless the royals have become in society. So it's very hard to keep any interest in them unlike in series 1-3 were they still had some use in cooperation with the government. Now, they are just become expensive and pompous dinosaurs.
Production values are still good and direction also, but it's hard do keep any interest in such people.",1
"BRING ON MORE DIANA!!","I have chosen to write this review because i have extremely passionate feelings about this show... seasons 1-3 were so hard for me to get through quite honestly, maybe im too used to my teen dramas but this was something else. I had finished the show Reign and thought this would be somewhat like that, it is NOT. The royal family are probably some of the worst people on the planet and i couldn't see how i could get through an entire show with JUST THEM as the main cast. It was so boring to me BUT then in season 4, princess diana's time came.The way they told her story was beautiful and i was finally intrigued and invested in the show. Im so happy we finally got to this point and i just hope this continues in future seasons because i reallyyyy need something different from the horridness of the royal family. They're all super great actors though so.",6
"Used to like the crown","If you can't even get the eye colour of the two main royals correct, what else doesn't matter. There are 7 billion people on earth and you can't find two who have blue eyes?!! I'm finished.",4
"Amazing, but 3 season is horrible","Crown is amazing show with interesting plot and good actors. But unfortunately in season 3 everything has changed. I wonder why reviews from famous critics are so positive. Many reviews from real people are absolutely negative in terms of casting of season 3. The actress of new Quinn plays horrible. I have no idea why she is in 39 looks like a woman in 60. And her sister in 35 like in 55. The previous actress was like a real Quinn, but a new one like a old lady in the small village. She has any royal behavior anything. It was the biggest mistake to change the cast. So many people stopped watching the show because of this horrible cast. The actors are good, but for the other roles. In this show they look absolutely inappropriate. Big big mistake, Netflix.",7
"Season 3","I absolutely loved the first 2 seasons and was looking forward to the continued story, however Season 3 is a huge disappointment. This shows the queen as unlikable and unfeeling which I'm sure is not true. Outstanding performances are Princess Anne, the Prime Minister and the Welsh teacher. I'm bored and not sure I can even bother to continue. How could they get the other portrayals of the Royal family so wrong? Damned shame. From brilliant to bring.",5
"The story of a redneck family.","This is a dramatize story of a redneck family in UKi which was the luckiest and dumbest in the world. They won the lottery every day of the week and did everything in their power to make miserable one another. This series focuses on the most important times of their lives which was doing nothing. The actors did their best but the story is getting more boring every season and they change the actors from time to time, to reflect the aging, making it hard sometimes to figure out which is which. If you want to hate the characters then it is a good program, for everyone else, naaa. My thoughts watching this program was why do they keep them?!",6
"Olivia Coleman is lacking.......amongst others","I simply cannot get past Coleman's portrayal of the Queen. Sadly I cannot continue to watch the series. Nothing more to be said....",2
"Interesting But Extremely Slow","I think that in this show everything works (more or less). It's only its slowness that is very... heavy.The acting, the soundtrack and also the cure of this show is well done.
Take in account that I'm reviewing the fourth season, since I watched the others before I subscribed to IMDb.",7
"Do producers comment here?","The series has lowered the audience (rating) , but I see that producers, employees comment here to deceive us",3
"Great but no so great","So the show is great, it captivated my attention quickly. However, it is clear how much the Brits hate the Americans...especially in the President Kennedy episode and The Americans landing on the moon. The show made our astronauts including Armstrong look like total idiots. It's clear they can't get over our triumphs.",6
"S05 only. The rest is great","For season 5 it almost seems like ""The Crown"" told the directors to make Charles not look so bad, Diana seem like a crazy traitor and the Queen as an overall great. Unlike the other seasons the ""fiction"" parts seem so unrealistic and the facts so boring. I was so looking forward to this season because of Diana and everything that she did but they didn't even show some of the iconic things she did and why she was the princess of people's hearts. I hope they redeem themselves with a season 6...if there is one.The rest of the seasons is great! 10/10. It's a pity that for one season I had to change my overall rating.",5
"Skip season 4","The last season was painfully dim. For me it was like reading a few pages of each chapter of a book and fill in the rest. The actor who portrayed Charles was much too handsome and rugged looking. Charles was built like a pencil and homely. I don't know what was missing but something was. Dreary. I still think Diana was murdered. Much was glossed over. Was Cathrines meeting William so contrived? The very end was apt. In life Charles is indecisive not confident as portrayed. Needless to say, I was really disappointed. Almost a study in angst. I know you'll want to watch the last episodes but don't expect too much.",6
"Sad Season 3","Why are Olivia Coleman's costumes so dowdy looking. Claire Foy always looked impeccable. That blue dress Coleman had on Ep 3, looked like a maid's dress they just pulled out of the dryer. Coleman is also lacking facial expressions. She always looks so dismal. I guess because she has those distinct teeth and if she shows them, she'll just look like regular Olivia Coleman.",5
"Excellent, until recasting","Nothing against the new cast of actors per se, but the tone of the show shifted enormously. It felt like The Crown had been cancelled, and a new show had begun under the same name without the viewer being made privy to the decision, storylines being abruptly cut off, discarded for new plot points, and characters being re-written along with the recast.
I stopped watching after the first episode of season 3. It no longer felt like the characters and story I had become invested in.",7
"From period drama to complete fantasy world.","The first series started off being outstanding but with each consequent series it has slowly gone downhill until the most recent and hopefully last series which is just so obviously steeped in fantasy that it is essentially unwatchable.The only good thing about the complete fantasy surrounding the latest series in particular is that hopefully it will make people realise that the series should not be taken as a historical documentary as many people seem to confuse it as.The early series were essentially good period dramas with just enough of a hint of believability and vague memory to suck you in to believing it may actually be a reasonable interpretation of what happened but as we have progressed along the timeline and the events portrayed have become living and recent memory for an increasing number of viewers it becomes increasingly obvious that its grip on reality was at best extremely vague and with the now inclusion of ghosts and the completely fantastical it has dropped any illusion it may have had of being based on any form of reality.As it started good and ended poorly with the tipping point somewhere around the middle i feel that 5/10 seems perfectly fitting.",5
"Quality Varies Wildly Between Seasons","Seasons 1 & 2:
Sceptical at first, believing the series would be ridiculously dramatic and fictional, the production of The Crown is very impressive. Claire Foy fits the description perfectly and matures brilliantly as the story develops. Casting overall is well done, and even Lithgow, an American, gives an impressive portrayal of Churchill.For me, though, the quality of episodes dipped up and down significantly with each arc. Episodes regarding the Great Fog, or the Marberg Files were hugely enticing, and these nuggets of history forgotten by most now are brought to people's attention without straying too far from the facts. They were an interesting, exciting history lesson. However, any story revolving around Princess Margaret I found to be insufferable. Perhaps it's individual taste, and I can't deny that the acting was good, but each time the Princess' love life came up I would find the following hour incredibly dull. Unfortunately these episodes were fairly regular.8/10Season 3:
The tone regarding the Queen shifts quite dramatically with the new cast. Coleman is an excellent representation of a maturing Queen, but is portrayed so that you gradually lose sympathy for her as the episodes progress.Emphasis switches from the Monarch onto Charles especially, with episodes also dedicated to Philip and Margaret. Charles' episodes are particularly emotive and it was also good to see a number of more episodes dedicated to important events within the country's history. The biggest improvement for me was the portrayal of Princess Margaret, played by Bonham Carter. No more insistent 'Woe-Is-Me' plots and a character you could emphasise with was created.9/10Season 4:
Atrocious. Any relatability towards the royals possibly gained over three seasons stripped away as all but Charles become instantly dislikeable, and even then a few episodes further along he's the most dislikeable. Charles' love story is ridiculously fictitious keeping Camilla in the loop for no reason and casting what is really a crap excuse of Diana. You would hope the word 'Mummy' would come up less from adults as well as it makes my skin crawl every time.Worst of all is Thatcher. Not only does she speak like a stroke survivor still smoking 40 a day, but she's presented as some martyr for the British people, trying to shake up a system in order to benefit the everyman. Essentially we fought the Falklands because Thatcher lost her son for a bit, seems reasonable.Admittedly, episode 5 is brilliant. That may be solely down to attention being directly on a victim of Thatcher, rather than the royals or her. The actor playing Fagan is phenomenal, and finally represents what Thatcher caused.Ultimately though, the series has transitioned to fiction loosely based on a historical source. I've given up continuing, a soap opera isn't what this series began as.",6
"Untrue","So many of the stories are untrue that I feel uncomfortable watching the series. The writer has admitted a dislike for the monarchy, and is particularly harsh on Prince Philip. Any ordinary family would sue the program.",3
"Season 3 is weird!","So the end of season 2 happened in 1962 i guess and suddenly season 3 which starts in 1964 (2 or 3 years later) has 10 years or even 20 years older cast !! What a mess!!! The cast choice is completely messed up in season 3!! The director didn't pay attention to the simplest details like that queen Elizabeth's eyes were blue and Olivia Coleman's were brown. The age gap really is huge and unjustified. I can't get used to that huge cast change and how drastically it affected my urge to continue this series.Not sure whether i will continue watching or not.However, season 1 and 2 were so good. The cast was perfectly fitted in.",6
"Hard to like older Royals","I am old enough to remember the Princess Diana period, am same age as Prince Charles. Well acted series but easy to see what a miserable life they all had, privileged or not. I really feel sorry for that poor young girl who got wrapped up in it. I believed then as I do now, Charles was a coward for not standing up to his Mother!",5
"Bitter Writers & Producers Without Crowns","While nothing can exceed Hollywood's loathing of America, their jealous hatred of Britain's royal family is on full display in this series' fourth season. Try to find in it any reference to Britons' reverence for the monarchy or any mention of the many public service events dominating the weekly schedules of the Queen and other royal family members.Then try to imagine Hollywood ever turning such a jaundiced eye on the Obamas, Clintons or Bidens.",6
"As boring as real royal house is","The reason i started watching this was because i hoped for some kind of real life drama, but i guess since I'm not a British man a mannered ""fight"" over what flower to put in the vase is not that exciting.
The royal institution is belong to the past and interests no one but the old queen and some weird old British people. This show is no different.
This show is literally one the most boring and grueling thing i have ever watched.
Its 3 stars and no less only for the authentic acting. Rather than that 1 star show.",3
"Overrated,boring and uninteresting..","Do yourself a favor and stay away from this especially if you have intentions of watching it dubbed in other language then English and you are not interested and passionate about monarchy and this kind of subject because the series tells a verry boring history of the royal family..that is like every other mediocre family out there but here the only special particularly is that characters where born in the royal family and thats it..nothing else formidable about them..i found my self and not only (my wife too) to struggle to watch more than 2 episodes per day and found interesting and good in turn of 3 episode per season ..currently on season 3 and damn its so hard to continue..how the hell did this won so many prizes? Because in my opinion won only for political reasons and because its about the royal family..the acting is good..music and camera work too but..its te history part that is nothing wow..and you cant change that...",6
"Absolutely Ruined A Great Series in the Third Season-","The casting was perfect in Seasons One and Two. For some reason, the producers decided that they had to replace the cast with older versions starting in Season Three. This was a disaster! The new cast had no chemistry nor appreciation of the evolution of their characters. With today's make-up artists there was no reason not to ""age"" the existing staff. The opening episode features a 39 year old Elizabeth. Unfortunately Olivia Colman looked much older and totally out of place. This is too bad as the first two seasons were over the top good and gave you a real sense of the people behind the crown.",2
"The royal family pov doesn't make any sense","From the first season, the series adapted the Royal family pov, or tbh the queen and princess Charles.But when it comes to Princess Diana line, and prince Harry line.It's too much, and it's so obvious that the writer adopted one pov and defending it during the last season.Don't get me wrong the series has everything to succeed but if only the writer tried another narrative or tried to be more clever with his ""hidden"" message about how William is good and how Camilla suffered!! Last thing, Suddenly Margaret became a good sister after making her a horrible character in the beginning of the show, which proves that the writer just follows the queen narrative, only.",6
"Seasons 1&2 Excellent, Diana onwards fictionalized dross","The historical inaccuracies of later seasons that impact the lives of the current Royal family and in particular the King completely turned me off this series despite some very good acting by the cast members. The fictionalization has run amok, it was relatively okay in seasons 1&2 but became idiotic in later seasons. Why on earth would the script writers have Prince Charles asking then Prime Minister John Major to persuade his mother to abdicate when nothing of the sort ever happened. Sensational script to titillate audiences I guess but the irreparable harm is that those who don't know UK history believe this dross to be true.",1
"Last series started badly ...","Terrible Thatcher impersonation - played like she was an imbecile instead magnificent. Diana not well chosen either. What a bad beginning to an otherwise great series.",7
"Infuriating and Gorgeous","Fabulous production. Too bad the writers have lazily fallen back on tired clichés and stereotypes in portraying the main characters. I have read extensively about the monarchy, and if the writers of this series have also done so, it is not evident here.By all accounts, Queen Elizabeth and the Prince Philip are delightful, down-to-earth, good humored people, so completely without affectation that they once spoke of someone they had met as being ""too posh for people like us."" In that regard, the end of ""The Marionettes"" episode was particularly galling. The Queen Mother was not the arch, sour snob she is here. She was a bright and happy woman who understood her calling and gave all 100+ years to serving joyfully. (Serving joyfully is a concept apparently lost on the creators of this dreary exercise.) Instead, the writers are sympathetic to poor lost Margaret and the wretched Duke and Duchess of Windsor, self-absorbed characters who lived empty purposeless lives.",5
"Solid yet somewhat uninspired","The newest Netflix series follows the life of Queen Elizabeth II, starting with the time of her ascension to the thrown after the death of her father George VI. The show focuses on the most common narrative in her biographies: the strive to balance the intricacies of the life of the royal family against her role as an institution in the political and public landscape of the country. Save for a few flashback scenes, the storyline follows the historical line of events, adding little in terms of speculations or contradictions to the common public interpretation.To be honest, having watched recent great Netflix shows as 'House of Cards', 'Narcos' and 'Stranger Things', 'The Crown' felt, while solid, somewhat flat. Out of these four shows it is undoubtedly the most 'mainstream' one. And while that is not a bad thing per se, my main gripe is that the show never leaves the treaded paths of the 'royal' genre. This starts with the way that Elizabeth II is portrayed: an essentially flawless (though at first insecure) queen surrounded by people acting more often than not upon purely personal - and flawed by virtue of simply being human - motives. The resulting 'superhuman' depiction of the Queen to me feels superficial and does not leave much room for character depth. Now it is understandable that retelling the story of someone who has been in the public eye for over 70 years, revered by millions, dictates limits to the narrative - unless you are willing to take risks. Yet I wish that the the show did take at least SOME risks. In the end of the day, 'The Crown', while not as captivating or original as other recent Netflix series, offers an enjoyable and pitoresque depiction of some of Britain's history.",7
"What happened?","Seasons one and two were excellent. In season three I find I am watching a totally different program.....one which is terrible. Changing the entire cast was stupid and more than ill-advised. What were they thinking? Claire Foy was brilliant, sensitive and very likable, very much like Queen Elisabeth II.I am not sure I can endure Seasons Three and Four with the present cast. Maybe the cast for Seasons Five and Six will be better. I do hope the writing improves!!!!!!!!",2
"Boring","I gave it a 7 because the scenery, clothes, casting, and acting were excellent, but what were the Writers thinking? This T.V. Series is so boring. The Monarchy already has a reputation for being boring, but I thought this would be different because it's about a young Prince and Queen. Didn't they ever have any excitement in their lives? I'm stuck on Season 1, Episode 2 and I don't know how much more I can take. If anybody is looking for some good Series, try Poldark (Amazon), Grand Hotel (Hulu) or Velvet (Netflix). So far this is way too boring.",7
"Season 1 and 2 only","The first 2 seasons of this show were incredible. Couldn't have asked for a more well- done and enjoyable show to become engrossed in. I couldn't wait for season 3! I'm doing 2 separate reviews because I cannot believe they changed the main characters over to ""age"" them. Such a disappointment to start Season 3 and see the changes",5
"The frown,why I frown at the lies of- how- why -when -what is real","A must watch series for entertainment, but when the press revealing that they stretched the truth about more than a few fact just to add drama. Today finding out that its pure fiction is a downer, but at least the illusion was fun while it last and with great cast and stories i can't wait to Finnish the last few episodes. The best lie had to be queen kissing Churchill on his death bed maybe he was a force ghost. The lies are so long that there's now a book detailing every lie in every episode. Best episodes Charles at boarding school, Margret in America, Prince Philip's talking to Neil Armstrong. ""Great acting""",7
"BRING CLAIRE FOY BACK","Totally agree. Season 3 is bad. Wake up sheeple critics!",3
"Boring","The acting is good but it covers what has to be one of the most boring monarchs in history.",6
"Find something else to watch this weekend","Skip this series if you have any regard for the truth. Too bad the writer and producer, Peter Morgan, is so very intent on defaming the Royal Family and nearly everyone else involved in British society at the time. Most notably its males. The result is that otherwise stellar qualities of cast and crew are squandered, and Hollywood is yet again made to look like the clumsy propaganda arm of the political left. And paying viewers its long- suffering dupes.A role it has relished since at least the 1960s and shows no signs of disavowing.",2
"Almost.","This was such a great show. Great actors, great script. But then, ""Porn"". I don't get it? Unless you were trying to ruin a great show! It was just not nessasry to the story, or the characters! Am I missing something? Is this what the public wants. I am sure that there are plenty of porn titles out there to choose from, right? Why can't people just watch porn without infecting everything else.",7
"Boring....","I really don't get why many people are in awe of this title. Nothing happens as British roayalty is a boring. Granted, costumes are great, but that is it. No scandals, no plots, no story...Since there is no real interesting story, the actors over-act to make us believe something is happening while there is not.I Had to work myself through the first episode and I do not believe it is a plot spoiler if I say that they get married in the first episode and that is about it. Kept thinking about the red wedding in Game of Thrones and how exciting that wedding was compared to this one. The red wedding took about 2-3 minutes, this one about half an hour and felt like hours. As Netflix does not want to get on the wrong side of British Royalty, I am sure this will stay a very tame and lame series for all the remaining episodes. I am not going to waste my time on this series anymore and will instead be reading a book on the Romanovs (Simon Sebag Montefiori). Now that is interesting Royalty!",1
"interesting story, great work by the creators of the series","When watching the series, I enjoyed a lot (I learned a lot of new things, I refreshed my memory with the details of the last 50 years, which I myself witnessed and remember well). From the very beginning of the first series, there was a little bit of action, events, then, when the great Winston Churchill appears on the screen, everything changes and begins to play with bright colors (as well as the appearance of Mrs. Margaret Thatcher and Princess Diana on the screen).What is missing (in my opinion): I would like to start the story from the time of Queen Mary or Queen Victoria, show more details, details of relationships with public life and British foreign policy, for example, show in detail World War 1, details of management during World War 2, little attention was paid to Churchill's funeral, awarding The Beatles in the Buckingham palace, and some other details.I hope spin-offs will be filmed or details will be in new seasons, like flashbacks.",7
"Boring Dull & Plain Dumb Choices for Replacement Actors","Olivia Coleman looks like a Axe Murderer playing the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Sorry, but the transition from Claire Foy, who was outstanding, to this dull walking crazy looking doormat played by Olivia Coleman...Why did she earn a Oscar? I don't think she is good. I don't understand these critics giving raving reviews to these replacements. Helen Bonham Carter saved the show...the only real talent left.",3
"Prince Charles - surprisingly empathetic character","Third Season:
While it took a while to warm up to the new queen (the earlier Claire Foy was so much more winsome and charming!) once Prince Charles enters the scene (literally), he makes sure we invest in the drama completely! Who would have thought one would empathise with Prince Charles! Josh O Connor as Prince Charles is superb! He is sensitive, acutely self aware, awkward of his legacy and so hungry for maternal love. His hurt is so palpable when he is royally ignored by his mother after his brief but difficult stint at Wales and the inspired, inclusive speech he gives at his investiture ceremony. One wonders why the Queen could not be a more affectionate mother.
My favourite was the last 15 minutes of the Season Finale. It was so good I watched it twice! Beautifully rounds up the Queen as a person and as a monarch.",7
"Sack the writers!","The new actors in Season 10 of the Crown TV series were excellent in their performance and cannot be faulted. However, the story writers of the TV show have no idea how to write a drama and should be sacked! Season 10 of the Crown was boring and extremely depressing - painful to watch from start to finish. The writers obviously took a few British tabloid headlines of the times and did nothing to create an imaginary story line, unlike previous seasons. A definite lack of imagination on their part! If your going to make up fairy tales about princes and princesses at least make it exciting! It is definitely the worst TV drama I have ever watched.",1
"You have to finish it well","Starts really nice ( first few episodes), then season 6 complete desaster.You have to finish it in a good way to have a successful series.Also character change was quite a shock, all in one series.I believe so many details were approved by the crown. But at the end I have learned so much about British royal family, and politics around it.It is definitely high budget series, I'm disappointed how they messed up season 6 with characters speaking to a dead.If you have time to spend, then I recommend to watch only to learn some stuff that crow was comfortable with.Thank you for reading my review. All the best.",6
"Slander for Profit","Extremely well crafted character assassinations. Numerous fabricated defamitory conversations between the queen, her husband and children portray them as callous, vain monsters. Queen Elizabeth II is painted as an uneducated, unfeeling automaton with no notion of motherhood while her son Charles is portrayed as a damaged, clueless weakling, a grave disappointment to his austere unloving parents. Other family members fare poorly. Only Princess Diana fares well as the sweet, innocent victim of the Windsor's indifference. Labor Prime Ministers fare well while their opposition are seen as cold, unsympathetic elites. Netflix has bet heavily on Meghan and Harry so this whole series biased undermining of the royal family comes as no suprise.",1
"Basically a tale of how stuck up the Qween is","Never understood the relevance of the Royal Family in modern times. Now after watching the first 10 episodes, I understand it's just not relevant",6
"LETS HAVE CONTINUITY","I've just started watching The Crown and I'm a little disappointed that the producers can't get it right at least when it comes to the Queen. Let's have some form of continuity when changing the actors as the years/series progress. In the 21st century with colored contact lenses available, why can we not at least get the Queen's eye color correct. In series 3 the Queen appears to have brown eyes.",1
"Sentimental nonsense","Needs many other pints of view and secondary characters- royal family are boring and ridiculous and disgusting- why would you watch such silly outdated decadence and greed.",6
"Garbage","Watched the first episode. 40 mins into the show, realized how BS the show was. So slow and boring. GARBAGE. Cannot get myself to watch the rest of the season.",1
"Camilla","So I see there is going to be a 6th season which I look forward to. It is a great series. One of my issues is Camilla Parker-Bowls.....in real life she is very ugly, I mean really ugly and I don't understand why the woman playing her is quite good looking. They've done a great job with Diana, but not with Camilla. I just don't understand.....are they going to age her to look as awful as she really does??? What do other people think of the good looking women that have played her so far??? I'm just curious if I'm the only one that thinks they need to portray Camilla as ugly as she is??? I guess we will find out when season 6 is released. And as a final thought, how could the now King of England fall in love with an incredibly ugly woman when he had a gorgeous Diana. I haven't paid any attention to the Royal Family since the passing of Diana. She was the light, the caring and compassionate woman that was tortured by a family that had no light, no caring and totally uncompassionate, so incredibly sad 😞",7
"Inaccurate","And her voice is horrible in series 3.
An overrated actress.",1
"A royal snoozefest","I tuned in to Netflix's ""The Crown"" hoping to like it as much as the rest of the world seemingly does. Yet, while the rave reviews pour in for this beloved series, I find myself in a peculiar spot as one of the few who can't seem to stay awake while watching it. I don't discount the allure of historical drama or the British monarchy's grandeur, but for me, ""The Crown"" makes for a phenomenal sleep aid rather than riveting entertainment.I can understand why show enthusiasts watch ""The Crown"" for its lush production quality, convincing acting, and dedication to historically accuracy. I, on the other hand, watch this show as a cure for insomnia. I'm not sure if that's due to the dry characters or slow pacing; I can never stay awake long enough to tell. But for me, this series just feels like a lullaby, gently guiding me into a royal slumber. Good night, Elizabeth. Good night, Philip. Good night, Charles. Good night.",6
"Synopsis of Tabloid Headlines","I've watched this series since the beginning, always hoping it will get better. It never does. It's really insipid and has very little, ""well, that was interesting"" content. I just finished season/series 5 and will watch season/series 6 because I want to see how they handle Diana's death. I bet, though, it will show the crash, go to Diana laying in the car saying, ""my god, what happened?"" (because I think that's what she said as she was dying) and then they'll move to some other BS. Seriously, if you've seen the headlines from the news or tabloids, there's nothing really to see in this series.",2
"Season 1 & 2 were great, then....","In season 3 they replaced all the actors with actors who appear to be 15 to 20 years older than the person they are playing. Suddenly Princess Margaret is a 53 YO sot, instead of a young, vibrant, slightly offbeat royal. Queen Elizabeth is suddenly being played by someone who looks about as undignified as a person can be. The original actress was so good - it's disappointing. Season 1 and 2, I would give at least 9 stars and season 3 pulled the score way down. I understand that Season 4 is great and that helps me get through Season 3. I think they would o better using makeup to age the actors than confusing the audience in having to figure out who is who - episode 3 and I still didn't know who the Queen Mother was! I thought that woman was a distant poor relation.",7
"Is it fiction or fact ?","Needs to decide what it is. Fiction about real people seems to be slanderous to me, although the Royal Family would not go through the unedifying ordeal of litigation would they ? So easy targets. Shameful.",1
"Drama - Yes. But factual - Highly questionable.","This is without doubt a well acted quality drama piece. However, whether or not much of it is fact is highly questionable. There are many scenes which take places between the characters, that unless witnessed are really just pure supposition. The presentation of it, intermingled with factual pieces, give it the outward misleading appearance of being truth. Unfortunately it seems many people are being mislead into believing this. As a piece of drama it is excellent and well worth watching. However, to me, it loses points for misleading people into believing it's fact.",6
"Terrible","I tried to make it through the first episode but this was terrible. Next time I have trouble sleeping I'll put this on because it is boring on a whole new level. I'm truly amazed that people rated this highly. There really isn't much more to say. It's bad, really bad, and it didn't hold my interest in the slightest. The characters were boring, the dialogue was boring and I couldn't watch another minute of this. So now I'm just writing filler. BUT Peaky Blinders is a GREAT Netflix show and I highly recommend that. The Crown sucks but Peaky Blinders was a ton of fun and I can't wait for the next season. I guess I still have to write stuff blah blah this is a stupid requirement for leaving a review when one or two sentences will totally suffice.....",1
"Not as gripping as first two seasons","It was ok.Initially didn't like Olivia Colman's Queen but then tuned into that period of Elizabeth's life and enjoyed her. Tobias Menzies' Prince Philip was quite dull though.Hopefully things will get a bit more interesting with Season 4.",7
"Bof","I liked the first seasons above all, even if the changes in actors disturbed me a little. We are coming to the final episodes of this saga and I must say that I am appalled by the casting. Already I was absolutely not convinced by Charles and Diana, that's nonsense. It seems like they were looking for any redhead to play Harry, it doesn't matter, as long as he's a redhead. William is hardly better represented. I don't understand why such actors were recruited. It makes it look sloppy. I will have very mixed memories of this series. Let this series be a work of fiction based on real characters, why not? But as long as we respect a minimum of resemblance between the characters and the actors.",4
"THE CROWN - SEASON 3","The Crown Season 1 & 2 was so beautifully written, stylised and acted that we all fell in love with the actors and the overall production that it soon became everyone's favourite series.We were taken into a world behind the pomp and ceremony and finally understood the people behind the power and majesty of the Monarchy as well as the personal struggles of the Queen and her family.Both brilliant in concept and film production it effortlessly allowed the audience become deeply attached to their favourite characters triumphs as well as their failures. This deep connection with the audience was what made it such a successful in Season 1 & 2.And with great expectation Season 3 arrived and within minutes lost this connection and betrayed the trust built up so arduously over the previous 2 seasons. The magic was broken! Not because to the story stopped or had nothing to say but because suddenly the actors we knew and loved were not recognisable.Apart from their change of appearance, their inner reactions and thoughts were alien to us and they didn't react, walk or talk the same. It became a different program that had distanced itself and was never coming back!As the beloved audience our bond with our previously loved characters suddenly disappeared within the first few minutes. We were left sad, dazed and confused made worse by the fact that it was still such a highly polished production.From an overall production point of view, the argument that you had to change the actors for older looking ones is definitely not valid these days with all the options of film mastery, makeup and video 'ageing' technology used everyday by Hollywood.Even if we had kept our original actors from Season 1 & 2 and seen a slow minimal effect of ageing we would still have had our beloved characters.Season 3 - such a sad disappointment that could have been easily rectified with a better understanding of how you are playing to your audience and asking them love your characters and your story.",7
"Don't bother if you hate lies.","Thought the show was brilliant until this most recent series. (5) Yes I know it's not based on facts but this new series's has been absolutely disgusting and un called for nasty. I watched 5 episodes. A whole episode on the Al-Fayeds, why? And don't get me started on the Diana actress, very good accent but the looking at the floor?? I'm surprised she wasn't forever walking into things. This show has done nothing but portray Charles and the bad guy in the marriage and Diana the hard done by one, when we all know that's not entirely true, and making Diana a sad pathetic woman with no kind of back bone, and we know that wasn't true either. I hope the next series really is the last of all they are going to do is portray lies and malice, and I wonder when the creator is going to give back he's honour ??",3
"Casting is just fantastic.","Fell in love with this series. The costume, locations and casting is just fantastic and I felt as though the stories were very well portrayed. There wasn't one character in there that I didn't think was cast perfectly. Such a shame that the story line couldn't last much longer! Here's to hoping there's a series 2 in the pipeline.",7

"Lost me at 3","I struggled to watch Season 4. I find it boring and difficult to watch with any sort of attention. I have been trying to discover how this show continues to win awards. The acting is sufficient only. Probably because the story is a recount and re-manufacture of reality and most of us lived through the first time. Might be why I managed 1, 2 and parts of 3 since they were before my time or my complete notice. I will not even give 5 a shot.",2
"Camilla","So after watching all this doesn't think that Diana was murdered just so Charles and Camilla can be together because remember he can't remarry unless his wife is dead obviously Diana was the princess of all times Camila I think you're disgusting and despicable woman and you don't deserve anything your have just my opinion. He's a cheater she's a cheater and they killed Princess Diana her poor children have to watch this and see the truth about what their father and stepmother are really about. As far as I'm concerned they should both be prosecuted we all know it's the truth what a disgrace. This page makes you go on and on and on but I think you get my point the monarchy is a disgrace if this is how they treat one of their own just to let a cheater and his girlfriend live in life while the babies mom dies.",6
"First season","Loved the first season. Great actors. However we have stopped watching as the new actors simply don't grab your attention nor portray them as well. The aging from 1964 to 65 is too great. They eye color of the Queen and her disposition has changed too much. Not genuine anymore done with it.",4
"Royal History Brought to Life","This series is very character driven and the story is linked to the history of Britain from the mid-20th century to the present. Elizabeth II, the British monarch since 1952, belongs to both centuries. Many of us want to learn about the young woman who became Queen and how she fared in those early years of her reign in the 1950's, coping with personal conflicts, and learning the job that she inherited on the death of her 56 year old father. This first season did not disappoint me. The pace was slow at first but I was soon drawn into the events of the period. Claire Foy captures the beauty and charm of the young Queen. On a visit to Africa with her husband, she finds out that her father has died and she is immediately proclaimed Queen. The turn of events is very starkly projected onto our television screen. The king's funeral follows. Thrust upon the world stage, with advisors and Palace staff, we follow her through her Coronation and then a constitutional crisis involving Princess Margaret, her younger sister. We see the Queen Mother coping with grief from the death of her husband, the loss of her home and title. The Queen's husband, Phillip, an ambitious young man, sets aside his naval career and plays the supporting role to his wife. Elizabeth tries to treat him as an equal but it seems there is no way as the Prince Consort, to take up a career. Then, there was the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, who shows up seeking more money to finance his lavish lifestyle and that of his wife. Matt Smith performed the energetic and athletic Prince Phillip, who became disillusioned with his limited role; Dame Eileen Atkins, as the grandmother, Queen Mary, is outstanding; Victoria Hamilton as the Queen Mother seems very distant, and not in keeping with the gracious Queen Mother who was so active in her public role; the role of the Duke of Windsor was magnificently performed by Alex Jennings; John Lithgow, in the role of Winston Churchill, seemed out of his comfort zone (Timothy West...maybe too old now, would have been a better choice); Jeremy Northam was very suited to Anthony Eden, the former Foreign Minister, who was ailing but tried to work with the Queen over the Princess Margaret affair and then tried unsuccessfully to deal with Egyptian President Nasser; Jared Harris didn't look at all like King George VI but he was very convincing in the role of the ill-fated king who took over from his brother, presided over victory in World War II and died at age 56. All in all, it is great television viewing for those with an interest in the evolution of the Monarchy and the British Royal Family under Elizabeth II.",7
"Second Season Deeply Disappointing","Well-produced historical drama devolves into graphic, gratuitous pornography in show #7 of Season 2. Why do the movie-land snowflakes have to ruin everything with their licentious worldview?",1
"Bold and truthful","The Crown is a Netflix series based on the British family and their drama. The storyline surrounds the rise of Queen Elizabeth II and her reign as the longest standing ruler of the British monarchy. Peter Morgan's mastery of the Queen's private life is brought to the small screen. The series showed that the queen had no power and she was useless especially with her own people. I could not stand your nonsense and that her reign never took sides and never showed emotion till the very end. In seven decades on the throne, Queen Elizabeth II saw 15 prime ministers from Winston Churchill who was played by John Lithgow to Margaret Thatcher, she was played by the brilliant Gillian Anderson to Tony Blair. This show has won 21 Emmy's so far and I could definitely see plenty more due to the great cast. Over the course of the series Claire Foy, Olivia Coleman, Imelda Staunton, Marion Bailey and Victoria Hamilton played Elizabeth while Matt Smith, Tobias Menzies, and Jonathan Pryce played Prince Phillip. Prince Charles was primarily played by Dominic West and Josh O'Connor. Princess Diana was cleverly played by Emma Corrin and Elizabeth Debicki. The queen's sister Princess Margaret was portrayed by Helena Bonham-Carter and Lesley Manville. Jared Harris acted as King George VI during the first few seasons. The second to the last season the story surrounds Charles and Diane's turmoil relationship which lead to their divorce. The final season concentrated on Diane's private till her death and Charles's remarriage. We see the boys grow up and you will also notice the power of the monarchy diminish. Overall it was a good series but the queen just pissed me off, she was selfish and unworthy. If you are like me and like historical pieces, then check it out.",7
"For your kind information, India has never been a private property of the Royals!","With a little fact and big fantasy, it is rather a big fat tele soap to me. Season 1, ep: 5, the epic conversation during coronation of queen : Lord Mountbatten gave India and his wife to Mr. Nehru. Really? Since when India has been considered as private property of British Royals that they thought about giving our country to someone as a gift? No one needs to watch the full series to satisfy their curiosity behind mysterious death of their beloved princess Diana. This conversation itself which reflects the attitude of the so called Royal family, is enough to realise the tragedy and therefore hinders me from watching rest of the episodes. This movie is of high rating surely for those people who love to live in the heaven made of fools. You guys truly deserve the sympathy from almighty! Amen !!!",1
"Season 1 best, final seasons got worse","The Crown early seasons were my favorite seasons. Season 1 in particular was spectacular as it followed a young Princess Elizabeth who later becomes Queen due to extraordinary circumstances. She didn't expect it at the young age of 25. She never has a normal life afterwards and has to learn confidence. In season 2, we see how it affects the family, particularly Princess Margaret.Seasons 3-4 had some of my favorite casts. Olivia Coleman did a magnificent job portraying The Queen as strong. This is the peak of the writing for The Crown.In later seasons, we see Princess Diana getting the spotlight. There were some strange cast choices, such as Prince Harry.Overall, it's an entertaining show inspired by true events, although the dialogue is not really historically accurate.",7
"Thin gruel","Excellent argument for getting rid of the monarchy and all its little monarchists, camp followers, enablers and other assorted parasites. Nice MG though.",2
"Harrods van for the majority of us","I spent more than 50 hours watching this series which is more than a week of work, over 4 months and it was worth it. The arithmetic in the number of episodes is curious. One decade per season. 6 seasons for 7 decades of reign.Furthermore, the similarity of the series with the documentary reported in the Bubbikins episode is paradoxical.There is a big cast change in seasons 3 and 5. The Queen appears increasingly cold and distant from reality.Churchill obviously the most emblematic PM. In second place: Thatcher.I liked Margaret (especially Helena Bonham Carter), in the role of Elizabeth I highlight Olivia Colman and Emma Corrin in the role of Diana. The tradition of horses is captivating. Season 3 the best season.Favorite episodes: S02E04 - Beryl, S0302 - Margaretology, S03E04 - Bubbikins about Philip's mother, S05E03 - Mou Mou, S05E06 - Ipatiev House and S06E09 - Hope House.On the negative side, the decline of values, superfluous subjects that are too extensive and debated such as titles, palaces, yachts and carriages. Appearance is everything.Alan Lascelles unbearable. Edward VIII self-interested. Suez Crisis and Cold War with little development. In season 1 I did not highlight any episode. S03E03 - Aberfan the worst episode. S05E04 - Annus Horribilis with endings that are equally difficult to watch until the end and S05E07 - Woman's Land due to lies and intrigue are the low points of this series.Season 4 the worst. From IRA, to Charles and Diana's relationship. Family members reported as deceased. As Diana's death only happens in the episode: S06E03, it becomes difficult to follow the troubled relationship with Charles, especially the end of season 5 and the beginning of season 6, despite there being occasional monuments of joy and affection.Good references to British and American history like Bagehot; Malcolm Muggeridge; Saul Below; Rudyard Kipling; P. G. Wodehouse; Shooting Diaries by Colonel Peter Hawker; John Keats and PB Shelley. The theater play: A Midsummer Night's Dream is also remembered.",6
"It became about dodi as a Charles substitute","This great series got lost in season 5. It left history in the dust the beauty of its intimate study, was sacrificed to a weird angle on dodi and his father as royal wanabees. Presumably, this was done in preparation for a Diana's turn towards dodi and their eventual deaths. Unfortunately this happens a lot with Netflix and they have amazing seasons and the seasons following them get sacrificed to something other than the organic story. It's such a shame when this happens I can't help but think that the Director somehow got over written playing something outside his own organic storytelling, and since the storytelling was so magnificent, the loss. Seems quite grievous.",5
"Foy and Colman disappoinments","Neither Foy nor Colman was a good choice to play the queen, and that for a simple reason: neither woman is as beautiful as the real Queen Elizabeth, and while Foy was homely, Colman is unlovely-she looks like a fallen cake.I don't know how the real Queen comported herself in private, but Helen Mirren's Queen was always relaxed and natural, whereas Colman's Queen is always stiff, always talks in a clipped fashion, and always looks as if she had stage fright.Colman's Queen looked and sounded human only in ""Favourites"" when she lunched with Prince Andrew. Otherwise she's the Drinker's plank of wood.As for chemistry between QE and PP, the first two seasons were unrelenting in showing the DoE to be a carping, peevish, mean, self-absorbed, and doltish ass. Not for one moment did he do or say anything that made it clear why Elizabeth loved him. I hated him from first to last.But in seasons three and four PP is an entirely different man-thoughtful, sarcastic, teasing. Still nothing between him and the Queen, but at least he doesn't inspire rage each time he speaks.I fear that the actress chosen to play the Queen in the last two seasons will be worse still.",6
"Season 6 has jumped the shark,","Totally inaccurate picture of Diana, Seriously. This woman craved the press, flirted with the paparazzi and squeezed in her children when she wasn't busy courting the limelight and looking for her own Onassis to maintain her lifestyle.She might have found him in Dodi who is portrayed abysmally here. Close to racism. Particularly after her death. Where the blame shines on his family and never on the total lack of security provided to her by the RF.But the very worst of this whole half a series is Diana as a saintly ghost counselling Charlie AND the queen.Charlie bawling his eyes out is another figment of someone's imagination. Thin plot stretching at its finest.Speaking of plot, it appears some pressure was put on the writers to show the RF in a more favorable light. Witness Charlie and Cam dancing the night away while he recites Jane Austen. Nope.They trashed a reasonably good series. It's laughable.If I have the energy rather than the ennui I will watch the December finale.2/10 for the moors and Balmoral and Imelda Staunton.",2
"Not for Everyone","Acting is amazing. Sets and production are top notch. But holy hell is this show boring! I watched the first 2 episodes of season 1 a couple years ago and decided it wasn't for me. After hearing multiple people rave about it since I decided to give it another go. I made it 7.5 episodes this time. But I'm throwing in the towel. I just can't stay interested or engaged in what's happening.Victoria is way better.",6
"SEASON 5 HAS RUINED SHOW","While in part based in fact, the fifth season has ruined this semi-biographical series. The casting is better than in seasons 3 and 4, it appears that this season was intended to make all members of the British Royal family look horrible. Not one character is 'off-limits'. Disgusting! Seems as if the rumors that Prince Henry (Harry) was a consultant to the show may be true as his Duchess appears to have stolen lines directly from Diana. An abomination! Dominic West is as handsome as ever, Debecki does well as Diana and Imelda Staunton is far more credible than Olivia Coleman, but that's about all I can say for this season.",3
"Why bother?","Other than watching a bunch of wonderful actors there is little reason to watch this series since there is most likely very little truth in the history. We have learned in the psst few years that much of what goes on behind the royal doors is often distorted for the benefit of the loving public. Still, if TV was real then it would probably be called something else! :-) And again, watching it for the wonderful acting is good enough for non-royalists, so enjoy.",7
"Brilliant from Season 1-4, tanks spectacularly in Season 5","Season 1 to 4 of the Crown were a brilliant work of art, the stories were interesting and even though the dialogues are fiction, the writers seemed to have done alot of fact checking and kept close to actually historical events. The cinematography is great on the series. Beautifully shot scenes. Then you get to Season 5...so disappointing...I fell asleep twice watching it. It feels like a PR job for King Charles and the monarchy. Long boring monologues that put you to sleep and out of place proclamations as if the series is an ad for British superiority. Its a bit ridiculous. Also Camilla is just there, hardly any dialogue, a departure from previous seasons, she didn't have to be the villain but she's just docile here...Which is false because facts is she played a big role in the character assassination of Princess Diana with her media friends and threw Dianas children under the bus by leaking false storues to elevate her image. This was covered in several documentaries like the Princes and the Press before Spare came out. She is pure evil and the Crown are cowards. I expected the story to revolve around Diana who is one of the most prolific women of her time but we hardly see her, as if all she did was sit in the house when we know she did so much.... She's portrayed as unstable and paranoid, apart from her kindness, we see no layers to her character, we don't really see the world through her eyes, for a woman who was tabloid fodder for so long and has had books written about her, it was a let down. Unbelievable gaslighting for a story so well known to make her seem like a traitor for telling her side of the story and painting the real villains, ie. The firm, Charles and Camilla in a sympathetic light...Not mention of the fact Charles gave an interview first and we dont even get an indepth reaction of Camillagate...That speech by Ann to pacify Charles calling them teenagers in love etc was laughable esp since Charles had other mistresses like Lady Kanga who also died in 1997.... It feels like the stories of the different characters were shot by different people and stitched together. Were the creators of the show censored because of the protests from UK right wing tabloids? Such a shame to have compromised such a brilliant show. I think they should wrap up the show, just cancel it, which is what the Royal Family wanted anyway. I don't trust them with this story anymore, especially don't trust them to tell the story of Diana's death or of Harry and Meghan if the creators are so pro-establishment.Edit: So glad Spare came out, curious to see how courageous the Crown writers are. But I expect them to give us another false love story of William and Kate when Kate waited around for 10 years, chnaged schools and chased William around...while aristocratic women and an American heiress turned down William before he settled for Kate.",4
"Let us bear in mind Docudrama is just fanfiction of the news","Peter Morgan commands respect, awe, even something like fear in the world of film and television. And perhaps such esteem is warranted. I have not seen any of his fictional screenplays or teleplays and so cannot comment on their merits. I can, however, say that docudramas such as 'The Queen', 'The Crown', 'Bohemian Rhapsody', etc., while perhaps clever, well-executed and even highly entertaining, are never indicative of actual brilliance on the part of anyone involved at any step in the production.Docudramas are not history lessons, but they also do not qualify as ""historical fiction."" No matter how good they may be as entertainment, they are at best heavily derivative and often rather dishonest about their subject matter. That dishonesty can be as benign as tweaking continuity to craft a more saleable story structure than what real life would offer, but often it pushes the envelope into mockery and even calumny in order to say what the writer feels entitled to say.There's no question but that 'The Crown' is superbly acted and filmed. And the large majority of episodes - at least prior to Season Five - are quite well-conceived scenario-wise, on their own terms. However, what Peter Morgan chooses to say with them suggests a man who is little more than an unimaginative cog in the machine of the Current Year's cultural establishment. Morgan's Queen Elizabeth II is accordingly sympathetic but not especially useful and - despite her sincerest efforts - dreadfully out-of-step with the times. Not, of course, so much as the rest of her family, but if her interactions with her mother, her sister and her children had been reduced in this tale to the strict minimum, she would have been more difficult to sympathize with, because in a number of episodes she looks good only by comparison.More than once, Morgan's worldview makes for some amusing - and ironic - foils. Few viewers will be surprised (especially after 'The Queen') that Princess Diana evolves into an arch-rival to Her Majesty for the hearts of the people and the incarnation of what it means to be British, but the series actually states this explicitly at one point. There are a number of such moments throughout the series when Morgan's thin imagination shines through and he just goes ahead and makes his point with a sledgehammer. And he didn't even need to. While his portrayal of Diana's psychological condition (as largely stable and mature) in her last years is ludicrous, the ""dual"" line made enough real-life AND literary sense on its own without being spelled out (and in the most outrageously cheesy and deservedly criticized way possible).And prior to the depiction of this ""War of the Waleses,"" Morgan's need for a personal conflict of the 1980s has him pit the Queen against Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by greatly exaggerating their differences and cooling, even frosting, the true nature of their relationship. Here, Morgan freezes a bit himself. Most laymen might intuit that as a former softcore republican (and only tepid monarchist convert), Morgan not only is a bit lukewarm on Her late Majesty but also probably doesn't care much for Lady Thatcher, a suspicion seemingly confirmed by his decision not only to cast his then-flame Gillian Anderson (whose activism does suggest a more avant-gardist brand of political views) in that role but also to instruct her to play Thatcher's movements and tone about ten to fifteen years older than they actually did in her time as Prime Minister. At the same time, determined to accentuate the lead-up to the Queen's ""annus horribilus"" (1992 is portrayed as the culmination of a disastrous preceding decade), he makes sure Thatcher comes across as the sympathetic one in the ""cold feud"" he portrays between them.On the whole, 'The Crown' is (save much of season five and some of season six) very good television in terms of entertainment value and conduciveness to suspension of disbelief. The production and verisimilitude are commendable in the utmost. But Morgan's story is, as narratives go, a cop-out, and viewers should approach it with the same instinctive mistrust with which they ought to approach any docudrama, possibly more, for the reasons I have explained here. Sadly, I think far too many sheeple will come away deceived, as usually happens with this genre.",7
"Relevant for English patriots","A previous reviewer asked why would any sane British person watch this.I would go a little bit further and ask why would any sane Scottish, Irish or Welsh person watch this.I left with the impression that England is the only nation that really matters or is relevant.Do the producers actually know that the Queen of England isnt a proper or official title as England hasnt been a sovereign nation since1707 and that the union of the crowns was 1603 when the official title should be King/Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and later United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Is it ignorance or arrogance?Im afraid Im one of those rare colonials from across the pond that seem to know the difference and that is no thanks to UK television.",1
"Lithgow rules","It took me a minute to get hooked on this series. But the Queen and Churchhill makes it go. Glad they didn't turn season 1 into a war movie!",7
"The most boring show I've ever seen","I was looking forward to watch this show but it's so slow and boring, I don't understand a concept where you talk about the mist for the 60 minutes! First 2 seasons could be just an 90 minute movie and it would have been perfect, there's no need to show us many unnecessary details that slow down the show. So far I managed it to the third season but the change of the actors representing queen and her husband was so unhappy that I'll probably stop watching it.",3
"The Crown A well crafted Masterpiece if you can be bothered to watch","The Crown is a fantastically well made period Drama Everything is spot on a piece of history full of scandal ,politics & conspiracyyou learn so much while watching everything is so well executed every episode is it's own movie it's a series that demands your full attentionit is a slow build but once you commit to it it starts giving back .not a show to binge though one episode feels like enough it's a great watch but not always an easy watch a really phenomenal show thoughif you like period dramas I think this is the one to watch",7
"Just dissappointed on the Season 3 some role casting.","They are great actors, indeed! I dont think so Olivia is good for the role. Its understandable that it has to change for they aged but the change was like its no longer the Queen figure its something different. Foy is like she was born to portrait it, I can feel her acting. But for Olivia sorry her accent is not so british like the queen and her face always frown, Queen Elizabeth had blue eyes. The old version of Queen Margaret is so different as well, dissapointing! Season 1 & 2 got me so hype to watch it, cant think of the next episode but I tried watching Season 3 and I just stopped 😔 Anyhow, I love how the Queen is so brave.",5
"Prince Charles?","Does Prince Charles exist in this cinematic universe? I can't quite seem to find the character in Season 3. Mind you, I haven't watched the entire season, so No Spoilers!",7
"A good watch overall","Very much enjoyed season 1, lots of interactions between all the players in the family and government. Season 2 become more of a study in ego, attitudes and scandals. More of a soap opera style, be that what what it is. Claire was asked to look stunned, surprised, concerned and worried, a lot. I was quite surprised there was not even a single line of dialogue dedicated to the architect of peace in the Suez, Lester Pearson, who even won a Nobel peace prize for it for heavens sake!",7
"Uh oh! Things Were Going Swimmingly Until...","Until season 4 episode 5, where the unemployed Mr Fanan asked a member of parliament ""why is her picture here, it is like being Turkey or Iraq"". Well that is enough to anger any Turk, such as myself. Firstly, a poor historical knowledge to the authors, putting two countries such as Iraq and Turkey in the same category. Secondly, countries such as the United States, also put the pictures of their founders or current presidents on the public offices. So it was all going well until this little incident. No need to attack other countries out of nowhere.",1
"History is beautiful!!!","Best is actress Dina princess of Wales. The Crown is a historical series about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II is I'm so happy to get to watch it on Netflix now great. It is riveting, beautiful, and moving, and I'm so looking forward to watching the rest. It was moving, watching the king die on the show and seeing young Queen Elizabeth first starting out, when now in real life she has passed and her son Charles is now King and taking over. Gives a real sense of time moving on and stopping for no one.Netflix eventually added a disclaimer to the show's title synopsis page on its website, and to the YouTube description of the trailer for season five, that described the series as a ""fictional dramatization"" that was ""inspired by real events...RIP DINA.",7
"The WHOLE Crown!","Seasons 1 & 2 of the Crown was absolutely wonderful! Claire Foy was just brilliant as the young queen & this was backed by a superb support cast. The writing was mostly excellent as was the direction & cinematography, which made for a totally fun & engaging audience experience...THEN..What the heck happened after season 3? Worse still season 5 was a slow dragging, snorefest which made watching paint dry look interesting! I will admit I have not looked into the writers of the later seasons, but even the acting was bad dispite some top actors being among the cast. HBC was about the best as Princess Margaret, but then again I have always enjoyed her work. Next (in the later seasons) came the political angle. When I watch drama like this I wish to be engaged & entertained. What I don't want (& I suspect I am not alone) is a heavy dose of socialism in said drama. Especially when said drama is about the British Royal Family, which is, when all said & done a conservative institution. Why on earth put the political opinions of the creators, writers & director into the Crown? I am simply not interested in their politics. After the politics of later seasons we also have to put up with an anti-British, anti monarchist leaning. Again I must ask ""why""? If you are going to make a watchable, believable drama about the British royal family surely you would not want to include, what I can only term as leftest propaganda. All this is really quite sad as the Crown had an absolutely brilliant start, but as the seasons have gone on the points I have mentioned above, just get worse & worse, which in the end makes this practically unwatchable. Sorry.My 4 starts are strictly for seasons 1 & 2 & I would like to give 10 stars for Clair Foy's excellent portrayal of the young Queen Elizabeth II which was so thrilling to watch. But after season 3 the Crown goes really down hill, sadly. Lastly a note to the writers: Please leave politics out of drama as it spoils it & apolitical people like me (I am neither right or left) find it distracting at best & very boring. Please don't spoil good drama!",4
"Very Moving and Powerful, Despite a Slow Motion","Season 1: With more seasons clearly on their way, the first season of The Crown excellently demonstrates an early section of Queen Elizabeth II's life, with fascinating portrayals of history and exquisite performances. The series is very impressive, powerful and moving, or more like slow-moving. The story can occasionally seem quite difficult to keep up with, but overall, it's very well-constructed and the unforgettable Claire Foy is absolutely magnificent.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",7
"What happened?","Fist two series were great but the third has spoiled it!",5
"Will make you travel","Magic. It moves you to live this story in first person. Everything has been worked very good and is translated in pleasure for the viewer.",7
"The ""Eyes"" Don't Have It","Seasons 1 & 2 were superb and the cast was amazing. They looked the part and the acting and accents were exceptional. I still have no idea why age progression makeup wasn't used. It has been used successfully on, This is Us, and it's 2020 and makeup has come a long way. There is no consistency and each subsequent season seems like a new show with play acting in pretty costumes. The FACT I can't get past is that the vast majority of the Royal Family have BLUE EYES! In the last seasons they have FAILED to cast people with BLUE EYES for (1) The Queen Mother (2) The Queen (3) Princess Margaret (4) Prince Phillip and (5) Prince Charles. This list is not exhaustive, but those are the most noticeable actors. This oversight makes the show so irritating, and the lack of attention to this HUGE DETAIL, makes the show a joke. Get some coloured contacts as it seems there are no actors, in the entire world, with blue eyes. Get it together people.",4
"A great british watch","Having watched the series in it's entirety... so far. I found it to be fantastically produced and acted. Matt Smith's performance is ranged and stand out. The sets and costume have literally no expense spared. The story itself is subtle and respectful of key points in modern british history highlighting many instances i was not aware of. However, there are holes in the writing that hinder the story flow. There are several episodes beginning with cut scenes followed by 6 months earlier which becomes tiresome quickly. There are also poignant and dramatic climaxes that are then never referred to again. Overall a great show but not suitable for casual viewing.",7
"Marxist Drivel but great cinematography","Political indoctrination althouh well shot.
The camera work is superb and the lighting is very good. I would say that the audio leaves a bit to be desired.
It is clearly pushing an agenda yet if one get's past that there is some Sorkinesque dialog.
If you're a former member of the guards you may break your telle.
Rule Britania and God Save the Queen!",2
"A giant!","In the series, you quickly notice how large sums of money have been spent on it. I read somewhere that one episode of one season cost more than the normal cost of the whole season.As has been said here and everywhere, it's really annoying when you don't know what's true and what's a lie.The series was just the right length. In any case, I wouldn't have been able to watch even the first episode of fancy speech and literary language. If the series is true, then I am in the fortunate position that I myself was not born royal. Such a boring and lonely life.I've never commented on anything about music before, but now I have to say that the theme music of this series was extremely boring.A good series and worth watching just because of what can actually be done in TV production when there is money.",6
"Crown of Crowns","The Crown of Crowns The opening credits will remind you of Game of Thrones - music with a heavy base line and galloping tempo and the animated metamorphoses of something metallic, this time not the cogs of an imagined castle, but a crown. All this for a story about a strident but soft- spoken young princess about to be queen. Instead of the blood and gore of GOT there is the constant roiling bronchial cough of King George that is only interrupted by heavy drags on his cigarettes. This cacophonous heavily smoke-fogged scene is repeated a half-dozen times in the first episode to be certain we don't miss the point: the king and all of his doctors see no connection of his smoking to the onset of lung cancer. It's as unsettling as any battle scene in GOT. Throughout the series the throbbing music score which portends enemy sieges in GOT here is used to accompany Elizabeth as she walks up stairs or enters a palace or rides in an automobile. This show is for you if you dislike subtlety. Every important plot point is foreshadowed by courtly sorts or cabinet members discussing the seriousness of what's about to happen, then it happens with lots of musical queues to tell you how to feel when it happens. Since there is no mystery about Elizabeth's future or past, it's all for nothing. Her inner life, psychological struggles, secret loves or hates are never explored. This is a Life Magazine version of young Elizabeth. John Lithgoe does a caricature of Winston Churchill he probably wants to disown. The only reason to watch this heavy-handed trivial story is Eileen Atkins who plays Elizabeth's grandmother.",3
"Worst changing actors or actresses","First 2 seasons was magnificent. Season 3 and 4 had tribble changing actors or actresses. How much a person grow old in 6 years? From 1963 to 1966 we should say mother of Claire Foy replaced her role. They are 10 years apart in age in real life. I had a connections to those actors from first 2 seasons, with changing them, the connections were torn. If in the show 15 years past I could say reasonable but not for only 3 years past.I gave this show 6 only for first 2 season. Although I like some of them but not in this role but one of them still good in this role like Tobias Menzies.We should remember The Tudors. The show with 1 actor from youth to old. Just makeup and art of acting.",6
"It's just so boring","I wanted to watch this show for years but was discouraged by its maturity rating until I found out it was one particular episode that gave it its obscene position. Realizing I could just skip that episode since I'd very much like to avoid vulgarities, I decided to finally sit and watch the show that so many have talked about - and might I say, the show was nowhere near what I expected. The stories are boring, and there really isn't a single character that I can wholeheartedly connect to, love, or even appreciate. I am someone that loves slow-burn stories, but my goodness did this show fail at it. There's such a lack of communication and dialog that are instead substituted with awkward and drawn out glances.I must admit a few things: - The last 3 episodes of the first season were pretty good, but I'd rather not sit through hours of boredom to get such a small reward at the end. I also absolutely loved the interactions between Churchill and his painter and the process of getting the portrait done. That entire episode was brilliant, but it's just a shame that the rest of the show can not be on par.Started the second season, but I doubt I'll watch more.",4
"Brilliant, beautiful, only wish it stayed more historically accurate","I love everything about this drama, the attention to detail is phenomenal. I only wish the story line was more historically accurate. The show would not be less interesting, there is plenty of interesting plot that is factually true. While I do think Diana was an innocent person in the love triangle that included Charles and Camilla I do think they also had their good points and that complexity should also be shown.",4
"What a bore!","I'm trying my best to sit through the third episode after turning off the first two before they ended.Sure, the sets are impressive, the photography pretty, and the uh, uh well there's nothing else I can praise.The performances are stilted, the characters totally unappealing, the intrigue petty, the objectives of the royalty self serving, and the pace agonizing.Bad, bad show.",4
"Season 1 is really good and then it goes down","Season 2 still very worth watching, S3 is mediocre and then S4 is really really weak. It becomes a blunt soap opera instead of the historical drama it was before, you never know if Coleman is serious or satirical in her acting.",5
"SERIOUSLY ???","Its been reported that £11,000 was spent in re-creating THE wedding dress, so what was that for ? Endless magazine shoots ? Because all we saw on screen was a close up of 'Diana's' face, and a long distance shot of the back of the dress as she walked away ! All that detail, time and expense for a rear view that lasted 15 seconds. Netflix must have money to burn, and those that spent weeks making the dress must have been pig sick not to have their work on show.Its an addictive watch, but it IS only a drama, - most of which never happened.The first few series and episodes were great to watch, but like others have said the last in the whole series is like a cheap soap opera.Biggest bugbear is the indoor lighting. All very medieval, and difficult to distinguish the action. Dingy, no colour, almost like a filter was over the lense. Horrible. At least there was blue sky and green trees on Margaret's island.",5
"So disappointed","Being a huge fan of Season 1-4, watching this was disappointing on so many levels.Yes, a lot of money has been spent without a doubt. The casting of Diana was beyond shocking. Of course nobody could ever live up to the real Diana but even disliking Kristen Stewart and he constant moody face, I'll admit she played this rôle brilliantly.I also find it interesting Harry had no problem selling his sole to Netflix, the very same network that tore his mother apart. I guess the only thing in common with this season of the Crown and Harry & MeanGirl is they are both full of 1/2 truths and lies, don't think I can continue either show.",4
"Time to put an end to this","Yes I loved this series from the beginning, brilliant actors and a great manuscript.However, the longer it goes, and closer to present days, it becomes more and more problematic. So many scenes are pure fictional or based on assumptions. But in the way its depicted it is easy to be interpretated as being a truth.As long Netflix refuses to make this clearer - this IS fiction, I can't watch it any longer.This is like a shiny new history book, easy to devour and love - but filled with guesses, rumours and plain fiction!I'm sad to see excellent actors like Imelda Staunton and Jonathan Pryce lend themselves to this!",1
"Were season's 1&2 writers been replaced???","I stopped watching by episode 3. Watching those first few episodes took major effort.
A major grating issue is how Emma Corrin ATTEMPTS to capture Diana's shy and coy mannerisms. She looks demented. Head movements are too fast and she rolls her eyes as if she is possessed by a demon. NOTHING remotely similiar to Diana.
With her second attempt, I had to turn it off.
Other low reviews have pretty much summed up the rest of this horrid season.",2
"Trashy and cheap","I only watched season 4 and lasted 3 episodes, the performances are supurb especially Margaret Thatcher, Princess Diane and Prince Charles and others but the dialogue and script is trashy ,cheap and mail on Sunday material ,definitely not for me.",4
"Faction presented as history which I think is dishonest and unfair","Claire Foy was great at conveying the powerful sense of duty of the young Queen Elizabeth. so two stars for that. Without her we are left with an attempt to invent the sensational and present it in an almost documentary format. I stopped watching when Olivia Colman took over.",2
"Worst Series","The worst tv series that i had ever watched in my lifde",1
"Don't Understand the Appeal","Am I the only person who finds this show dreadfully boring? Season after season characters stare at each other for long periods of time while the orchestra swells to crescendo. That is the formula now for 5 full seasons of drudgery.I'll give the technical team props as the set design, costuming, and cinematography are all excellent. The acting is fine in terms of talent although there have been several miscasts along the time jumps and the Dr. Who style of swapping out the cast every season (or other season) is distracting.I suspect the real reason I don't connect with the show is that I have zero interest in the British monarchy. All of their problems and drama are entirely manufactured to feel like crises because of one simple reason. They know they are fighting to stay relevant in a world that has moved well beyond them. Nearly every nation has rejected monarchy, even symbolically, and it's tiring that we continue to give attention to the last prominent royal family on earth.Thankful this show is finally coming to an end.",4
"Season 5","What I can't stand in particular with the British (actually English) culture is the brown-nosing towards the higherups. Now that Charles is king, let see for how long, the series is literally kissing up to Charles. They portray him as this misunderstood cool guy with this crazy wife but never mind the fact that Charles was 29 years old and Diana was 16 years when they met while dating her sister and having on-again and off-again relationship with Camila. The huge reason why princess Diana was so beloved was because she was human and knew the meaning of her role as a modern princess which meant connecting with the people while the royal family were very standoffish and trying to keep this allure of ""divinity"" from the Middle Ages.Unfortunately, I am not completely shock with the direction of the series since it is very common in England to suck their toes of those who have higher positions. England is a very classic country hence why the monarchy still exist.The only positive for me is the interior design of the homes.",1
"A sleeping pill","I only managed to watch season one, it was rather boring and uneventful. The hole thing ended right there for me. Maybe the other seasons are better, I will never find out.",2
"Carefully crafted","Cannot argue with the production...the settings, the casting, the depiction of history...but so far (up to now in the series) the royals have little redeeming value. As Tommy said, he was hired to protect the family from the public and he ended up protecting them from themselves. They are spoiled and dysfunctional. They are symbols, but of what? Part of their realm (Wales) is poor and suffering, and what do they do? They create the Prince of Wales who has to learn Welsh and give a speech. You'd think they'd round up a little money, like sell a few paintings, and bail out Wales But everything is about image and keeping secrets. It's pretty disgusting.",5
"Yes, it is a drama but it is close enough...","... to fact to further cement how much I despise Charles and Camilla. I thought Diana made a critical error marrying him, an attitude which continued to grow as time went on. He is - IRL and on the show - a massive PUTZ! A temperamental spoiled brat so completely selfish and self-involved it astonishes me that anyone might find him honorable. His only redeeming qualities including support for the arts and climate change are not enough to successfully counter his behavior for years! I was never a particular fan of the British royalty, I honestly did not much care about them one way or the other. However, my opinion changed somewhat when Diana's humanitarian actions became public in hopes she would be a good influence on the rest of them. A hope that was in vain with the exception of Prince Harry. I'm at the beginning of Season 5 which so many reviews panned, so it will be interesting to see if I agree... Not sure how much more I can stomach of Charles - he and his tart are bad enough in real life, I don't need them to ruin my entertainment as well so I may stop watching shortly.",4
"I stopped watching it based on principle.","Was a good show but for the record, when your lead actress wins Golden Globes and Emmy awards for their performance on the show, you don't re-cast even if that was your intended plan. Too many other shows to watch.",3
"Awful Royalist propaganda","I can't believe how much money Netflix has wasted on this show. Though Claire Foy is a fine actress, most of the other performance are weak, the script is poor and the direction dull. Though to be fair it's attention to historic detail is impressive but this is also it's biggest flaw, as it might lead people to think this was anything other than 300 level of fantasy. In order to inject some drama into they show the Liz 2 in political discussions and the like that simply haven't happened in the 20th century and really not since before the Hanoverian kings. It's obviously based on the twee American idea that is often pitched for tourism that the Queen is somehow still akin to something like the reign of Liz 1.Dull, huge waste of money. If you like Downton Abbey or Upstairs Downstairs (where incidentally Claire Foy was much better) then you might like this. Otherwise suggest switching to Amazon Prime, since Netflix has effective wasted it's budget to make anything else for the next few years!",1
"Overhyped","One of those shows that was massively hyped when it started and now seems to exist quietly in the background, loved by only a few.For me it lacks total historical accuracy, the people playing the key figures never look anything like them, and it's all a bit soap opera-esque.",2
"Something you need to know","While The Crown is well acted and filmed IT IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY. Series five takes massive liberties with the truth and were this not the Royal family (who never comment) Netflix would have been taken to court and forced to publish a multiple redactions. When reviewers say it 'chronicles' or is a documentary they are wrong. It's a dramatisation, a story, a confection.While The Crown is well acted and filmed IT IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY.

"So bad it feels like it was made in Sweden.","I've only seen the last season since I was forced to watch it with my wife who seen all other seasons.I usually enjoy watching series from Britain and the US but this one feels like the crap that's being made here is Sweden.There's a dancing scene at the Ritz that really grinds my gears. I had to hide my face in the pillow since I felt embarrassed for everyone involved, the actors and the people they portray.I will try the other seasons and maybe change my rating after that. Is I would rate GoT based on the last season I wouldn't make the series justice.My apologies for insufficient English.",2
"Too many liberties taken and incorrect portrayals.","Personally, I don't find any recreation of factual events and people realistic when the actors don't look or act anything like the real people, so I find The Crown impossible to watch. The few scenes I have seen have taken ridiculous liberties just to appeal to viewers. I could list the things that would never have happened in real life especially regarding the Queen and her duties and her reactions but the Crown wants to appeal to those who haven't got a clue about the monarchy, not that I am an expert, I just have common sense which the Crown does not!It's sad the actors and the writers think it's ok to make so much up just to create a popular tv show even when the facts don't support their version of the people and events. The writers must know some people will believe this dribble and think this show is based on facts because some of the events are factual but the version or narrative shown on The Crown is the opposite of the facts and dramatised and twisted for effect and this show has absolutely no Integrity.",2
"Inaccuracies everywhere","Whilst the series was clearly made for an American audience, it does not excuse the historical and factual inaccuracies throughout many episodes.If one views the series as a fictional representation, closely aligned to real people and events, then the show becomes watchable; it flows and the acting is, on the whole, quite good.From historical record, many of the show's relationships are incorrectly represented, some to a laughable extent, such as that between Queen Elizabeth II and Jackie Kennedy.It would appear the screenwriters made a conscious decision to ridicule and misrepresent certain members of the Royal Household, in particular Princess Margaret and Prince Philip, whilst depicting American President's as being of a higher intellect, more worldly and of greater importance to the world of the time - again quite laughable when one thinks of Lyndon Johnson or even JFK for example.The show just leaves me wondering what if ITV or Channel 4 made a similar series, but this time of American post-war Presidents, naturally for a UK audience not an American one. I can only imagine the feedback on a site such as this that it would receive.",1
"what about the colonialism?","I find it pretty whitewashed. Especially in terms of avoiding any account of colonialism. All the controversies attached to the royal family are of private manner. Adulteries and so on. Mighty boring and repetitive. The avoidance of history and focus on the family part in the 'royal family' term becomes especially visible in the second season and, I presume, will be more and more true in the seasons to come. Avoiding history and historical responsibility of the empire and its legacy makes 'The Crown' into another 'Dynasty-'like saga of the riches and dull.",5
"Awful casting decision ruined the experience","I was hooked on The Crown at first. I binged Seasons 1 & 2. The axting and production were excellent. But in Season 3, it came as a shock to see Olivia Coleman had replaced Claire Foy in the role of the queen. Now I'm a fan of Olivia's and have always enjotyed her work but her persona is radically different from Claire's. Honestly, I would probabl;y have reacted the same way if I'd become accustomed to Coleman in a role and been replaced by Foy. Any sense on continuity was lost. I got half way through Episode 2 in Season 3 before I stopped watching. The fact that it took that long is a testament to the quality of Seasons 1 and 2.",4
"Cast change in season 3","Bring back the the cast from previous seasons. I am sure with the right makeup artist they could have aged the cast from season 1 and 2 fittingly. So disappointed, I started watching the series as I thought it would be a good way learn about the history. It has now gotten so drab and boring.",5
"Finding season 4 to be the most boring show ever","I have watched all season of the Crown. Season 1&2 kept my interest. Season 3 had its moments. Season 4 is putting me to sleep. The overacting by some, the deadpan acting by others or the poor scripts have done me in. I lived thru these moments. Certainly wasn't boring when the events took place. I am almost done with season 4. I live in hope that with new actors and hopefully better scripts season 5 will be better.",4
"Pure and utter fiction - Not any fact needs to be labeled FICTION","It has turned from a great show with fantastic acting to a work of pure fiction pretending to be fact. As an Englishman I utterly admire and look up to my head of state The Queen. This is now a work of fiction.Please watch being aware you are watching great acting, great sets based on Not fact but a made up story line of fiction.If Netflix correctly label this a fiction I will make this an 8 or 9. But it is disgraceful that they leave many viewers with the idea this is fact or anything near fact.",2
"Even for voyeurism, it's not very entertaining","The one positive thing that I can say about the show is that it looks fantastic. The sets and costume designs are sweeping, masterfully executed and period-accurate, and the cinematography is extremely well done.All of which makes it doubly disappointing that such craftsmanship was wasted on such trashy show.The mere concept of The Crown is terrible. No matter how often the show's producers and defenders attempt to defend their shallow, tabloid-inspired approach to their subject matter as a fictional drama rather than an attempt at a documentary, the vapid, overwrought scriptwriting makes it clear that they believe they are writing for an audience who are too stupid to be able to make that distinction.And so, what we are left with is a show that pretends to be merely a fictional interpretation of real events, but which in reality portrays its subject matter with such a juvenile earnestness that it can only be meant to be taken as gospel. It hardly seems plausible, given how little the producers can actually know about the truth behind the events they are portraying. Either way, they are just purely dishonest.Even to someone such as myself, who is not the biggest fan of the royal family, this show comes across as a voyeuristic, reality-show-level melodramatic portrayal of their lives, with absolutely no effort made at honesty, subtlety or nuance. The Crown makes Regency costume dramas seem like high art by comparison.The scripts manage to be dense and glassy at the same time, where characters use entire paragraphs to expound on concepts that could be dealt with in a single sentence, but the producers clearly feel that all of the extra explication is needed in order to get their point across to their audience, whom, as I said, they clearly believe are morons. Perhaps they are right.",1
"Cringeworthy in places","Everything I have ever read about the Queen, especially after her passing, always commented on how kind and personable she was. Over and over again I read about her wicked and wonderful sense of humour amongst many other positive attributes and yet none of this comes across in the Crown.I know that this series is supposed to be a drama and not documentary however the portrayal of the Queen in this program did not do her justice. First of all, whoever was in charge of her style and dress sense should think about finding a new profession because she looks positively frumpy from series 2 onwards. Compounding this is the fact that she comes across as a bit of a sourpuss throughout much of the series. Neither of which bears any resemblance to reality.Just as the portrayal of the Queen was so inaccurate, the same could be said for Prince Charles in that he was made out to be a complete wimp with little or no backbone.Again I know that the Crown is not a documentary however it is a portrayal of real life people - in this case the Royal family - and in this case it absolutely did not do its members any justice.

"Didn't the King die actually while HMQ was going to Australia?","A little look at Wikipedia would have found this:On 31 January 1952, despite advice from those close to him, the King went to London Airport to see off Princess Elizabeth, who was going on her tour of Australia via Kenya. On the morning of 6 February, George VI was found dead in bed at Sandringham House in Norfolk. He had died from a coronary thrombosis in his sleep at the age of 56. His daughter Elizabeth flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II.I'm also sure the QM wasn't quite the weeping willow portrayed at the wedding!If they get that wrong in the beginning, why bother watching the rest?",1
"Utterly disgraceful from Netflix","Typical money grabbing rubbish from Netflix who prefer to invent stories than do any actual research. Season 4&5 are a travesty of modern television and as of this moment I have cancelled my membership and I will be urging everyone I know to do the same. The Queen has just left us and you bring out this crap. This unadulterated filth. A step too far and I believe that the decline for Netflix will continue as they lack good original content. The odd win - Stranger Things, altered Carbon, etc. - does not make or allow you to compete with Amazon, Disney and even Apple. This in tv terms is the third rail.",1
"Your mum might like it","As a regular Netflix binge watcher I feel compelled to review this new series based on Elizabeth II. I'm female, 22, a student and occasionally an alcoholic. I would not recommend this to anyone with respectable taste in TV. 43 minutes in to the first episode King George joins in with some local carol singers and I had to hold back sick. Apparently a huge budget was spent on this, probably a good shout from Netflix as Americans, Royalists and die-hard Tories will love it. Although I couldn't get through the first episode, I am confident that the rest of it will amount to an excruciatingly dull biography of the nation's favourite (?) poshos without even an incestuous story line to spice things up. I don't care how good the lighting, costumes, acting is etc etc, they could have saved 3million and made a more interesting show involving the Duke of Edinburgh and a litre of tequila. I have now lost respect for my housemate who recommended it. I could tolerate Downton (another one for establishment luvvies) until about Season 3 where I just wanted to punch Lord Whatsiname in the throat for trying to shag a maid.",5
"The political agenda in the last episode ruined the show for me","The dramatization and fictionalization of the history of the British monarchy was enjoyable and compelling in the beginning however over time the show became more shallow and frankly boring. I especially enjoyed the exploration of duty vs personal gratification and the way politics intertwined with the ethics and tradition of the monarchy. It seems too many folks watch this show as factual rather than historical fiction. The anti-monarchy monologue in the last episode completely ruined the show for me sadly as it appears the writers/producers had a political agenda- hence, the one star. Seriously, can we just have art that is not trying to make a statement once in awhile?",1
"What were they thinking?!?","How could casting get it SO WRONG? To change actors midstream was ridiculous! Not to mention using those who played a part as a different character in the 1st half of the series. Major fail.In 2016, there's simply no excuse to not take advantage of the advancements in stage makeup techniques, and age actors in a believable way. Claire Foy was a superb Queen, and I simply had no interest in learning what other characters has been butchered.I stopped watching at the end of season 2. What a shame, because I really enjoyed it. I may have been able to wrap my mind around the changes, but I was simply too annoyed to give them my rating, and they're undeserving of my time.",5
"Stupid decision to change the characters!!!!","I believe that was the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Who changes characters every 2 years to make them look older?? Hello hollywood, it's called makeup when you draw people in to a series it's because of the characters! As well as the storyline! So that's it after two seasons I'm finished I would not even recommend starting this series!! It's one thing when you change background characters, but to change the entire cast the main characters that we have come to love and watch in our homes every night I'm so disappointed I will not watch another episode now that you've changed all the characters! And I strongly recommend to everyone don't even start this series because when you get past season 2 you will be sorely disappointed with the new Queen Elizabeth actress!",1

"The Crown grows old.","While it is obvious that no expense was spared in making ""The Crown"", the dedication to fact is enough to cause the viewer to age just as the series progresses in near real time. It's slow moving progression and dedication to the British dialectic is a real drowse inducer. While the cinema photography is indeed impressive, it is not enough to carry the story. It is a mystery how this was filmed. Did they gain access to Buckingham Palace or reproduce it in a studio? Many questions are left unanswered as this is obviously an unauthorized biography. At the same time, the series is almost self consciousness about being factual, to the point of boredom. Do we really need to know that Elizabeth's father was embalmed inside Buckingham Palace?All in all, if you are a history nut or a Royal watcher, this show is for you. Otherwise, you might get bored, like I did, within the first three episodes with the tedious dialogue and never ending subplots, and just move on to something more interesting, like SVU.",5
"Snow Wife and Dwarfs","The airs of authenticity failed to smokescreen rigid, resentful, envy, power hungry and parochial character of Elizabeth Mountbatten.",3
"Good, thank you","I like it so much, it's really good. So good. I love it",1
"Good show but probably not for me","It's probably the rewriting of some historical events that most put me off. I usually care a lot about historical accuracy although I understand this is a drama and not a documentary. Or it might just be me as I have never been particularly interested in the dynamics of the British royal family.I don't quite understand the choice to change the cast in season 3 as only a few years have passed since the end of season 2, not enough to justify that ageing.
I liked the cast in season 1 and 2, and I feel in season 3 the new actors, especially the queen, made their own interpretations of their characters which were not very consistent with the previous seasons.Sure, the acting is good as well as the writing, the cinematography and the costumes, but I cannot shake the feeling that if a show of this quality had been instead centred around a less popular monarchy, it wouldn't have had nearly the same appeal.",5
"Dethroned...","My favourite bit was the final kung-fu duel between Zombie-Diana and the Queen aboard the exploding space-battleship Britannia...As a result of my wife's family incorrectly thinking I'm posh, I get constant questions about how ""true"" The Crown actually is. The answer is that if it is, it's a stopped clock - right periodically by pure chance. The problem for this
show is that the makers seem to want to juggle accuracy with historical fact and
telling a coherent and interesting story.Having much enjoyed the first four seasons of the Crown, I've found myself entirely disinterested in the first half of this season. I remember many of the historical events covered, along with all the speculation and discussions around them. The show's makers' have produced new stuff which isn't interesting and interesting stuff which isn't new. I'm not going to watch the second half of the season, mainly because I don't care and slightly because I'm disinterested in seeing made-up drama about the couple who will, God willing, be our next King and Queen.This is well made and well acted, particularly the parts of Diana and Mohammed Fayed/Al-Fayed. Imelda Staunton does well as the Queen but I cannot help remembering her character from Harry Potter and I kept expecting her to demand
the government crack down on ""mudbloods"". All in all, I wouldn't recommend this part of this season of the show. There are plenty of really well made documentaries about the death of Diana Spencer and Dodi Fayed which would be
more interesting to watch.I've seen a lot written by angry pundits about how this show is damaging because people believe that it's ""true"". That may well be the case, but most TV which isn't science fiction or fantasy attempts to portray itself as realistic, or at least authentic. The Crown is no more inaccurate than, say, Peaky Blinders - which is a fantastic show but, in terms of historical accuracy, might as well feature Tommy Shelby being proclaimed King of Mars for assassinating Hitler with steam powered laser...",3
"Horrible photography","The series and acting are fine but I hated the photography. It is low contrast, dull, fuzzy, smokey, foggy. It always seems like it is shot in the dimmest possible light indoors and the rooms always seem like they are filled with smoke or fog. Maybe that is supposed to be artsy but I don't like it. I've seen this""foggy"" photography in some other productions too.Colors are very muted and uninteresting. The exact opposite of the old Technicolor. My cell phone could have done a better job.A series like Downton Abbey looks 100 times better than the Crown.Sad that the photography detracted from a good series like The Crown.",5
"Disappointing!","The biggest disappointment for me was all the character changes. Some were excellent in their roles, others, meh. I just felt the casting was a disaster in many cases. Obviously so did much of the dialogue was fabricated and very unbelievable. And as usual, music portions were too loud. Volume button down, volume button up.Last note, the lady who played Anne in the last season looked so much like Margaret, I was constantly confused. How could the hundreds of people involved in this production not notice this.Anyway, I finally made it through this series which didn't hold a candle to Downtown Abbey in my opinion.",5
"Not a fan of nudity","Check out reviews before you watch this. Especially if you have morals about putting nudity in front of your eyes as a form of entertainment. Matthew 5:27-30 comes to mind. Apparently season 1 is more restrained than season 2. But the bad episodes in season 2 are REALLY bad. Let the buyer beware!",1
"Season 1 was superb, Season 2 ok though a bit stretched but Season 3 depicts too many lies","I loved Season 1 of The Crown. Acting and scenery was superb (8 stars).Season 2 started to show some ""romanticization"" of history and thus for me was a bit of a let down (4 stars)But Season 3 is now really off the chart for fact checking ! The writing is over simplisitic about events that shaped the characters (Kennedy's episode is just a farce) like the writers didn't find any ideas other than antagonizing the royal family to any one else (depicting american astronauts like idiots). Relation between Prince Charles and the Duke of Windsor is totally wrong (there were no letters!). The problem is : people are going to believe what they see ! And this IS NOT reality. What is the motive behind this ? (2 stars).",4
"A Royal Bore","To be fare, I would never, ever, ever, EVER, watch anything like this - no action, explosions and/or car chases. Ah but the one who controls the TV, controls the world - and that isn't under my charge. My wife commandeered the TV, and I could not change the channel under the menacing threat of physical castration, which didn't really matter, since it only took one and a half episodes to realize I suffered psychological castration anyways. I guess if one can't help gobbling up voyeuristic lies and/or can't get enough of royal dribble, this baby's for you. The dialogue was horribly boring, the plot I guess is ok, and those 'Harry Potter' actors were, great. Why so low of a grade? I'm no fan of melodramas, especially fake-factual ones. One sided views are always damaging to the other side. Anyways - not my cup of tea. This is a English, British, U. K. thing - who I respect greatly, but it's their laundry - dirty or clean - I do not think they were treated fairly.",3
"Don't like","In season 1 I don't like the part when they were killing living things such as ducks. And it's a little slow",3
"Drags on","A bit too slow. It drags on. I fast forwarded through the show which Is not something I usually do",5
"A soap with history lessons built in!","I did not know all that much about Queen Elizabeth's reign because, frankly, I have no interest in monarchies. The Crown is very well done and I was surprised at how much i learned,. It inspired me to read further. I'm sure much of it is dramatized but that's what makes it entertainingI got used to the new cast. It bothered me a little but I got over it, especially as I think Olivia Coleman is fantastic. The new Crown cast won me over.I take off one star for the boring soliloquies during season 3., especially one by Prince Philip. Painful! They went on a little too long and I lost interest.
Overall, I cant wait for season 4!!!!",4
"A Let down","Remember this is a fictitious drama, not a documentary. In this season 5, the actors are mis-cast. They should have kept the fist cast and just aged them. These actors don't resemble the royals at all! I had to read the captions to understand whom I was watching.Perhaps the show will explore the shifts the Britons feel about maintaining the crown. Its an expensive myth to keep energizing. The royals are remote except for Diana. Im not sure Dominic West, a great actor, really fits Prince Charles quiet demeanor, the first actor did down to the big floppy ears, lol. Maybe the choice of the cast depends on who are the stars of the day to sell an interest on netflix who are putting out mediocre shows most rate 5 or 6.",5
"Wonderful start but awful casting for season 6","I enjoyed the first 5 seasons a lot, they were convincing, beautiful, wonderful. But season 6 is dissapointing. It is not enough to have good actors if they cannot be seen as the characters they represent. ""Charles"" is completely different to the real one, both in face, in body movement, in attitude. Philippe is weird too, as some others.As said, I really enjoyed the first 5 seasons. They are great: the story, the actors, the places... everything looks so real. But now, it's being quite difficult for me to follow the story with the new cast. I really don't see a reason why they have made these choices. They are too close in time to be so different.",5
"Gosh!","I quite liked the first few episodes but it's not really my thing. In season 4 - which I started because of all the publicity - the accents are awfully quair. Ay'm british and quaite well eduwcated but golly gosh ay em larghing!",5
"Boring","Gave up season 1 episode 7. It's very dull and couldn't stand the posh accents and characters any longer. Prince Phillip in particular was portrayed as a cocky twat. What's true, what's fiction?",4
"Hmmm... The animals in Africa are good","People are raving over this and a friend recommended it. I'm not seeing the 9 and 10 stars here. It's okay as long as you're not expecting any kind of historical accuracy. I actually found most of the characters tiresome in the extreme. Yes, it's pretty to look at and some of the settings are lavish (if you like dark, over-stuffed and decorated rooms) but, let's face it, if this lot weren't royalty, we'd tell them to get on with it like the rest of us do.
I haven't made it to the Coronation and won't be. 24:57 into S1:E3 and that's enough of my life wasted. Once you've seen the animals, turn it off!",5
"Another PR job","The truth of the inglorious empire colonial rule has been completely avoided. Era of darkness",2
"A Series That Needed More Work","I completely understand what the crew were thinking and trying to do when they were creating this series but it did nor exactly fully work unfortunately. This series was confusing and disappointing and could have been a lot better and stronger. The storyline throughout this entire series was too simple and did not have any real direction. The cast selection throughout this entire series could have been a lot better and stronger. They did not at all commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was no chemistry at all displayed throughout this series between the cast members.",1
"Better than most but...","There is no wonder why this production is so highly rated. But I don't follow suit for a couple of reasons.The acting is superb. The visuals are exquisite. The physical appearance of actors, a tribute to the makeup and wardrobe artists. And so much more we might want to laud.But there are two things troubling me. The first is that we might tend to forget this is largely the writers conjecture and we could believe what we are seeing and hearing is actually true. Let is not forget it may not be so.To back up my thoughts about the accuracy is my second point. In the last episode of the sixth season we have a characteristic of the industry agenda take place. While posing for the family portait at Charles and Camilla's wedding, Prince Phillip let's loose with a blasphemy and no one posing for the photo reacts in the least. Quite the Hollywood message!",5
"Good Program - Horrible Soundtrack","Honestly, we would like to rate the Crown with a 9 or 10 but are hard pressed to do so because the soundtrack really messes up a great production. Just began to watch Season 2 on Netflix. The stories do not have quite the charm as Season 1 but QE has settled into being Queen and he problems are now more modern. This season seems to be more about family and marriage relationships. Prince Philip draws sympathy as one who is not ready to be a true nobody - which is all it seems a royal can be. Season 2 also has the drawback of having no John Lithgow who was marvelous in Season 1. We did wish form more on the political crisis and less on the life of Margaret which seems to be the weakest part of the story. Too much time on her snivelling is what we believe.But the really big downfall is the sound track. First the mix is atrocious. No, it is worse than that, much worse. Dialogue is often buried beneath sound effects. It is a noisy movie and when a quiet place would be nice what passes for music is ear numbing drone of various tone instruments. Like no music was actually scored to fit the time and style. This kind of terrible sound is a trend and not just here but in many current productions. It is our guess that the sound (where there used to be orchestrated music pieces) is generated by a computer and nothing more than formula synthesizer. And we don't mean the 70 and 80 style Moog. This is simply sound used as fillers because there are no good composers left or no money in the budget to hire them. It is the most expensive production for Netflix so it is likely just what we expect. Problem is it is so distracting it's annoying beyond the ability to bear it. Thank goodness for the mute button which we use frequently between dialogue sequences.",5
"Lackluster Season 6","I have enjoyed all the previous seasons of The Crown and the acting has been superb. However I just finished wathcing season 6 and I have to say I was disappointed. Where did all the scenes with Elizabeth and Philip go and the final season of this series portrays their relationship as somewhat cold. I really liked Dominic West's portrayal of Charles. I didn't know at first in season 5 but he grew on me. Season 6 clearly tries to portray Prince Harry as the bad guy---were they influenced by recent events?? Who knows but I think that was a little over the top. The season 6 storylines could've been a little meatier in my opinon. I was really let down in the finale. Maybe it should have ended at season 5 as originally planned.",4
"nice","Nice. It's very good and too much beautiful.Very important, historical, romantic, family, nice and light.",1
"season","Only reason i am writing:-Too violent opening season 5 ep 6-Perhaps for your game of throne audience, but for someone who watches this show because their is no violence or scenes are more tasteful, why did you be so graphic ??!!-Disappointed and disgusted.-Generally, I really enjoyed the whole series, and different perspectives. Taking historical events with an artful account, more geared towards the PBS style audience-Perhaps someone's judgement was thinking why not through horrific violent deaths in the middle age woman's face? Perhaps audience members who work with real world trauma daily , would like a break at night and not be surprised by vivid graphic death scenes?!!!!",5
