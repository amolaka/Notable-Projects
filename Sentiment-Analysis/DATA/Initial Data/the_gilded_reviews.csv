"It's not Downton Abbey, and that's a good thing","There are a metric ton of poor reviews for the Gilded Age, most of which seem disappointed that it's not Downton Abbey. Of course it's not. Nor is it Gosford Park, Belgravia, The English Game, Doctor Thorne, nor any number of other series and movies that the Baron Fellowes of West Stafford has written or produced.The Gilded Age is best reviewed as a stand-alone series, and not any sort of spin-off or successor to the immensely successful Downton Abbey. Yes, the costumes and sets are spectacular, and the casting is sublime, led by the magnificent Carrie Coon (not ""Coons"", good grief. If you're going to put down her acting, the very least you can do is spell her name correctly). Other standouts are Morgan Spector, as robber baron. George Russell, and the always entertaining Nathan Lane, Cynthia Nixon and particularly Christine Baranski, as the witty, but sharp tongued Aunt Agnes.It's not necessarily the best show on television, but it's far from the worst, and an easy binge watch, with consecutive story arcs that are well conceived and written. It's not historical drama, it's a costume drama, with a superb cast, and tightly scripted dialogue. It's not Downton Abbey, nor does it pretend to be. It is, however, a peek into the extravagant lives of the very rich in Post Civil War America.",8
"Hilarious period dramedy","Downton Abbey was about upstairs/downstairs affairs in the UK, while this dramedy is about old money/new money in America.I found the writing hilarious. It's a dry, witty drama with many laugh out loud moments, although one needs to listen closely to notice them. This is not in your face, but subtle.The costumes are gorgeous and the acting superb, as you'd expect from HBO and the big names involved.Some of the previous reviewers commented that they didn't like how woke the show was, but I didn't notice that. As far as I could tell, gender and race issues are treated with historical accuracy.I love this new show and can't wait for more episodes.",9
"The crumbling of manners in New York city...","Julian Fellowes' mighty pen is back (and even more cheekier) in this lavish production. This time dealing with aristocratic socialite snobbery of the ugly kind, ruthless business affairs, political sabotaging, hidden homosexual relationships, racial prejudices, and society control freaks. (But I'm sure there is more after only viewing three episodes.)And we're talking about the year - 1882! A radical period in New York upper-society with the changing of the guard among the wealthy, and the young radical breed coming into play. All carried out in the delicious Fellowian style. With snappy and sassy dialogue, infused with a grand soap opera worthy of a Verdi music score.",8
"I love New York","I'm really enjoying this show. Don't know what took me so long to start watching it, but here it is December 2023 and I've started watching season one. I love period dramas and this one is no exception. Most of the period pieces are British which is great but a New York point of view is refreshing, The best part about this show is that it's not a slow burn. Something happens in every episode. I am so tired of Netflix slow burns where nothing happens and an 8 episode series could boil down to one or two episodes.. This one keeps me interested. I really enjoy the costumes. Wow the dresses are just gorgeous and the homes and furnishings are beautiful. I mean could you imagine having money and living in a time like that.",10
"Wonderful!","What's not to like? Fabulous sets, beautiful and authentic costumes, Broadway actors, and an intriguing story line. This isn't something to over-analyze; just enjoy it!!",9
"Phenomenal cast and twisty tales!","Love this story line. The cast of characters with focus on the hot tempered Mrs. Russell and Aunt Agnes, two very different people from different sides of the street per se, yet so similar in so many ways. The stubbornness to stand their ground in their beliefs to uphold their standards of living. One from a time silly being forgotten and the other making a point to bring New York into modern times.Being able to see the struggles of the rich and powerful, to the adversities of the poor and the black citizens of old America that still have some presence in today's society is all put together in this extremely well put together series!",10
"Love this drama","Really enjoyed watching this drama and hope they continue to season 3. Characters are intriguing and interesting. My favourites are Miss Ada and Marion as well as a soft spot for Agnes. There are characters you can love and hate. Really had no idea about the con Oscar would fall for and hope that a comeuppance will occur. If you liked downtown abbey then this is a must.I am really holding a hope for Marion and Larry in the romantic sense as well as Gladys eventually standing up to her mother. The one storyline I wish they would develop more and give her a story she deserves is Peggy Scott as well as I wish the we find out that Marion's railway shares are not worthless and build a story round that as well.",9
"Easily triggered? Then don't watch","Reading some of these reviews is almost as entertaining as the show itself. Some proclaim to love Downton Abbey (which by the way also raised sensitive issues such as class, heritage and sexuality) but when it makes a small subplot in an American show - the trolls emerge proclaiming ""no, no 'woke' stuff.""Anyway: The first episode is long but it does a good job of setting the stage. Love Baranski, Nixon did a fine job, Farmiga was not the right choice. Although I adore Coon as an actress (I'll never forget her performance in Leftovers), she didn't get to really flex in this role, yet.I eagerly await the continuation and will update my rating as the season moves on. Which it will as I am sure irritates quite a few but gives the majority of us no reason for concern.",8
"Beautifully Produced and Written","This show works as a fantastic fantasy where you imagine yourself as one of the rich and noble of Gilded Age New York.It's beautifully written, full of colorful characters that each feel as motivated and purposeful as all the others. Their lives are fleshed out and their potential for stories is always taken to its limit.Even though my own circumstances are about as far from the lives of these people as is possible, the show still managed to get me to feel for and understand the mentality and feelings of all the characters.Not every sub plot is a knockout and not every interaction is engaging, but it's one of the more consistent writing jobs done in this genre.Beyond the exceptional writing, it's a beautifully produced show. The costumes on particular are fantastic! Every episode brings a new set of special dresses to admire. And the sets.... Absolutely gorgeous. This is arguably the best show of it's kind in terms of production design.All around, I wasn't expecting much when I initially turned it on but I was very pleasantly surprised. It's fantastic.",8
"I don't get all the bad reviews...","I've been waiting this for a while, especially since Fellowes mentioned it, I knew the premise could deliver a good show, and so it is. I'm giving it a 7* for the time being for I know it could be an 8 but I will reserve judgement until the end of the season.Plus, all Fellowes' dramas are slow burners, even Downton Abbey was a bit much at first, there were dozens of characters presented at once, nothing made much sense until episode 3 so I knew what to expect on that regard but I want to make a defense, should that be the word, of this series. Aside of minor mistakes, façades not being the right stone, streets missing small details, the show presents the age rightly, especially one that was written a lot about, and mostly from a women's feud views. The men offer the backside of this, they didn't care about their wives' issues, they make business in between each other and let them manage the social side of their lives.The show is heavily inspired from Alva Vanderbilt's takedown on Old New York, her bid on becoming socially acceptable agains Mrs Astor's 400, the Knickerbockers. Old ways vs the new way, Americans, especially Newyorkers, finding their footing in the new order where the US was beginning to be a power in its own right, and so, then, of course, the Buccaners, the most famous 3: Minnie Stevens, Jennie Jerome, and Consuelo Vanderbilt, the first 2 ones ran away from NY due to the lack of acceptance their families had, Alva was of a sterner material, first she won at home, and then she placed Consuelo as a duchess in England. Shortly after she divorced her husband, marry the love of her life, and then became an activism for women rights, vote, etc. What a woman, ha!I also disagree with those who refer to this as woke, luckily is not, Fellowes loves to introduce these ""downstairs"" stories, and it is going to be one of the lines to go, so I like that, he is also usually thorough when it comes to details, I mean, don't expect seeing Peggy marrying a Vanderbilt or an Astor, he does not play with history on that regard but there will some surprise there for sure.I hope this one follows its course, it could run for 4 season easily, and more.",7
"Love it!","Visually stunning, great stories, so engaging. Just what I needed. Kudos to Julian Fellows on another hit. In spite of some users on IMDB not liking the show, it's a hit!!! Like Mrs. Russell, it will prevail.",10
"TERRIBLE casting and directing","First of all, the main character Marion Brooks is supposed to be 17/18. I. Real life this actress is 30 and looks it. Why not cast a genuine ingenue like Bridgerton did, and make it more credible?! Louise Jacobson is a pretty girl but she is not a radiant 18 year old carrying the storyline here.Secondly the dialog is ok but the delivery is very modern. Awful. No subtlety or nuance or modulated voices. OMG where is Maggie Smith when you need her?!Lastly, the characters thus far are caricatures of their historical referents. The ruthless
mogul, the intractable snobbery, the guileless out-of-towner, etcOverall, as compelling the sets and costumes, it is fighting against the flat delivery of dialog and predictable plot thus far.",6
"Great sets, terrible writing, wooden acting.","Downton Abbey had talented actors and well-crafted scripts. The Gilded Age has neither of those. I kept waiting for it to hit its groove, but that hasn't happened yet. The characters are just not interesting, the actors have no emotion or attachment to the story line. The dialogue is stilled and sometimes moronic. It does have great sets and special effects, but not nearly good enough to offset the horror show that is the script.",2
"Great acting, nice story line, but historically implausible","1) the show is beautifully shot2) great acting3) nice story lines4) the crux of the dramatic conflict is, a class conflict between the ladies of old line New York, between the ladies of new money New York.5) This is an excellent adaptation of actual NYC history;a) the Dutch families, not the Mayflower families, had antecedence in NYC, notably the Roosevelts;b) New Money had many adherents and advancements socially & otherwise in 1876-1929 more than any other period in time-the Morgans, Rockefellers, et al. All were new money.C) Pedigree never trumped money, especially in the ""Gilded Age,"" which was named for the enormous fortunes made in banking, railroads, Gold, shipping & other endeavors not taken up by the old established families.However, these are but small quips.Consider the minor roles occupied by such great actors as;1) Michael Cerveris (September in Fringe)2) Taissa Farmiga, excellent here as Gladys Russell3) Jeanne Tripplehorn, as Sylvia Chamberlain, excels4) Cynthia Nixon, as Ada Brook is terrific.I could go on and on, but this is one terrific show.This show concentrates much more on social status, social circles and the women of the Gilden Age than upon economics, labor, or the general corruption of the Gilden Age.To enjoy this show, one must suspend the historical-dialectic judgments and focus on the plot as presented---and then you enjoy it!It's a great show, enjoy!",10
"Amazing show with enticing storylines","The Gilded Age is a phenomenal drama with a wonderful cast. The setting of NYC in the Gilded Age touches on a bygone era that is well portrayed for all social classes during that time. The cast are all superb. The characters are rich and interesting from the upper class to the working class. I love the interactions between sisters, Ada and Agnes. The injection of historical events of the time into the show allows for viewers to see what the world around these characters was like during this time period. The attention to detail in architecture and the clothing is one of the best things about the show. The season 2 season finale was phenomenal and I was smiling the entire time I watched it! Hoping for a season 3!",9
"Still Watching and Waiting for More","Always takes a while for a series like this to introduce the characters and core structure and that is true here. What matters of course is if the audience is hooked enough to look forward to the next episode and this viewer certainly is.",9
"From a Girl Who Typically Prefers Sci-Fi","This show is absolutely amazing! It draws you in from the very first few seconds and holds your attention throughout. You find yourself so caught up in the narrative that when the episode is over, you wonder how that's possible because it feels like it just started.If you like the older period pieces, and you like watching how the upper class lived around the turn of the century (early 1900s), you're in for a treat with The Gilded Age. Not only does this show have a stellar cast with actors who came from the theater (which gives them an edge with this type of drama because it sets the tone that makes this show so riveting), but you can actually feel the tension between the ""new"" and the ""old"" New York money.Treat yourself and watch this series!! You won't be disappointed!",10
"A Study in Class","I found the first episode of The Gilded Age very crisp and fresh. I admit that I have not been a big fan of Cynthia Nixon in the past, but her performance in this series is exquisite and truly shows an acting ability that I haven't seen in her previous roles.The casting is very good and with so many likeable characters, this show is sure to delight those of you who enjoy period dramas.",10
"C'mon Julian, get it together!","I love Downton Abbey so much that during shut down I binged it for a second and third time. I'm also a huge fan of Christine Baranski, so I was really looking forward to this new series. I haven't been happy with it and after the second episode I realized why. There are few endearing characters like there are in Downton Abbey, and Christine Baranski plays a relentlessly cruel, obnoxious snob, displaying almost none of the delicious wit that she usually shows. The other characters are poorly fleshed out so far. All this is the fault of the writer; I don't know what he was thinking beyond laurel-resting. I'm going to give it a few more chances, but if something doesn't improve it will never make it to season two, at least for me.",6
"Entertaining Show","I am enjoying The Gilded Age and will continue to view weekly. We are still in the process of being introduced getting to know the characters. Julian Fellow's knows how to weave a tale so I suspect the story will get more complex as the series unfolds.",10
"One of my favorite genres is the ""Costume Period Piece"" !","One of my favorite genres is the ""Costume Period Piece"" .'Downton Abbey' creator Julian Fellowes turns his eye from British opulence to New York City circa 1882 for a look at America's empire-on-the-rise. The Gilded Age is set in and around New York during the 1880s. The title refers to this time of prosperity in the United States thanks to the industrial boom, and the show will follow the comings and goings of the upper echelons of New York's high society during that time.At the heart of new historical drama, The Gilded Age, is breakout star Louisa Jacobson. The 30-year-old newcomer plays Marian Brook in the HBO series alongside Carrie Coon, Cynthia Nixon and Christine Baranski.For Jacobson, whose mother just so happens to be Meryl Streep, the role marks her series debut. Jacobson, who uses her middle name to distinguish herself from her famous family. Prior to making her debut, the youngest of Streep's four children studied psychology at Vassar College before attending British American Drama Academy in Oxford and later earning a Master of Fine Arts in Acting from the Yale School of Drama. She is a delight to watch !Denee' Benton is superb in her role, a middle-class, 19th-century determined young woman and a gifted writer living in New York City in the 1880s.Nowhere near the depth and feeling of Downton Abbey lets face it! Downton was lighting in a bottle ( Mr. Pamuk dying of a heart attack in series one in Lady Mary's bed) that was pure T. V. gold ! But Fellowes gives you smartly written characters, filmed in lavish sets and costumes, an able cast in this Americanized spin on his beloved ""Downton Abbey'. If you like this sort of programming 'The Gilded Age' is perfectly addicting .The time period is a fabulous frame for character-driven stories of social maneuvering. Season two can not come soon enough.",7
"Great cast","This show depicts a lifestyle from a world away. The sets and the costumes are incredible. The storyline appears to be going in several interesting directions. Watch the show and see for yourself. Disregard the ignorant views of those who admit that they haven't watched it and won't!",9
"Excellent first episode","The sets and the clothes are tremendous. The style of the show is very Julian Fellowes; they are trying to hit all the familiar notes. It isn't fair to judge any show in this era after just one episode, especially one with so many characters and potential moving parts but I would say it is off to a great start. The first episode was a bit stiff as it was full of introductions and context setting. Downtown Abbey also took time to get beyond being a stock British costume drama.People who loved Downton and are complaining about stiff acting and dialogue might reflect on the fact that many of those characters we grew to love were pretty wooden in the beginning. Bates, Branson, Edith, Carson... we're pretty lame and took time to develop. Give it time.And I love the reviews complaining that they don't like these elitist rich people with snotty accents. Here's a tip: it's called The Gilded Age....",9
"Simply Enchanting","Comparisons are odious and those comparing this stunning period drama to Downton Abbey have lost the plot.There is no comparison to be made. One is set in England and the other is set in New York. One is about one family and the other features several households.The Gilded Age is a snapshot of life in life late 1900s and features issues of class, racism, social climbing, and the petty rivalries of the very well-heeled of the day.The cast is stellar, headed by Carrie Coon. Christine Baransky and Cynthia Nixon are splendid in the respective roles of Aunt Agnes and Aunt Ada. I was surprised to learn that the youngest daughter of Meryl Streep makes her debut as the glue that holds the show together in a pivotal role as Marian Short. She acquits herself admirably.The costumes are breathtaking especially those worn by Ms Coon. Those who criticise how clean the streets are need to remember that the exceedingly rich would not live in squalid surrounds.The second season dealt with strikes, scabs, racial prejudice, marriage, death, and the ever-present, snobbery and one-upmanship that the genteel classes had time to indulge in.There is no comparing the two shows. Both are excellent and stand alone. Bravo, Mr. Fellowes for bringing them to life. I loved both seasons and can't wait for season 3.",10
"Stunning, opulent and twisted","This period piece is delightful with opulent sets and costumes! Truly stunning works of art and twisted plots galore. The acting is fabulous! The old money versus new money theme is always a dilemma of the ages.",10
"For lovers of costume period drama","I loved this series and hope a third season will be commissioned. The sets and costumes's are delightfully extravagant and pull you back in time to such opulent living.Good story lines between the upstairs and downstairs, though this is mainly focussed upstairs with new money vs old.Love the characters, fantastic acting with Cynthia Nixon being a standout amongst so many great performances. I will likely watch this again, just so good.I have ready many reviews that compare this to negatively Downtown Abbey, which it is not, it has taken a different more lavish path. But if you enjoy period drama, you are likely to enjoy this.",10
"Not my normal cup of tea but drink it I did","I lean into thrillers, sci-fi, crime/legal dramas etc., but if you told me I'd get pulled into a period drama full New York City ""society"" pomp, catty undercutting, social climbing, and an endlessly deep preponderance of pretentiousness, I would have immediately said: ""You got the wrong guy! That is not not my Hermès bag!""This series is all of those aforementioned things made whole and enjoyable with excellent story and fantastically lovable and despicable personalities sometimes all rolled into a single character.I will pick one of my favorites in the show that blindside me: Cynthia Nixon!!!Her turn as Ada floored me. She played a hard mannered Federal Official in ""Hannibal"" and she was fantastic. Now she plays a lovable aunt and I can't get enough of it... her range is magnificent - she's always been one of my favorites. Of course Christine Baranski is fantastic. Honestly, I have a hard time finding anyone out of place in the cast.I find this show wholly enjoyable, and that's coming from someone that slept through ""The Crown"" and, out of boredom, set small fires in the house when my wife turned on ""Downton Abby"".One episode and out is shortsighted. So, take a chance, and let soak in.",9
"Style without substance","On the surface this show has everything one would expect from the creator of Downton Abbey- luscious settings and costumes, great period detail, an awareness of social issues- but it lacks a key element. The writing is sub par. The dialog is overly expository as if it has to explain every detail verbally instead of letting the characters develop naturally. The actors, even the ones who are usually quite good (and trying their best here- Cynthia Nixon and Christine Baranski) cannot get past the blank declarations of their characters status and motivations. There's no subtlety here. The only character who is allowed to have any realistic expression is Peggy Scott. The others are mostly cardboard cutouts of real people particularly the social climbing Russells.",7
"Highly Engaging","This series is written by Julian Fellowes, who also developed Downton Abbey. Like Downton Abbey, The Gilded Age is a period drama. It's set in ca 1880s; it's about class - there's a clear upstairs and downstairs, and an old money vs. Nouveau riche. Where it's markedly different is that there's conflict on a bigger scale, and it's more centered around social class. Instead of focusing on one family, it's focused on two: one old money family, the Van Rhijns, who are accepted at the highest levels of New York society, but feeling the financial pinch; and one very new money family, the Russell's, who have tremendous wealth, but are striving to be accepted by NY society. This creates a very well defined path of conflict as the Russell's leverage Mrs Russell's tactics and George Russell's money and strong arm methods to achieve social victories. Meanwhile their neighbor Agnes Van Rhijn is stuck in a paradigm of social propriety, and attempts to control her brow beaten sister Ada Brook, her closeted son Oscar, and her recently arrived niece Marian. Having just walked into this world from a middle class life in Pennsylvania, Marian is a central character as she navigates the system and tries to build a new life in NY. Of course, while Agnes Van Rhijn and Mr & Mrs Russell dislike each other, the younger members of both families are friendly with one another and become close. Alongside the lives upstairs are the lives downstairs. Each house has a staff below the stairs whom we get to know quite well, and who bring their own problems and stories. Indeed, the butlers have a tense rivalry with one another before calling a truce in season 2.Another story stream involves a young black woman, Peggy Scott, who Marian meets on her way to NYC. Peggy becomes a secretary for Mrs Van Rhijn and then finds work as a journalist for a black newspaper. Through her and her family we get to see the world of middle class black people at the time - a world Marian wasn't expecting. And on a trip to Alabama during which Peggy and her editor are chased by a lynch mob, we watch her come to terms with how privileged she's been living in NY as compared to black people dealing with dangerously open racism in the south.All of these interpersonal issues are set against things going on during the period: black lives post civil war, the establishment of the Tuskegee Institute, the rise of industrialists, the labor movement, the conflict that led to the founding of the Metropolitan Opera, etc. So the series makes for a lesson in social history.As a production, the costumes and sets are absolutely fabulous. I think it's fairly well cast - there are some roles where I thought they could do better. There were very few actors I'd seen before, which can be a good thing. (I think they used a lot of theatre actors.) Carrie Coon as Bertha Russell, Christine Baranski as Agnes Van Rhijn, and Cynthia Nixon as Ada Brook were perfect. Nixon surprised me, and she and Baranski had good chemistry. Denee Benton was also great as Peggy Scott. Some people have criticized the choice of Louisa Jacobson as Marian Brooks, but I thought she was right for the role. The only role I thought was terribly cast or perhaps acted, was Nathan Lane as Ward McAllister - a sort of social currency broker. I usually like him in anything, but his southern accent was just god awful; just kind of ruined the ambiance.I'm looking forward to season 3.",9
"... early-days ... nothing yet outstanding or terrible",".. early to tell yet so far so good... nothing much new in the story.. but acting is up to the task, and it's interesting to see Streep's youngest daughter take to the small screen... we'll see how it goes.",7
"Sadly not a success","Like most viewers I looked forward to this series. So it saddens me to say it is not very good. The writing and dialog are stilted and rarely sound like something human beings of any age might actually say. This problem results in acting which ranges from acceptable to dreadful. Some of th characters spew lines rather than speak or relate them. The weakest links is Louisa Jacobson, daughter of Meryl Streep. This is her first role and she simply and sadly is not up to the challenge. Her performance is wooden and on the level with a high school production. As her character is the focus of the early episodes the result is a poor performance which harms all the others and the story. The supporting characters suffer the same fate. Rapid fire delivery of clunky dialog. I was surprised by Cynthia Nixon who makes her character believable even sympathetic. Christine Baranski is saddled with lines which are supposed to be witty but come off as brittle and leaden. She offers then with great theatrically. The sets look great so enjoy the view, it's the best you can hope for.",3
"A peaceful haven in a world of fleeting passions.","It's so different from all of the rest of latest period dramas like Bridgerton, and even Sanditon. It's a good old period drama, where good always wins, but with enough ""drama"" to keep you involved and excited. The cast is nice and diverse, the wardrobe is beautiful. It's new world meets old world kinda intrigue.And it's just nice, and doesn't make you stressed. Characters are mostly kind and good-natured, there's not a single character you truly hate. It's definitely not steamy, it very PG13 in that aspect, but it reminded me of old BBC period dramas.Highly recommend and can't wait for the next season to arrive.",9
"Zippy & Snappy . . . .","This show was a surprise. I really wanted to watch a TV series I could binge a bit, which means to me watching episodes over a period of weeks or months, but this one I finished in a week. All the 50-minute episodes, with commercials, seemed to last no more than 30 minutes. I guess that means I found the episodes absorbing, even though the story lines aren't terribly exciting.Unlike other reviewers, I found many of the characters quite interesting, both upstairs and downstairs. Agnes, Ada, Bannister, Peggy, Gladys, and on and on. Cynthia Nixon surprised me because I had never seen her in anything, but had read about her in newspaper and magazine articles, always imaging her to be a tough cookie type. In this series, she is a most believable sweet and kind soul.Christine Baranski is the tough cookie on the show and provides never-ending wit and laughs, as does Nathan Lane as the very Southern Ward McAllister. The downstairs characters also provide many laughs, one of the funniest being when the truth is learned about French chef Monsieur Baudin.Violence is limited and I warn Julian Fellows he better keep it that way! If any woman in this series is shown raped and beaten, as what happened in Downton Abbey, I will stop watching. That's not to deny the reality of the times, but this is a fun escape-reality type of show and needs to remain that way. We've already had a death, as well as poor Bridget's sad story, and don't need lots more tragedy.George and Bertha? I often dislike them for their ruthless natures, but don't always dislike them. I think that means Morgan Spector and Carrie Coon are doing a fine job creating complex characters who do get some sympathy. Both their children are quite likable, too, not at all ruthless or overly ambitious.Peggy and her family? It's a good twist to show a black woman of the time period who comes from a professional family, instead of growing up in a shack. Her father owns a pharmacy and her parent's home is beautiful. There are still prejudices shown in New York City, however, which is good since a terrifying racist incident is shown when Peggy visits the South; and it's always laughable when movies and TV shows make it seem like hatred of blacks only existed in the South, during any time period in history.Thus, I would recommend this series to anyone who likes period pieces, and wants to view the battle between old money and new money. No, everything isn't exactly how it was in reality in 1800s New York City, but, once again, this is an escape-reality type of show, not a documentary. It is educational to a point, too, such as showing the events where the Brooklyn Bridge was opened, and The New York Times building was lit up by Thomas Edison. This series is obviously not meant to be dark and gritty, but decorous and lively.P. S. I love the soundtrack, too!",9
"A pleasant surprise!","I've have been a long time reader, and fan of Julien Fellows. I always loved Downton, and had my favorites on the show, however while it is fun to visit that period in time I don't feel a personal attachment to it. The Gilded Age takes place at around 4 decades before my family immigrated to New York. They knew of many of the ""high-profile"" families mentioned in the show. It's so fun to watch history being made, while enjoying a really well written, acted, and costumed period drama. Even after all of these years loving Downton and the attention for detail, I think The Gilded Age has just stolen the #1 spot for my favorite period series. I hope it continues on for many seasons! Such a phenomenal cast, I'm eagerly anticipating every Monday!",10
"Vapid and Phony","Not much story and almost no authenticity. CGI city with lots of phony smoke is the background. The characters are more caricatures, a bunch of silly women huffing and puffing about their social status while the men are relegated to the background to make the money that gives the silly women their status.The heroine (Louisa Jacobson) is rather frumpy and too old for the ""babe in the woods"" role, while Christine Baranski acts like she's playing a warden in a women's prison movie. Cynthia Nixon continues to play Julie Harris (and not very well).The Black subplot isn't very interesting, and the money-making schemes of Russell (Morgan Spector) are so glossed over that they make no sense. The main social climber, Mrs. Russell (Carrie Coon), is unlikable although I suspect we're supposed to see her as a champion.Lots of Broadway stage people in this (out of work because of COVID): Audra McDonald, Kelli O'Hara, Donna Murphy, Nathan Lane, Katie Finneran, etc.Overall, the acting is flat and the enunciation is unbearably phony and crisp. Of course we all talked like that in the 1880s and no one had any kind of regional accent.",10
"Fantastic","The production design and costume design are enough of a reason to watch. Performances are strong across the board and the dialogue is perfection. I know this because I just watched the first episode unlike some people that leave comments before the episode even finished and labeled the show as ""woke"". I guess having mostly women in the lead cast and a black character makes this show super woke. I'm honestly surprised some commenters had the time to pause Transformers for two seconds to leave such insightful comments. I don't know who needs to hear this but if you don't like something, no one is forcing you to watch it. You are leaving comments just to be a troll.",10
"Please keep Guilded Age","There are not many shows that my husband and I watch together but The Guilded Age is one of them. We hope you get many more reviews to inspire another season. I'm not sure how true to life facts are included but the names of the characters and locations sound like they are. We get a glimpse into high society and the dirty little secrets that's so entertaining that we just want to see more! Great writing and actors! What shows will we have in common anymore? It was quite surprising to me that he would be interested in a night time storyline that has so much gossip and back stabbing that we hope you will consider bringing it back. Looking forward to season 3.",10
"Absolute masterpiece!","I absolutely love this series! The majesty and mastery of the intricate goings on at the time are eloquently portayed, Aunt Agnes is a triumph and although a harsh woman, shows a softer side when needed! I must also salute the costume department, never have I wanted to be able to have lived at the time more than this, the sumputous fabrics and gorgeous dresses!! BRAVO!! I have just finished S2 and well I couldn't have cheered more than in the last 5 minutes!! All the stories are so well interlinked and even the Household staff are great! Bannister being one of my favourites! I hope there will be a third series!",7
"Meryl Streep's spawn is ironically the worst actor in this series","You can say that ""The Gilded Age"" is a knock-off of the beloved ""Downton Abbey,"" effectively showcasing the beautiful sets and award-worthy costumes, however failing miserably to come up with compelling plot lines. The multiple subplots in ""The Gilded Age"" are razor thin and just try to get by from the sheer quantity. I keep hoping for some original plot development or even shocking twists but they never come. Besides the pretty art work and costumes to look at, the talented actors do keep me glued, especially the two sisters played by Cynthia Nixon and Christine Baranski. You have to love Baranski's cool snide delivery of those memorable one-liners. Cynthia Nixon is a revelation here as Aunt Ada. I have always found her to be rather annoying in her other work, but here she is my favorite, and I look forward to every scene that she is in. The other actors, from Carrie Coon as Bertha Russell to Blake Ritson as Oscar, deliver capably as expected. However, it needs to be called out that the main protagonist, the so-called glue to all characters and all storylines, is played by an actress who is clearly out of her league. The burden of carrying the show falls on her shoulders, and her inexperience and shortcomings are in full view. Louisa Jacobson exudes zero charm as Marion Brook. She fails to make this central character sympathetic which is critical to the quality of this show. For the first few episodes I start to question why she is selected as the main actress as I am perplexed. Then I find out that she is the daughter of none-other-than the great Meryl Streep, possibly the best actress of all time. There must be an assumption that due to genetic association, Louisa has to be just as good. But here is living proof that sometimes the apple can indeed fall far from the tree.",10
"Another Julian Fellowes Triumph","Here we see Julian Fellowes tell the story of late 19th century New York City high society, specifically the clash between the old money blue-bloods and the nouveau riche. As with all things Julian Fellowes does, the attention to historical detail - from clothing, to decor, to food, to mannerisms - is absolutely superb. The acting is fantastic, as most of the cast are Tony award-winning Broadway theater actors who found themselves available in early 2020 (when filming began) as a result of Covid shutting down the Broadway theaters.Some reviewers mention that The Gilded Age seems like a copy of Downton Abbey, likely not realizing that Julian Fellowes is the creator of both... and that both are part of the same transatlantic high-society story (although The Gilded Age begins in 1882 and Downton Abbey begins in 1912. Moreover, Julian Fellowes has hinted in an interview that he plans to introduce at some point a young Cora Levinson (later known as Cora Crawley/Lady Grantham), as it was known from Downton Abbey that Cora was known to both NYC and Newport society and was part of the less-accepted nouveau riche (thus the reason she was sent to London to find a husband).It's also interesting the references to the old 5th Avenue mansions. In fact, the Russell's mansion which is identified as being at 801 5th Avenue (at E. 61st) is actually the Bostwick Mansion (demolished in.1979, where now stands a 33-story luxury apartment building).",7
"Marian is a weak link","It's really unfortunate with this cast-some truly great actors here-that the central character of Marian, played by Louisa Jacobson, is so poorly cast. Her wooden delivery drags down every scene she's in--and her character is really central to the whole story. She should be the character we care most about. Big miss there. Otherwise, the costumes, acting, and sets are very good. This period drama is not going to dazzle you, but it's very solid, decent entertainment that's completely enjoyable-- except for Jacobson, who sadly made me cringe almost every time she delivered her lines (and I never forgot she was ""acting."" Ouch.)",2
"Horrible acting","Louisa Jacobson clearly got this role due to who her mom is. The acting is terrible except for Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon who are great along with a couple others but for the most part it's painful to watch but yet I keep watching to see if it gets any better. It's not.",9
"First Episode Enjoyable","I've waited a long time to see this show and I'm not disappointed, so far. Good characters played by good actors so I'm looking forward to seeing more.",8
"Stick with this until at least episode 6","It's rather slow and... 'wooden' in the beginning half of the series. Stick with it and you won't be disappointed!! The drama needs some time to ramp up. I'm not super keen on Louisa Jacobson's acting.. she's very stiff... But I try to look past it by thinking of the period they are in. The story lines are all interesting as time passes.",8
"Harmless Fun with a touch of historic interest","This is a well made light hearted show, the interesting part is the view of New York at that time, the money and opulence of the ruling class, it makes for a lighthearted change to the endless sex and violence.",10
"Outstanding","While I had been waiting for the premiere of this show once it started I took my time watching it. You know how it is. You want to watch something but don't feel like you're in the mood for it. But I finally hunkered down and watched the double length series premiere. When you watch it straight through it is phenomenal. The second episode even more so. You're still getting to know some of the players but you're loving the game. I dare someone to say they don't absolutely love George Russell by the end of episode two. I've watched that scene repeatedly. It's kind of awesome.Give the show a chance. It's enjoyable watching snobs get their comeuppance. It tickles me every time.",9
"A Story of Its Time and Place","This is a very specific story of the time in NY when new money families were encroaching on old money family's social circles. It did happen.Many of you are not interested in this story. Don't watch it. I'm interested in it.It was a more formal time. People did speak somewhat stiffly.I've been looking forward to this show for years, so I'm going to give it a chance.",10
"Incredible costumes! Great acting. Entertaining storylines.","I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!I cannot express how much I appreciate the commitment to quality in this show . . . The costumes, the sets, and so much more. The Gilded Age has also brought on some amazing talent to play fictional and non-fictional characters.So much centers on Bertha and George Russell. Strong, passionate, and committed to their family. This show also has some of the best characters that I love to hate.Julian Fellowes does it again . . . But, on this side of the Atlantic. I look forward to each and every episode. Then watch them again and again. I hope there will be more seasons to come.",6
"Lifeless and uncompelling","Unremarkable actors, shallow and unsympathetic characters, cloying music and a plodding plot... what's not to love? This feels like a half-assed attempt to make an American Downton Abbey. The costumes and sets are good but the core ingredients of something worth watching aren't there.",10
"Fantastic","""The Gilded Age"" is a captivating period drama that whisks viewers away to the opulence and societal complexities of late 19th-century New York City. Set against the backdrop of immense wealth and social upheaval, this series paints a vivid portrait of an era defined by industrialization, class divides, and the pursuit of power.The show brilliantly captures the extravagance and grandeur of the time, showcasing lavish costumes, stunning set designs, and the contrast between the glittering lives of the elite and the struggles of the working class. The attention to detail in recreating the period's nuances is commendable, immersing audiences in the ambiance of the Gilded Age.What truly shines in ""The Gilded Age"" is its intricate web of characters, each with their own ambitions, secrets, and desires. From the ambitious newcomers seeking societal acceptance to the established elite safeguarding their status, the ensemble cast delivers compelling performances that bring depth and complexity to their roles.",10
"Is overacting for the camera a thing now?","Okay, so I did think most of the people onscreen were badly miscast. But that being said, they are all talented folks. So why the major overacting from about half of them? Without mentioning names, so much excess facial ticking and looks and snorts and sighs that make absolutely no sense. Is it because too many of them have too much live theater in their blood? Just cool it. Cut it back by half. Just stand there and say your lines with intention, not ticks. Even if you don't move a muscle, the camera will get it all.",7
"Julian Fellowes fared much better in England","Everything about this series seems plastic and contrived. I adore Julian Fellowes, but his work is best done in England not in the United States, where American producers feel that overproduction makes everything better (it doesn't). The Gilded Age lacks all the charm, wit, and subtlety of Downton Abbey---the dialogue is too modern and PC, the CGI too obvious, the sets are too brightly lit (and look just like sets), the costumes are too immaculate, and many of the actresses have had a distracting amount of face-work (particularly Christine Baranski). Where's Dame Maggie Smith with her sagging jowls and her innate sense of superiority when you really need her? There's a Gay subplot that seems forced, and people of color are treated far more unrealistically than they were at the time. Overall, the series attempts to be historical while mirroring contemporary culture, making it both inaccurate and slightly ridiculous.",2
"Just as entertaining as Downton Abbey","Carrie Coon who plays Bertha Russell has stolen the show. Bertha and her husband want power and as much as they can get. The wealthy were the rock stars of the late 19th century and that still holds true today. We want to know all about them. My only complaint is that you have to spend a lot of money to see the second season, which is coming out every week episode by episode. All the characters are relatable and their motives are understandable in protecting their interests and loved ones. The background settling is breathtaking and the detail in writing is excellent. Relaxing entertainment, with a little more conflict than in Downton.",10
"Power-Greed-Class Distinctions-NYC Society","A good watch- great acting and a fascinating look of the ladies who lunch- only with ladies of similar old money over the top opulent aloof lifestyles. The husbands of these ""swans of 5th Ave"" are power mad-greedy deceitful bullies. Insightful and much of this prejudice and condescension of this world has not changed in today's world. It's still around-sadly. Good writing and well produced. A definite recommend.",10
"Watched episode 1: Perfectly casted","Cynthia Nixon in a new light. She's does splendid in this role! As a matter of opinion, I can't see anyone else playing any of the characters. Each character is perfectly casted. The storyline has me intrigued as I recall being taught that, when New York was coming up, there was a class war that had nothing to do with money nor what country your family descended from but, rather, everything to do with original natives of NY & new members moving into NY. The acting and storyline genuinely have me looking forward to seeing how the storylines play out.",10
"Absolutely Stunning","The costumes are beautiful, settings stunning and casting is superb...Cynthia Nixon, Christine Baranski and Louisa Jacobson are ver good... but my favorite is Denée Ayana Benton..This showis not for everyone...so if not your cup of tea...move on and let the rest of us watch it and enjoy it...",10
"Beautifully produced and acted, well written","The pilot episode introduces an assortment of richly-drawn characters and a fascinating setting. Certainly, there are echoes of Edith Wharton here, but so much the better. Christine Baransky and Cynthia Nixon are particularly good.There are some superficial similarities to Downton Abbey--a lady's maid who despises her mistress, for example--but that could not have been a rare circumstance in England or America.",10
"I'm happy clever writing isn't dead","It's just a quality show. It's not driven by ""the message"". It deals with issues in a tasteful manner.The dialogue is a treat. The music is great, the sets, all of it. It's what you would associate with the premium tv HBO has delivered time and time again.I see such a production and I just get so happy for the actors and everyone involved. It's still possible to create something worth watching in these politically charged times.Now back to the premium shows HBO has dished out. It's such a hard clash with the abomination that is their HBO max app. I'm literally having to watch this show in the browser on my laptop because the app on my phone either doesn't accept I have wifi connection (then I can only watch on my phone using my data) or if it once in a blue moon does find connection, I try and cast it to a Chromecast and it will only give me the option to watch it with descriptive audio. The normal audio track simply disappears when you cast.I just don't understand how HBO can let this app be in such a state. Such a stark contrast to the quality of their shows. I can pay for a sub but I'll have to torrent to watch anything. It's absurd.",8
"1st Episode was weak tea (or coffee).","A story of Old Money meeting New Money in New York circa 1880. So, episode 1 is ok but not great. I find the acting to be stiff and the dialog stilted, even for a ""period piece"". The dialog feels perfunctory, as if being merely read-off-a-page and comes across at the level of a Community Theater play. The casting is fine but the nouveau riche husband, Mr Russel, seems out of place. He is of another class, dark and swarthy, not your typical fat and fleshy wealthy White guy of the era, so he appears differently than the other wealthy Old Money men. Maybe this was deliberate? I'll give it another chance before hitting the kill switch.",6
"Downtown Abbey 2","The bar was set high with Downtown Abbey, so it's a difficult to make a better TV show, but this one comes close. It's very watchable, the opulence with architecture and costumes is even better now and there is much more intrigue which makes everything fun even though you feel like you've seen it before. Characters and their dynamics are very similar but the stakes are higher, so retrospectively Downtown Abbey almost looks relaxed even though it didn't feel like it back then. The long opening episode fulfills its purpose by drawing you in and introducing the characters in an entertaining way, I'd rate it 9/10, the remaining episodes are solid 8/10. The only thing I would have liked better is the story which could have surely been more suspensful with some good twists, now most things are predictable so I mostly kept watching because everything else is perfect including incredible performances from all the actors.",8
"Beautifully shot, but ultimately pointless","This review is based on the pilot episode.The camera work is great, as are the props, sets, costumes and editing.I was not at all convinced by casting. Louisa Jacobson (lead female), Morgan Spector (railway tycoon with the palace), Carrie Coon (his socially ambitious wife) and Cynthia Nixon (one of the aunts) felt completely unconvincing to me. They were not helped by improbable dialogues, cliches and lazy writing (""when you make an omelette, you have to break a few eggs"").Denee Bendon (ambitious young black lady) and Christine Baranski (the matriarch aunt), seemed okay in their roles.I found it difficult to care about any of the characters. I will try one more episode, but I think it is unlikely that I will continue watching. Created by Fellowes (Downton Abbey, which I haven't watched), it feels like a rushed and ultimately pointless version set in the new world, basically a ""Gilded Age"" porn.If you want to get your fix of the upper class old time New York, just rewatch The Age of Innocence (1993), which has everything that this series doesn't, perfect casting, acting, costumes, dialogues, story, tension, love, passion, and is a masterpiece. That film is art, this series is a wannabe Downton cousin, but feels like a ""watch-this-because-there-is-nothing-else-on-TV"" fodder.",6
"A brave attempt","Following the success of Downton Abbey, there were hopes for this show, but the grace and awe of country castle do not transfer to the US in this show. The first episode sets the tone and context for the story and characters, but the gaps weaknesses in this show are too obvious. The use of green screen to create old golden age rooms is too obvious and the result is something akin to a Star Trek video game from the 1990s; I am guessing sets and locations could not be provided. The digital house staff just look awful.The pacing is pushed, the dialogue shallow, and the setting dull. Old money versus new money does make a story, it just looks like a Dallas remake. The actors either needed more time to get to know their characters or to go back to their drama classes.I hate to write bad reviews, but this show needs a lot of help, which is surprising for a show on HBO.Roo.s rooms.",4
"Love it","One of the best shows I have seen in a long time. As the characters are developing the show becomes more interesting. There have been so many stinkers these past 2 years....it's nice to see something different.",10
"Delicious first episode","If there's one thing the world needs more of, it's TV by Julian Fellowes. The Gilded Age has its own distinctive style, but it certainly has the Fellowes trademarks - a large and charming group of actors, a beautiful historical back drop, and differing castes interacting in fascinating ways. It feels fresh yet familiar, and I easily became interested in the struggles of these characters after only one episode. Yes, it's somewhat subtle, and I don't doubt that it will go over the heads of a certain subset of viewers. I will definitely be watching this season, I'm looking forward to more already.",8
"What a stunning series ...","What a stunning series that has gained significant momentum in the second season, not only in terms of the cast, the characters and the dialogues but also in terms of the acting, which inspires again in every episode. This is exactly right and important in 2023 in order to convey to a society that a transformation from above with gender politics and climate madness as well as wars against people all over the world for profit is not progress but a massive step backwards. What is artificial intelligence worth compared to kindness and understanding? Why should we subordinate our lives to digital hype and no longer be allowed to experience meaning? Are just a few questions that this work raises and shows, in particular to a generation whose brains have been washed by social media, that differences are important in order to recognize this world in which we all live. The morality that is being flaunted today is nothing more than a hollow claim to power and this series is a reassurance that times will soon be guided by real values again, which are characterized by performance instead of arbitrary tolerance and that we will be able to live more freely again without to be driven into digital totalitarianism by the globalists. I wish everyone had more ideas to develop than in science fiction, whose future was already in the 1960s. The world needs less Star Wars and more peace, progress and decentralization.",10
"Defeat is not your color","This first episode is beautiful. You are engulfed in the old world of New York. Watching the old rich and the new rich in a game of chess. You learn very fast how the game should be played.",8
"Bridgerton Who?","I e been looking forward this show and the odd person say ""it's stiff"" ""or ""wooden""... yes, that's how people back then acted. Yes I will be watching!!!! Such a fantastic cast!!!!",10
"WONDERFUL!!!!!","I know that there have only been three episodes so far, but each one continues to be better than the last. The story is delving deeper and I am enjoying each and every minute! The history, the society, the glamour, the gorgeous settings and costumes are, without a doubt, BREATHTAKING. The stories are multi- layered and we are just beginning to peel back the onion. I love the name dropping, the history of it all, the society etiquettes, and everything about this show. Yes, there are many throwbacks to Downton Abbey, but The Gilded Age seems more mature. I am so enjoying Mrs. Russell and her wrath. I love the polite, yet undercutting dialogue. I love the scenery. I love the sets. I love the costumes. And, so far, I love the entire production! I cannot wait to see where this all goes!! I highly recommend The Gilded Age-It's fabulous!",10
"Needs Improvement","This is very formulaic Julian Fellowes. He's very good at creating unique characters, putting them in unique circumstances then giving them little victories over time in order to keep the audience feeling good. This series is very different from Downton in that many of the lead characters are unlikeable. Christine Baranski's character is not only unlikeable but also unbelievable. It's just too much to ask viewers to believe that this rich, old white woman with old money who equates wealthy people with new money to thieves and murderers would be so sympathetic and welcoming to a stranger who is also a black woman. The ""downstairs"" people are all creepy and some are stalkers. The only decent people are the rich people who've been shunned by proper society for simply being human beings with a history of making very human mistakes. As enjoyable the costumes and scenery might be, ultimately the tepid plot lines and cold, dislikable leads outweigh the pretty pictures and make this series a bit of a miss.",7
"Great characters","I hovered between giving this series an 8 or a 9 and the strong character work pushed me toward the latter! I found myself immersed in the form of each character. All put together exceedingly well with varied style and personality. Aunt Agnes brings a sarcastic humor which I found more then enjoyable. The story line is well written and interesting, especially the world of the Russels and that of the lead Miss Marion Brook. I find similarities to Downton Abbey but with the 1800s new world feel, I am a huge outlander fan and this certainly helped to fill the void. Absolutely worth a watch if you were born in the wrong time like me and take any chance to runaway with a good period drama. Very much looking forward to season 2!",9
"Stilted dialogue and two dimensional","I've only watched 20 minutes but a story is supposed to grab you by then. Granted, this is not a feature film but even so, the dialogue is so pedestrian and unsurprising. I'll watch the first episode because I'm a Downton Abbey fan but so far it's Zzzzzz.",6
"Disappointing","I'm afraid I wasn't very impressed with this show. The sets are opulent, the costuming is above average, but that's all there is - it's as if they put all their efforts into creating some great visuals, but forgot all the important things. The story is simplistic, the dialog is stilted and contrived, and the acting is lackluster. I am assuming the real fault lies with a bad script and poor direction because that many actors can't all be this bad - it has to be that they have very little to work with.",3
"A very refreshing show.","This is a tv series well worth watching. It contains a sophisticated glance at the history of New York, America, and American aristocracy in 19th century. Many movies and series have focused on wild and untamed American west. This show depicts the well tamed, cultured, and civilized American east of the same time period. How the newly rich were not accepted by the established higher class of New York. It is interesting and captivates the attention of the viewers. One may say it is Dynasty set in 1880s.",9
"Downtown in New York","Watch the first episode...loved it downtown abbey transplanted in New York Opulence great script ,,,good acting and wonderful costumes.. if you were a Dan of ...abbey You will find a lots a lookalike but that did not bother me Louise Jacobsen is wonderful ..great presence and lovely to look at Christine baranski will grow on you on the first episode very quiet and subdued..Carrie coon is the one for me that will be the juicy one...fellows is a great script writer and his knowledge of class is great..they could have done without the gay son too similar to the butler in abbey...let,s wait for another episode ...but I am hooked on the first one....",9
"Eh I love it","Okay so maybe it's trying to be like downton Abbey. But like who cares? I love it. Love the drama love the costumes and sets. Love it all. Acting is kinda wooden but that's not the actors faults that's the writing. These are actors known for their talent. This show is great and I love it.",10
"1970s Mini-Series?","What a complete disaster. Poor casting choices. Poor set lighting. Poor set design. This feels like I'm watching a mini-series from the 1970s, production quality is awful. This should never be compared or associated with Downton Abbey.",8
"Worth watching!! Love this genre","It's No Downtown Abbey but it's worth watching. Especially bc I couldn't find another series similar to Downtown Abbey.Don't want to give any spoilers but I was glad to see the uppity class get a kick in the butt by beating them at their own game!!I love the innocence of this genre and Glad to see this genre stick around.Tv is getting out of hand. Now u have to look at a show b4 allowing the kids to watch a particular show.: (I hope this show is here to stay!",9
"Amazing","Stop saying it's like Downton Abbey! Of course same person wrote both shows but they are nothing alike. Absolutely love this show I cannot wait each week for a new episode and I am already sad that it's only nine episodes the first season and I have to wait another year for season two. A 10 out of 10 in every possible way!",10
"DOWNTON ABBEY it is not.","The series - have watched 7 episodes - is not near to the excellence of Downton Abbey, much as I'd hoped it would be. Baranski, Nixon, Benton, McDonald, Lane deliver good performances but there's a superficiality to the entire story line that drowns them out. Unlike in Downton, there lacks an underpinning substantial enough to become invested in what happens to the characters. The gross imposition of modern day political correctness voids any sense of historical accuracy. The blatant bedroom scenes of the two guys, the forced equality of the sexes around the servants' kitchen table, and even the black to white population ratio at the lighting of the building in episode 7 all are very unrealistic, historically. The presentation of all that goes on in the servants' area is too pristine for the time; didn't the servants ever do actual work of any kind? Oh well.",6
"I have watched for two seasons","And the season has gotten even better. I will not divulge much about the gilded age season two or season one just in case anybody hasn't watched it and is going to watch it but let's just say I can't wait for many more of the gilded age to come this show has been the brightest of HBO yet to come, especially for this time. I love shows that captivate this time. So much and I wish that there were more like this show has the light on what the gilded age of New York was once and I cannot wait to see more of it and hopefully they'll be many more seasons to come. And to see what in store for the gilded age.",10
"Rushed dialogue","This looks promising with cast & sets & wardrobe but I certainly hope the actress playing Mrs. Russell (Carrie Coons) settles into her role, slows down with her dialogue and adds better diction.She may very well be nervous.Every other actor seems suited for his/her part.Excited to see how this series unfolds.",7
"Lavish, and talent galore! But... the writing...ugh","OMG! Baranski! Nixon! Coons! MacDonald! This series drips with an embarrassment of talent, but the writing comes off as unnatural, and forced for rapid story movement. It seems to be trying too hard to capture the unique qualities of Downton Abby, but it's no longer new and intriguing the way Downton was.But Baranski gives Maggie Smith a good run with her witty, biting insight and lines; excellent delivery. I have been watching Cynthia Nixon since I was 12...this role is an excellent addition to her vast repertoire. Cute, funny, sublime, wise and vulnerable.Sometimes the secondary cast (and Carrie Coons) come off stiff as a board and far over-invested in the delivery of an over-rated line or some poorly timed nuance. It's distracting and needs attention.",5
"Disappointing","I was so looking forward to watching this, but was profoundly disappointed. The cast seems to lack any chemistry, the dialogue felt awkward and stilted. It felt like the whole show was trying very, very hard to be Downton Abbey but it is not. And that should be ok. I felt Christine Baranski was really being held back for some reason though Cynthia Nixon was a nice surprise. I normally don't like her. At all. This show does have promise however and I will watch again with fingers crossed.",10
"Gilded Age is Gold","I've been patiently waiting for this, and so far, I want more! For the people reading about the others who are moaning about this or that, after one episode, don't let them influence your decision to watch.Also, I have to plug Another Period, if you want a comedy from that era and enjoy Drunk History, I recommend it.",10
"Brilliant show!","This ticks all the boxes for those who love a corset!! What a great idea to showcase the changes in Fifth Avenue New York with the old vs the new money.Similar to Bridgerton, it places a different spin on the era. Even though it sticks to the traditions in terms of music, there is an air of modern that flows through the show. Assuming the information is accurate, it was very interesting to see the birth of The Metropolitan. Gives New York a whole new perspective for those of us who did not have a lot of knowledge previously.Excellent cast and the costumes are to die for! Cannot wait for S3!!!",10
"Love it!","New money old money.... The Glided Age/Victorian Age was a turning point in financial classification. The show alone (and, I'm only on the first episode) is a must see. It also, has a strong character towards women wanting to progress and be an equal in a society that was during a time where the male had the say in everything.",10
"Wish I could be a part of all this splendor","Costumes & sets are Magnifique!!!!I love every character. I love the little adventures they get themselves into.At first I was annoyed by the fact that their biggest concern were parties and dinners and balls and who would wear what and who would be invited at wich party and who would ditch a certain soiré. I kept thinking the world is such a horrible place for soooo many people, but now I really loooooove the fact that it't all rose scent and moonshine. No real problems and if there are any, they quickly get solved and everybody can get back to attending/hosting more lavish parties, wearing stunning dresses, sceaming to arrange the biggest event. I really love that it's funny and light and i would sell my soul to see the next season!!!!!",10
"Very good","The Gilded Age is extremely well written and acted. The sets and costumes are absolutely top notch. The storylines really draw you in and keep you there through the whole thing. I liked Downton Abbey, which this is in the same vein of, but this is better in some ways, and really holds it's own very well. The only aspect that kind of bugged me was the nonstop racist rants of a small group of regular characters. We get it - they don't like people who don't look like them, and only trust people who look like them. I think we got that message after the first 10 or 15 times. No need to keep repeating it. Otherwise, though, an excellent series, and I can't wait for season 3.",8
"No Downtown Abbey but..........watchable","Any period drama succeeding Downtown Abbey will find itself in the rather unfortunate position of being compared to it, a position we can all agree, is quite difficult because Downtown Abbey is the hallmark of period dramas. Neverthelesss, I find this show to be rather entertaining although some of the acting doesn't quite hit the mark. What may also be challenging is the fact that this is an American period drama and people equate period dramas with the Brits and I for one couldn't always distinguish who was American but speaking the Queens English and who was actually supposed to be English.",7
"Thank you for the tassels plethora, OMG!","Love it. It is soap opera with lofty aspirations. Sharp dialogues, characters we want to kill or embrace, and OMG the costumes! OMG, the dresses, the tassels, the hats, the mansions!!! I bet the actors had fun doing it (except maybe when it comes to fitting into the extreme corsets. Trim waistlines galore!) Me, I have great fun watching and even my husband drinks the show like sweet milk. We actually never miss the opening credits at the beginning of each episode: the CGI visuals unfolding in that lush 1 minute sequence are enchanting. Julian Fellowes: fine job getting the money to film this plethora, and great job on the script. We love it.Viewer, is the show is worth your time? Watch the show, enjoy the bonbons and go to bed dreaming. Total guilty pleasure.",8
"Poor casting","Maybe fans of Downton Abbey should not watch this. Unlike Downton, the casting seems off, the actors out of place, and the writing is weak. The actors seem like they're having a difficult time reading lines, and delivering them in a stilted way much like someone reading off a cue card. I realize the writing has much to do with that, along with the proper period grammar, but it's still stiff and unfeeling. I will give it a few episodes and hope it gets better. Poor casting is the second issue, I thought Cynthia Nixon would be out of place but she's actually quite good. Christine Baransky is terrible, and I love her in most anything. I'm just really disappointed because I loved Downton, so I was hoping for another great show.",6
"Nope...","Maybe I'm alone in thinking I've had quite enough of Julian Fellowes's take on history. Mannered snappy dialogue, askew glances, 21st century good looks and tedious, predictable storylines that are both anachronistic and trashy.I'll stick my neck out here... life just wasn't like this! A steady procession of perfect teeth, beautifully made up, sexy, microbially clean models gliding from one scene to another is just so unreal. Where is the time it takes to get from one place to another? The dirt, zits, diseases and disasters that befell all of society in that era. A common cold was dangerous, a broken limb catastrophic. Yet this is all intrigue, all dialogue, all sassy nonsense.I love history. I work in a living museum. We strive day in, day out to get it right. This stuff is just TV candy for the intellectually challenged. You like fluff? Watch this, you'll love it. Just like 'Bridgerton' and a hundred other so-called historical dramas that bear no resemblance to historical fact, this series is simply lame. Downton Abbey was better, and made for me by Maggie Smith and others, yet Mr Fellowes has always made me feel somewhat cold towards this kind of entertainment. It's too clean, too gentile, too modern, too clean (oh, I think I already said that) and too inconsequential.Thomas hardy wrote real characters. Charles Dickens revealed Victorian society in its entirety, warts and all. Edgar Poe gave us malice and dirt and vengeance on an epic scale, and with some of the greatest writing in the English language. This stuff is... not.",3
"George Seurat's 'Sunday in the Park with George'","Wonderful acting. Amazing costumes. It's a new revelation from Julian Fellowes. I am enthralled, and I'm not easily enthralled.Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon are over-the-top and their experience is on display.Mrs Russell, Carrie Coon, is even better here than her role as Ben Afleck's twin sister in Gone Girl. Scene stealer.And then there's Morgan Spector.The costume design is so beautiful & perfectly depicts the era.",10
"GREAT CASTS","Usually it's hard for me to like period drama but this time I already loved the pilot episode and really gives me Downton Abbey vibe. Cannot wait to see where this series is going, especially with Carrie Coons character.",10
"A breath of Fresh Air!","Upon watching the first episode. I was pleasantly taking back by the simple yet delightful story line. All of the Character actors are devine in their own way. This is a gracious nod to how status ""old vs. New money"" was perceived during such time. So far it depict the era very delicately, and precisely in the very way it truly was. It's truly the prequel to Downton Abby, and leads me wanting more, having all the pomp and circumstances that follows. I'm begging, and pleading; In a world full of (unrealistic, Reality TV, and Desperate Housewives of whatever county), ""PLEASE GIVE THIS SHOW A CHANCE!""
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I'm hooked, and I like it!",10
"Period drama piece the way it should be.","I just finished watching episode 3 and I must honestly say that it comes as no surprise that it is exactly what a period drama piece should be. The storyline portrays the historical period in which it is set, with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The sets and costumes are true to the age that the drama is set in. It is obvious that a great deal of attention to detail went into not only the costumes and set, but also the lifestyle, manners, mannerisms, language and interactions of people from various stations and backgrounds, during the period. (Non of that painful and cringeworthy fake period drama wokeness with fake period music, and rewriting of history as portrayed in Bridgerton. Take note Shonda Rhimes, this is period drama the way it should be.)The series has a good mix of actors with various skill sets including notable cast members such as Christine Baranski (Agnes van Rhijn), Cynthia Nixon (Ada Brook) and Jack Gilpin (Church, the Russell family's butler).Being a product of Julian Fellowes, known for other immensely entertaining period dramas such as Downton Abbey, Belgravia and The English Game, The Gilded Age will no doubt live up to a high standard.",8
"Great Storyline","The first two episodes have been released, at the time of this review. The characters and the storyline are being set up beautifully and thoroughly. I am impressed with the detail which has been taken, ranging from character development, storyline, and even the sets. Every detail has been meticulously thought through, which I appreciate in a new series. I would take the depth they have given the viewer over the shock-and-awe most new series use. This should develop into a wonderful series and I'm already gripped!",10
"Witty & Refreshing - Spoiler Alert","I'm not sure why people seem to be so conflicted with the reviews here...Doesn't have the same depth as Downton Abbey yet but the scope of players is much larger so I feel like that may be inhibiting the character development at the moment. I'm curious to see how the characters develop further into the season.The language of the time was definitely different from the verbiage of the script, that being said I assume they're trying to capture multiple age groups as watchers. If the script was too accurate I feel it would lose younger audiences. The script, nonetheless, is witty & keeps a good pace. It moves quickly & if you're not paying attention important facts will be missed.I like the cast, for the most part. I feel the actors may develop their characters more as the show progresses.*spoiler alert* The cook stealing could completely be left out of the story so far. We get no background on this, no time to be conflicted about our feelings for the cook, or about her internal conflict regarding her choice of actions past & present. This adds nothing to our storyline & serves as a preconceived prejudice regarding immigrant workers.Costumes are pretty impressive. Design is adequate, not mind blowing though.Will update more as I'm only 3 episodes in.",8
"Mediocre at best","I've read many of the reviews and agree with most. This is not Julian Fellows at his best. The Baranski character is as annoying as she has been in most everything she's done. I find my attention span drifting while trying to follow the soap opera plot. I don't believe any of the critics have mentioned the dull and lifeless musical score.We will watch it to the end - but only because there's little else worthwhile.",6
"amazing show","Everything about this show is amazing! From cinematography to dialogues to acting to pretty much everything! Now am not American nor versed in American history to point out the errors and whatever, am just here to watch a good show and I can understand if someone has issues with the historical facts but it's a show! It can't be perfect.... one thing I disliked tho was obviously the ending of episode 1, be unique America! We get it, but I just wish it wasn't there, it's a generic and boring plot! No one wants to watch another forbidden love storyline...",10
"The Gilded Age","If you accept that this is not based on historical accuracy and lean into the pomp and rich etiquette of the times you will not be disappointed. It is not Downtown Abbey nor does it pretend to be.",7
"Big disappointment","Is this really from Julian Fellows? Inane dialog read by wooden actors and poor production values. It looks like they spent all their money on sets and costumes and to make up for it they skipped rehearsals and tried to do every scene in one take.I have seen better acting in high school productions.",2
"Worth the wait","I enjoyed the first episode. The characters and the sets were beautiful. My biggest gripe is when the two men started having sex. Didn't need it, don't want to see it. It could have been tastefully implied... but don't make us watch it.",10
"Good First Episode...But Still No Downton Abbey!","The first episode was quite good!! Great actors! Beautiful costumes! Opulence and decadence of the Belle Epoque period can clearly be seen. However it made me feel like I'm watching a play about the socialite elites of New York. The actors and actresses did quite well specially Cynthia Nixon and Christine Baranski. The plot may be quite predictive. As a great fan of Downton Abbey, this may take its place for the meantime.",8
"HBO soap opera","I was expecting a little more from HBO, it's more like a Mexican soap opera with lots of cheese drama plots and scandals. I'm still watching it cuz i'm cheap like that. Lol.",8
"Wow!","Well, Julian Fellowes did it again. Good job!Interesting story, good actors, inteligent dialogues. Scenes, costumes...everything!I really enjoy in show. Bravo!",10
"Refreshing","A little slow but refreshingly so. Julian Fellows brings Downton Abbey to America. So tired of shows with all the porn, language, drugs and killing. I will watch as long as it's on. Thank you Julian!",9
"Gorgeous costumes and scenery","Filmed in gorgeous old houses in Rhode Island, pure Julian escapism but this time set in the United States. Episode 1 sucks you in, looking forward to the rest of the episodes.",10
"New money, old rules","I've always been drawn to shows filmed in the Victorian era and I don't know really why so I can never figure out what to say but I'll try to explain why I like this one specifically. Only that it wasn't the Victorian times as it was set in America hence the name, The Gilded Age. Firstly was the cast, I absolutely loved Carrie Coon in ""The Leftovers"" and in turn I'm now inclined to watch her other shows and movies so when I heard she'd be one of the leading roles in this I was excited to check it out. Her and George Russell's (Morgan specter) marriage is an interesting dynamic here and it's one of the show's highlights for me, they're both quite witty and ruthless in pursuit of their ambitions but George tends to think of his family more while Bertha is so narrowly focused on fitting into society.There are a lot of stories taking place here, mostly whispers about who's seeing who and other stories about who's who which is common for many series set at the time and in polite society. There's so many stories but it's easy to keep up with all of them and the gossip. The outstanding theme is about old money versus new money though and that affects pretty much most of everything else that goes on. It's also quite aesthetic, either the wardrobe or the scenery catches the eye. There's also quite a lot of witty dialogue, noticeably from Aunt Agnes and Mr Russell, and it doesn't feel forced for the sake of quotability, it just goes along with the characters. Only criticism I see often is ""oh, it's still not downtown Abby"" but I think that's not reason enough to stay away from watching it. It seems pretty well thought out with intentions for future seasons and season one is great groundwork. Doesn't feel like those shows that are ended abruptly or on cliff hangers just to inspire renewing it for a new season. And for that I'm optimistic for the future of the show.",7
"Enjoyable stories and good acting","I don't understand some of the terrible reviews. The show is really interesting and the actors quite good. The Russells are superb its wonderful to see such a united couple with a solid loving marriage. George is my favorite character. He is not 100% villain he is dynamic and balanced. I also like Peggy's storyline. So great to see the parallel lifestyle of some African Americans at that time period. Especially displaying their intelligence, hard work and success. And I love Cynthia Nixon in the Ada role. Lastly the amazing sets and costumes are glorious. A great escape for Monday nights! Well done!",10
"Got better in the second season","The first season was OK but lacked a compelling central conflict. You can't expect the foibles of the ultra rich to be relatable but if there's interesting stakes involved it can still be entertaining. The first season's new money vs. Old money thing was ultimately all about who would get invited to which parties - not all that interesting. The second season was about the creation of the Metropolitan, a famous cultural center in New York City.The first season also suffered from too much focus on Marian who, sorry to say, is probably the weakest actor in the cast. The second season wisely opened up the storytelling to a more ensemble style. Multiple characters get their due. Any scene with Christine Baranski or Nathan Lane is guaranteed to sparkle.Where the show still needs some work is the ""downstairs"" stories. They're just OK and so far none of the characters have really resonated with the exception of Turner who only got interesting when her position changed. And it's quite obvious that Julian Fellows is really out of his comfort zone when he writes black people. 'nuff said.All in all the show is a good fun that I'm sure it takes a lot of liberties with the actual events of the time but if I wanted a documentary, I'd watch that.",7
"Nothing Original Here","Talk about trying too hard. The whole first episode was like the hustle & bustle scene boarding the ship in Titanic. Grand, flourishing music. Very specifically placed background actors. Everything building the excitement. For. Every. New. Scene. I know Julian Fellowes can't expect lightning to strike twice, but come on. I'm exhausted from all the hype. And no substance to be seen. I'll give the next episode or two a chance, but if these characters don't get interesting fast, I'll just re-watch Downton Abbey.",4
"A Joy to Watch","I've now watched two episodes of The Guilded Age and found myself thoroughly entertained by the storylines, interested in the characters and impressed with the production quality. So far, it's a joy to watch !",10
"Not Particularly Sharp, but Fun!","Though it occasionally dripped of saccharine sweetness and often brimmed with overt optimism, I highly enjoyed the series premiere! It did indeed lack the sharpness and intelligence of Downton or Belgravia, and the acting was a little hammy. But overall, I found it to be a delightful romp through Edith Wharton's New York (though seen through rose colored glasses) and a lovely escape for those dreary Monday blues. I hope that after the initial first episode setup, we'll see the writing, acting, and story improve.",8
"Show excellent, casting not so much","I am a huge Julian Fellowes fan. The man is absolutely brilliant and I will watch anything that his name is attached to. I've admired Downton Abbey, Doctor Thorne and Belgravia to name a few. Why did it take me so long to watch Gilded Age? When I first saw it advertised, I was so excited. Then I saw one of my least favorite actresses attached to it, Christine Baranski. Yes, I didn't watch it initially because I don't care for her. I never liked anything she has been in. That aside, I gave in for my love of Julian Fellowes and so glad I did. The show is brilliant. It reminds me of Downton Abbey, where they show the lives of the inhabitants upstairs as well as downstairs and how their lives can cross over.This show is quite different from Downton Abbey though. It takes place in the greatest city in the world, NYC and it's mostly about social climbing and the conflict of old money versus new money.Casting was a miss for me though. Most actors suited their roles but one glaringly obvious miscast was the part of Marian. I tried to like her, being a main character, but I couldn't. She is very wooden, and monotone, everything she says comes off dry. She had a line where she was surprised to see Peggy and she said it with zero inflection in her voice. I found myself being annoyed every time she came on screen. Something about her was nagging at me, I couldn't place it so I Googled her name and when I saw who her mother is, it all made sense. I can't help think she got the part because of her mother. She looks completely out of place for her character and not very good at acting. And I was right about Christine Baranski, her acting is not good and her presence unlikable. I would love to ask casting why they cast these two. I could see if they had minor parts but they are two major characters.Some shining performances for me were Cynthia Nixon, who I was never a fan of, played the part of Aunt Ada and did a brilliant job playing her. The likeable Harry Richardson was a plus for me. I loved him in Poldark and Doctor Thorne. I enjoyed the story-line and performances by Taylor Richardson and Ben Ahlers (Bridget and Jack). I'm hoping to see more of them in Season 2. Amy Forsyth as Carrie Astor, for example, is well cast. Her face steals every scene she's in, she looks right for the role, she an incredible actress, very well cast and beautiful performance.I absolutely love the interaction between Church and Bannister. They are the two butlers that live across the street from each other. The ending of Season 1, episode 9 when they see each other from across the street and nod to each other made me smile. Absolutely brilliant.",8
"Loved it!","Really enjoyed this - beautiful production, music ,costumes providing an insight into American history- great cast - look forward to season 2! Nice to see Nathan Lane Carrie Coon superb!",8
"What happened to this show?","I enjoyed the series until this season when everything fell flat...like a badly written soap opera.I don't know how to describe my disappointment without a spoiler-filled rehash of everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. I can't think of one plot point that wasn't overdone, cringey or too ludicrous for words...except a couple involving only the servants.The clock patent and possible romance between the 2 van Rijn and Russell servants was interesting. Plus, I got a kick out of Agnes' butler putting her in her place.Maybe next season will redeem itself, but, given all the ludicrous plot points needing resolution, I doubt it. They've already been telegraphed. The only possible surprise will be who Oscar van Rijn's next beard wil be.I gave this season's costumes the 3 stars. The writing and directing was just abysmal.",9
"Loving this so far","I really want new money to stomp all over old money and put them in their place.Let's just say I have been sucked into a number of historical dramas that aren't my usual following. I am a horror/sci fi junkie at heart. But a person cannot live on Korean offerings alone, because that seems to be all that is available.So give this a go. HBO is delving into this, and if we don't support it, like so many other things, it will die on the vine with only 1 season. Don't let that happen.",10
"Brilliant after a little patience","I'm a huge Downton fan and initially struggled to get into this. On first attempt I found it style over substance but I gave it a second chance and I'm glad I did because I really loved it.Easily the stand out characters are Ada and Agnes who give a real Downton quality to the whole thing. It's a fascinating period in history and good to see an American side as often we associate these kinds of characters with us Brits.The ending to series two is just begging to be continued so I hope we see another series. The 1930s would interesting too if a sequel is ever on the cards. I'd also love to meet Ada and Agnes as very old women. Did somebody say Maggie Smith?",6
"Old Money vs. New Money, who cares?","At least with Downton, the premise of the show was the loss of an estate, the loss of an age. And the characters were rich and we fell in love with them from the very first moment.This is a premise I could care less about. Two women fighting over social position.There are two glimmers of hope. Meryl Streep's daughter, who's never acted before, was lovely, although they should have let her have her natural hair color, which is gorgeous. Hair coloring in the 1880s bothers me regardless. She gave a performance that shocked me and I'd no idea she was new to the business until I looked her up. Cynthia Nixon also shocked me. I've never been a huge fan, but she really pulled off the ""nice"" aunt, proving to me that she's a fine actor. And while I didn't see much from Christine Baranski, I know she's one of the best actresses working today and if there's a problem it's not with her.The second glimmer of hope is with the servant staff. Julian Fellows obviously can write them well and we were all much more in love with the servants then the nobility in Downton, so there's no surprise there. But things will have to get more spicy in the near future or else this glimmer will fade. And of course, this being America, we have to include a racial story line. Unlike the example shown to us so excellently by the makers of Bridgerton, we have to have this because it is set in America and we simply must show racism. But, Denee Benton's performance was on the mark, it was compelling and her character is interesting and shrouded in some intrigue. So I am hopeful.In the end though, if the premise remains, old money vs new, and two old ladies fighting over social standing of rich people, aka nothing, then I fear this show will fail. But if it becomes about rich characters in stead of rich old ladies warring, then I think it's got a chance. Julian Fellows always has a chance, and a pretty good one at that.",10
"Absolutely Stunning","I am not one to take the time to write a review but I want more!! I am eager to see season 3!!! I watched both season 1 and 2!! I am ecstatic! It just gets better and better. Great Character development. I literally can not wait to see the 3rd season. I've started rewatching seasons 1 and 2. It's playing as I write this. I see some reviews were people cast judgments far too soon. It goes to deeper depths of how people of different class and race are treated. There is good in our world no matter what era. Continue to watch! You will not regret. Well written, great actors and actresses.. eye catching attire.",7
"Gilded","Excellent storyline and writing. (Classic Julian Fellowes) Scenery is marvelous. The drama is an easy watch with delightful historical scripting, playful exchange between characters, the dynamic of race and the struggle to normalize that existed in the 1880's, the struggle between labor and the powerful financial class, the wrangling between the powerful financial classes (the old money vs the new). My one knock is the casting of Bertha Russell. I think someone other than Carrie Coon should have chosen for the role. Laura Linney? Kelly Curran might have been a better choice. Quite distracting when a series that could be a classic misses on a key casting.",1
"anachronistic nonsense with no historical or dramatic value","Anachronism is the perfect definition for this cr4444p called the gildead ageThe writing is ananachronistic you can see what kind of message they send from the beginningthe anachronistic writing that tries to get its modern message across is simply awful, pretentious and irritating.Tacky show, the performances are worthy of a children's theater, the plot is recycled and not well structured, shallow characters, crude plot, Mexican soap opera, generic and extremely clear direction of photographyjust a show that has no value in being historical or in being dramatic entertainment.",9
"Nearly perfect.","The show is set during the era of the so-called 'rober barons'...incredibly wealthy men who made huge fortunes no matter what the cost to their poor employees. But the program doesn't center very much on these poor but the rich, their friends as well as their servants. The vibe is very much like ""Downton Abbey"" and it's written by the same man. Overall, a very satisfying and beautiful program which will likely have you longing to see more.I really loved watching both seasons (up to now season three has not yet been released) and was ready to give the show a 10. But it is, at times, a bit predictable...but also incredibly unpredictable (such as the finale of season two). The predictability are many of the romantic relationships (particularly of the lead)...but considering how rich the characters are, I'll cut this some slack.",10
"Love the twist on upstairs / downstairs and old / new money","I'm super enjoying this light hearted period drama! I want to know the characters more and the episodes pulled me along. The costumes are art in themselves. Stunning gown, suits, hats, sets, flowers!The storylines are quaint yet intriguing. Absolutely I want to see how Julian has woven contemporary women in the (now) awkwardness of outmoded 19th century thinking.I'm thrilled that writers can be confident to make 21st century storylines about 19th century society. So much fun and beauty to watch.Lighten up naysayers and just enjoy the beauty and stories. I don't see the pov of 1 and 2 star rating. Perhaps they expected the death and horror and anguish of, say, Yellowstone.",7
"Stop expecting to watch Downton Abbey when this is a completely different place and era","I'm not sure why everyone is expecting to watch the same show they already have. This show is set is a completely different continent and taking place 40 YEARS before the British series. Of course it's going to be different. I agree some of the actors in this series have not yet found their rhythm but overall this is a great production. I love this show though and am hoping that it gets picked up for at least another couple of seasons, because let's get real that's often when series shine. If you are having trouble understanding the series I would suggest you read up some on New York and the US in the 1800s. Remember, it was still a frontier country, a vast contrast to Western Europe in the early 20th century.",9
"Baron Kitchener-Fellowes of West Stafford Does It Again","I'm curious about the love it or hate it nature of the reviews for Lord Fellowes' latest historical drama. Are reviews for The Gilded Age better or worse depending on the viewer's familiarity or ignorance of the historical context? I was a little unsure after the first episode, but now that I'm a full three episodes in I've become as obssessed with this Julian Fellowes series as I was after just the FIRST episode of Downton Abbey.The Reconstruction Era, which preceded The Gilded Age, ended with what is still probably the most despicable and corrupt political bargain in American history, the Compromise of 1877, in which the Republican loser of the popular vote was ""allowed"" to assume the Presidency in exchange for what amounted to the repeal of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and the revocation of ALL Civil Rights for former African-American slaves across all of the States of the former Confederacy.The Gilded Age effectively came to an end with the Panic of 1893-97 that resulted in the worst economic depression in American history until the Great Depression less than 30 years later. The staggering disparity in wealth distribution that was the hallmark of The Gilded Age and the crippling economic effects of the Panic triggered a huge rise in the popularity of labor organizations, anti-Capitalist political groups, and ever escalating acts of violence by Anarchists. The assassination in September 1900 of newly reelected President William McKinley by an anarchist at the opening of the Buffalo World's Fair officially ended The Gilded Age and ushered in the Progressive Era, which brought about amazing advances in social justice and economic equality that all have been inexorably reversed since the Reagan Revolution of 1980, with the elevation of Vice President Theodore Roosevelt to the Presidency, an outcome seen as just as outrageous by ""mainstream"" politicians in 1900 as the elevation of Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson to the Presidency in Nov 1963 with the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.",10
"Very, very good so far!!","I generally enjoy any movie set in the the gilded age of NYC. Seeing where all the old money settled in the industrial age, and as a result the beautiful mansions that sprung up around Central Park. And how classism among the wealthy played out. I see why they did not have much inkling to put all their separatist energy into other races. So far, I'm am enjoying this HBO series. Just binged the first 5 episodes and I like how the story is not one dimensional. It concentrates on life, good or bad of several characters. Loving seeing Cynthia Nixon in a really different role from Sex in the City. Shows her acting chops!",8
"Completely obsessed with this series! Reading Anderson Coopers's book about the Vanderbilt's brought this to life.","I recently read Anderson Cooper's book, Vanderbilt, The Rise and Fall of an American Dynasty, and many of the characters in this series are based on the real life people in this series. The Russels are Alva and William Kissam Vanderbilt. Nathan Lane plays Ward McAllister to perfection! The costumes, the soundtrack, not to mention the acting of Christine Baranski Carrie Coon, Morgan Spector, Louisa Jacobson and Denee Benton, to name a few is incredible. The sets are stunning and the writing of Julian Fellowes captures the history and the ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" of the Gilded Age. I highly recommend the official podcast that goes along with the series, for background on each episode. Fantastic and historically accurate!",10
"Not quite there","Have only watched a couple of episodes but am invested enough to keep watching. Storylines are quite interesting but lack the sparkle of Downton Abbey.The CGI is not very good, the created sets are too clean and there is no sense of them being lived in, and the interior lighting of actors is spectacularly terrible, not matching their surroundings in any way whatsoever.",7
"Created account to review","I do not understand why someone would rate a 1 star! It's a period drama, with a range of characters and stories and it's fun to watch - isn't that what TV is supposed to be? For those of you wanting more depth go watch a play for goodness sake but leave the rest of us to just enjoy something light hearted & entertaining.",9
"I'm ready to cancel HBO","I certainly hope this gets better. With the prices of all the streaming channels going up, this is just the latest dud. I'm bored and nothing so far makes me want to even finish episode one. Update: It did get better after restarting and rewatching but it was not a casual watch. I had to pause and rewind.",7
"Don't Be Silly","Some of these reviews are a little comical. Do you really think we want to watch a bunch of people walking amongst piles of garbage and holding their noses to shield themselves from each others' stench? I'll forsake a little historical accuracy in exchange for something pleasurable to watch. If I want to see 100% historical accuracy about the era, I'll watch a documentary.Downton Abbey wasn't always historically accurate either nor did it always depict relationships between the classes as they likely were back then. Who cares? It makes for a good story. I enjoyed Downton Abbey and have enjoyed the first season of The Gilded Age, particularly the season finale. I'm very much looking forward to Season 2.",10
"These bad reviews are ludicrous","The disdain from these wannabe entertainment industry troll reviewers is comical. This is a very good show. I wonder how high one's must be to complain about the acting. These are solid pros, and they all preform as such.Bottom line: If you like to follow a good story, and enjoy history pieces, check it out. You won't be disappointed. If you are a pretentious, bitter troll, post a bad review.",9
"Kudos to Julian Fellowes for the best series in many years: The Gilded Age.","I want to commend Julian Fellowes for once again helping to create an excellent series. This is the best series I have watched in many years. It is refreshing to view a series in which most of the characters depicted are good, decent people. There may be some greed in the Russel family, but they are not inherently evil people. It is so refreshing to view a series with no obscene and profane cursing. So many other writers resort to inserting curse words as a crutch to make a series seem more ""relevant."" A great writer is eloquent enough naturally and can select words that might occasionally express some anger, but does not stoop to the lowest common denominator. The beautifully composed orchestral score, and lavishly made costumes are icing on the cake. We are treated to women wearing real velvet and real satin. There is no substitute for it. I sincerely hope that Julian Fellowes will remain involved with this series for many years to come in the future. Sincerely, Judy in Santa Monica, CA on February 3, 2022.",10
"It's NOT Downton Abby people Get over it","This show is wonderful, and I can't wait to watch it every week. I've been watching since the first episode aired. Everyone that keeps comparing it to Downton Abby needs to STOP. This is nothing like it, relax and just enjoy the show.I love how the new money wants to be seen but the old money wants them to disappear. It's great and so much fun to watch the dark humor happening.I enjoyed Downton Abby a lot but I. Did not go into this show expecting it to be anything like it, so ignore all the other reviews comparing it Downton Abby and form your own. But remember it's not Downton Abby, it's a show of its own.",10
"Excellent Writing, Acting and Stunningly Beautiful","Not since Downton Abbey have I enjoyed a television series more than The Guilded Age! The cast and storylines are superb. Christine Baranski is flawless as ""Aunt Agnes"" and Morgan Spector stands out in his role as Mr. Russell as well.",10
"Exciting Show","This is an exciting and interesting show. I have watched this over and over, at least four times through, already! It never becomes boring and every aspect of it is beautiful and interesting. Lots of dry and witty humor and every detail is exquisite. The cast and crew did a phenomenal job!",10
"Love the sets the costumes but the actors are bad","This show seriously needs British actors who can play these aristocrats to a T. Some are good in this period drama but others are too modern Carrie Coon is a fine actress but I can't get past her modern era delivery of her lines, but the young actor who plays her son is British and he's quite good in his small role.",7
"Not Downton Abby, but enjoyable to watch..","Only 2 episodes in and I'm enjoying the period drama. Better then watching shows with explosive scenes that show killing and maiming . We have enough of that on the news. The costumes are lovely. Story is getting interesting.",8
"It just simply isn't done","Season 1: The creators of Downton Abbey & Belgravia Julian Fellowes return this time taking us away from the Aristocracy of Europe to the Americans with the Gilded Age. A Young woman named Marian(Louisa Jacobson) after the death of her father with no money is forced to leave and heads to New York to live with her two Aunts Agnes(Christine Baranski) and Brook(Cynthia Nixon). While trying to find her place in life drama in society starts to occur when a new money family the Russells moves into the area as the wife tries to work her way her husband Morgan is making a big wave in the industrialist market. This led to a series of Dramas between the two families. The show as a whole isn't bad the characters are all pretty likable for various reasons on her own Marian isn't the most interesting person, but sort of a more outspoken progressive attitude in interactions with everybody. I found the connection between her and Peggy to feel believable she is naive, but she means well. With Peggy, the show doesn't whitewash it and make it outright clear a black woman of the time wasn't treated the best and had hardship, but they add a nice little subplot with her and her family that leaves on a powerful note. Arguably the best characters in the shows are Agnes & The Russell's. Agnes is more or less what you expect out of a show like this. She's very bitter and serious and does not condone unorthodox behavior and messing with the ""natural"" order of things. She hands done gets the best lines out of everybody and delivers them with such Sass. Morgan Russell is probably the most surprising, to say the least, because with him you think you getting this robber Baron character. A cold cutthroat who cares about nothing but money. Strangely he's the most likable character he's ruthless and isn't afraid to take action when needed. However, at no point do you feel like his actions are unjustified, given how the rest of society treats his family you don't blame his ruthlessness. While his wife is busy winning everybody over, He more or less doesn't give a damn about what anybody thinks. Among a series of other events, he thinks about the realistic approach and doesn't jeopardize himself or his family. The show has its shortcomings The Gilded Age itself makes for an excellent setting for a period drama. It was a time when the rich prospered through Monopolizing and cutthroat tactics under the gold Cloak there was this dirty and corrupt society. Unfortunately, the show doesn't bother with any of that. It focuses on the high society, the music, and the Costumes are beautiful, but never really gets to the seedy underbelly of the period. No Labour Unions or Muckrakers or perspective of any the working class outside of the house servants. However, the servants aren't as relevant here as in Downton Abbey. So, a lot of the uniqueness it could have had is just not there.Season 2: With the world and characters established Season 2 begins to double down on the drama with the characters all being more fleshed out and addressing some of the criticism of the first season. While still having Miss Russell trying to rise higher in society and her ongoing war with Agnes and her colleagues an old associate also returns to cause trouble for the Russells. While also still focusing on the Elite it also focuses on the working class which was lacked a little in the 1st Not just the situations with the Servants, but also Peggy's situation with her family and coming to grips with the loss of her son the black community struggle as well as Mr. Russell dealing with the Conflict of Unions.",7
"Money in the wrong place...","They spent WAY too much money trying to faithfully match the time period and forgot to pay decent writers for a watchable storyline.Boring soap opera where the only real thing of interest are the sets and costumes. The performances, storylines, characters.. all rather drab.I don't know if anyone else will catch this.. but the theme music is just the West World theme reworked a bit - tempo changed, some staccato notes used rather than long notes. If you compare.. it's the same basic note structure with merely tempo changes.It also makes little sense.. in the late 19th or early 20th century, this family is terribly worried about class distinction between ""old"" and ""new"" money in New York.. yet they hire a black woman, the only black woman in the neighborhood, to be a personal secretary and live in the house. So class bigotry is okay, but racism apparently only exists in coach drivers??Now, racism is bad, a horrible thing which should never be portrayed as ""good"" or ""beneficial"" because it never is. It is however a a shameful part of US history - including in New York. To pretend it doesn't exist in this time period makes all the money spent on sets and costumes seem haphazard. If you wish to rewrite history, why isn't everyone wearing short-skirts, board shorts, beanies and Uugs?? Why focus so much on ""reality"" where sets and costumes are concerned, but then ignore ""reality"" where attitudes and mindsets of the times are concerned? Sorry.. I hate this word.. but this comes across as ""woke"" propaganda attempting to at least minimally rewrite history. I don't mean to imply outright racism should be shown in the series. Not at all... but immediate acceptance of Ms. Scott by EVERYONE, other than the odd coach driver, is simply not true to the time period. This is fiction, clearly, with little basis in reality.",2
"Don't listen to the nay sayers","The people giving this series a bad review obviously don't know what they're taking about. Excellently crafted and the entire cast shines. I binge watched it in two days.",9
"Don't bail so fast - it's awesome!","I'm amazed at the low reviews given by people who either bailed out in episode one or who are disappointed it's not Downton Abbey.To those who quit early and left a low rating on the way out, your presumption speaks poorly of you and dinged a marvelous series. Emphasis on series here - there is some necessary character development in the first couple of episodes as well as some world building for most of us who aren't so aware of the historic era known as the Gilded Age. This groundwork is critical, and as we pass episode 3 and look ahead, it's paying off wonderfully!To those who complain ""it's no Downton Abbey,"" well, of course not. How tedious that would be rather than this fresh look at another time and place where social norms and class roles are changing. In that it shares some similarities, but as a full-blooded DA fan, I find myself loving TGA all on its own merits.The cast is really clicking now, with my top kudos to Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector as Bertha and George Russell - such terrific chemistry and performances! I certainly would not want to get on the wrong side of Bertha or George. By the time you finish episode 3 - and please do so! - you will know what I mean about these two great actors and their characters.Christine Baranski is her usual top tier performer as Aunt Agnes, and a gritty contrast to a sweet Aunt Ada played to great effect by Cynthia Nixon. Their scenes are richly layered.Thanks to the production team and Denee Benton for her wonderfully designed and developed character of Peggy Scott, through whom we see race concerns of their time and our own developed in a compelling way without the crass wokeness so overly done elsewhere. This role in particular has tremendous potential and Benton is nailing the opportunity so far.I'm still working on liking Louisa Jacobson's take on Marian and the young niece as a character. Both the actress and her character are in the midst of so many strong players, it will be interesting to see how Louisa/Marian rises to her own standing amongst them.Add to this so many excellent ancillary characters and it's a robust world of dynamic people and events we find ourselves in, never sure who to root for or what will become of the ones we do.Yes, I love it, but only because there is so much in it to love! Don't give up on it; there's more here than a brief look in will show you.",10
"Evolving Beautifully","As a devout fan of Downton Abbey I think the reviews of the Gilded Age that are left here are unfair. It's clear that some people expected different things or you had preconceived expectations that were not met. That's a mistake that you cannot make as a good critic. I think the acting is fine I have viewed the entire season; it has evolved beautifully with very few loose ends. Just enough to build on for the next season. I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves a period piece.",10
"A guilty pleasure!","The critics don't seem to like it, at least certainly not the British ones. So what? Never be told by a critic what you should and shouldn't watch!This is a pleasure to watch. There are some sparkling performances, with some acid wit, from an excellent ensemble cast.Money has clearly been poured into the sets and costumes and it all looks magnificently elegant.I am looking forward to Season 2!",9
"Definitely Not Downton Abbey!","Great cast, good acting but historically inaccurate as far as social modes and customs. It does not reflect how people really lived as far as how they acted. More so, why didn't they choose better storylines like how railroads were actually constructed instead of dreaming up plots that don't fit well with how track lines were placed and actual companies were developed? Also, the characters are not that likeable, except a few: Marion, Peggy. Most are snobby, self centered and, in some cases, downright mean. If one can't find a way to like characters, then how can you emphasize with them in their plight? I can't get that attachment I had with the characters in Downton because I don't like them. In the podcasts, Julian Fellowes sounds equally snobbish and this was a turnoff. The plotline runs a little flat too. Unfortunately for all the attractive sets, scenery and costumes, it's a great disappointment. Keep your upper class airs and snobber. I'd rather read a book or view beautiful artwork. Sorry, but I don't care for it.",8
"Snooty rich people","Christine Baranski is a great actress. Aunt Agnes's character seems a miserable old woman. I would hope back in the times, people wouldn't be so disagreeable.I enjoy the costumes, architecture, decor and the rest of the characters.",8
"incredibly boring historical nonsense","This series is pretty far from being historically accurate but being accurate doesn't seem to matter any more I guess. Still it's what's not shown that would turn this from the farce it is into something worth watching. Keep in mind that this period coincided with the rapid expansion of america and the industrial revolution but mass production of consumer goods was still a ways off as well as mass and personal transportation that didn't involve animals. Before modern sanitation and common understanding of sanitation, bacteria and viruses, most people, at some time in their life, succumbed to at least one major illness and most likely a major life threatening injury. So before modern advances in chemistry, electrification, and telephony, and refrigeration and cooling systems. So even in high society areas of new york, most people would be appalled at the standard of living. There would be feces and garbage everywhere. The smell would be like living in a 3rd world country today. The houses would be mostly filthy which is why they had large staff in the first place. The kitchens extremely unsanitary and toilet facilities fit for a dive bar in oakland. And clothes...clothing fabric would be rather dull, hard to clean and maintain, and handmade. So considering the show is not even remotely period accurate what is the point and how far off are they to portraying society of the day. Well, most people of that period drank and it was a pretty male dominated society, and there was a common belief that most women suffered from 'vapors' and the houses they lived in were pretty chemically toxic and dangerous which people took all sorts of chemical cocktails to suffer through. To someone modern day, I suspect it would something like a madhouse, but more interesting than this boring, cliche riddled drama. The dialog is the worst part. I'd rather listen to cats mating than any more of this tripe.This period also coincides with the victorian era in england. I don't claim to be an expert on victorian england but I have watched quite a few productions on life in england at the time which mirrored american life. But, you won't find many productions on life in america, while the english seem to be perpetually fascinated by their past. So if you want to know a little something about america after the civil war and up to the 1900s, there are plenty of english stories to start with. Or, if you're ever in DC make a point of visiting the Lee mansion in arlington (particularly in the summer) where high society has been preserved since the 1860s.Yeah, I know they're not making a documentary but it's remarkable how many people use these shows to fill their history library.",6
"A Quiet Masterpiece","The reviewers that don't like this show have the taste of a Neanderthal. What pray tell is not to like? The settings, costumes, and cinematography alone render it stellar material. Add the superb acting into the mix with Mr Fellowes sensitive and insightful writing and we have one for the ages. Miss Richardson-Whitfield has done an extraordinary job directing. And yes, that is the Salli Richardson who used to make badass movies alongside Mario Van Peeples! I'm in awe. Nathan Lane steals every scene he's in. Bravo to all concerned. Bravo! Despite what the credits say, its Christine Baranski's show! She's nothing short of wonderful.",10
"Really not that bad","Ok, it was obvious everyone was going to compare this with Downton Abbey which was good but definitely not flawless. It was a high end soap opera. If the Gilded Age is just that, then what is the problem? It don't think its trying to be anything else really. It's good looking entertainment and what's wrong with that? Let's give it some time and the benefit of the doubt. There are worse things to look at. Sometimes you need 'The Knick' and sometimes you need this. It's pretty, light and entertaining and pretty well made, let's be honest. I will keep watching, it sure as hell beats watching the news and the likes of Putin and Covid-19.",7
"nothing is saved!","The plot, the writing and the acting are just HORRIBLE and I say that being kind carie coon is bad It's not worth you wasting your precious time watching this! But if you enjoy watching grown-ups act and act like kids, this show is for you!",1
"Seriously?","I'd like to understand how on earth this ridiculously bad show with it's cardboard characters, stunted direction, mind numbing writing, and misguided scenery chewing by actors (who should know better), has been allowed to drone on for another season, while outstanding shows like First Lady, and the marvelous Lakers series were slapped down after one season?What's happened to HBO? Where has their greatness gone?And another thing, I find it laughable that with all the horses working on the show, I haven't seen one pile of manure or giant puddle of equine urine on the street. Where does it all go?During this time in history, New York City was plagued by flies and rats, yes even in better neighborhoods, so where are they? If they were included at least we might be compelled to watch. I'd set my hair on fire to see Christine Baranski play one of her consistently snotty scenes with a fly on the end of her nose, or rat run up her leg.",8
"Don't compare to Downtown","If you are expecting Downtown, you will be disappointed. If you are open minded and just watch for the enjoyment of a historical series with pretty sets and some soap opera drama, this will hit the spot. Nathan Lane was the highlight of the series for me, I think the casting brings back some great people into the spotlight and allows upcoming actors to play off of the experienced actors. Each has a respectable role that adds to the series. The aunts banter is amazing. It dives just enough into the political issues of the time and balances it well with the societal priorities of the era. Enjoy it for what it is and don't compare, it is entertaining.",10
"People reviewing the show at 2-3 stars after two episodes make me sick","The show's clearly going for something ambitious, probably beyond the scale of Downton when all's said and done, and it is more than worthy of anyone's time. I'm not really sure if it's at 10 star level yet, but I'm buying in early and saying that I get the sense that this is going to be right up there with the best of them when the payoffs start rolling in.Pros: Music, Costumes, Carrie Coon (and like the entire ensemble for that matter)
Cons: It's a little slow if you're only in it for the plot, but this is a television show can you not just like watch it with your entire body and appreciate the full sensory experience instead of insisting on consuming every form of media in the same easily digestible sparknote pace, yeah you're not getting red light green light level action gory death and dopamine fueled rampage episode one, but you get to listen to the funny accents and the cool music and the insane set design like ok just watch it its good.",10
"Near perfect.","I'm a huge fan of Jullian Fellowes. I've watched Downton completely 3 times. Is it as good? Maybe not quite. BUT it has a similar feel. The production values are perfect. The music is perfect. Complaining about historical accuracy? Give me a break. It's fiction loosely based on history. Christine Baranski, Cynthia Nixone and Nathan Lane......theater royalty! Whenever they are on screen you can't look away. Oh, the dramatics! I love watching this and can't wait for the next episode. I will be sad when the current season ends. Update: This is the first 10 star rating I've given. The main reason? Simply because it brings me so much joy. I watch every episode at least twice. They are so rich with detail. The acting is perfect, especially Christine Baranski and Cybthia Nixon. The nuances, the subtle glances every expression is just right. I've found myself smiling at the little discoveries. The characters are complex, not all good or bad. This is Prestige Television! I never want it to end.",10
"Suspend belief!","Judging by the majority of TV and movie entertainment being produced these days, it seems that most people prefer violent action, police/crime drama, futuristic fiction or reality shows. A generation of viewers has been raised on this stuff. So when a show like ""The Gilded Age"" comes along, it's easy to understand why there are so many negative reviews. Every criticism possible in the user reviews has been made about its ""inadequacies"". But as a viewer who doesn't enjoy any of today's popular genres (no ""NCIS"" or ""CSI"", no ""Star Wars"", no ""Peoples' Court"", no ""Survivor"" nor ""Big Brother"" and definitely not the Kardashians) I have thoroughly enjoyed watching season one of ""The Gilded Age."" And it's not because it's different from what is currently popular. I'm already looking forward to watching season two. Here's why:It's historical, giving viewers a perspective of our country at a time when America was growing and changing rapidly. Anything that refers to our country's history today gets called ""woke"" because so much of our history isn't pleasant to think about. While ""The Gilded Age"" is part fiction and part fact-based, it gives us insight on how New York society functioned at the time, and how it affected the rest of the country. New York was at the forefront of invention and industry. The costumes, architecture and attention to detail are fascinating. Suspend your belief and you'll be enthralled in the surroundings.The acting is sensational! Anyone familiar with Broadway recognizes the Tony award winning and nominated cast and each actor shines in his/her role. It's the relationships between the characters that create the intrigue, and I love the interactions between sisters Agnes and Ada (Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon) nouveau riche George and Bertha (Morgan Spector and Carrie Coon) and even the lead butlers, Church and Bannister (Jack Gilpin and Simon Jones.) Watching pivotal characters beautifully portrayed by Donna Murphy (Mrs. Astor), Nathan Lane (Ward McAllister), Kelli O'Hara (Aurora Fane) and Jeanne Tripplehorn (Mrs. Chamberlain) has been delightful. And the relationship at the core of the story, between Peggy Scott (Denee Benton) and Marian Brook (Louisa Jacobson) is inspirational. Their friendship is reflective of how, ever so slowly at that time, people of different races could come together to support each other. Denee Benton reminds me of a young Cicely Tyson. She's dynamic in every scene she's in.The writing is crisp and clever, and it lends itself to strong character development. We quickly get to know each character and the motives, desires, strengths and weaknesses they weave into the storyline. Some characters get their comeuppance, some get rewarded and some just entertain by being themselves; every interaction contributes to what is about to happen next. Julian Fellowes is a master at developing characters who make you care about them, so we are eager to see them meet their fates.Many user reviews rate ""The Gilded Age"" against ""Downton Abbey"" because they were both written by Julian Fellowes. It's unfair to do that, even though they are both period pieces and it's tempting to compare. From a historical perspective, America was still a young country during the 1880's; England's history was many centuries longer. The societies functioned so differently, especially because America had only a decade before fought a Civil War.""The Gilded Age"" might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for people tired of the ""reality"" that pervades entertainment today, it's a welcome relief that could teach as well as entertain.",10
"Wonderful","Wonderful and witty. Can't wait for another season. Characters are so well played and realistic to the time and era. Some many wonderful actors in this lovely historical piece of history. I highly recommend this to be watched as our history is being erased by those whom are so offended. I find it stimulating and fresh to see a series so dedicated to the preservation of of our American culture and the wonders that America had brought forth. Hopefully it won't be too long before the 3rd season of this fabulous story will be out to enjoy. Looking forward to seeing what they have to show us next. Fantastic.",9
"An Honest Review","At first I was apprehensive to watch The Gilded Age, but after some convincing, I am finally through the first two seasons. Let me begin with a single statement,'The source material and storylines are aplenty, somewhat overwhelming at first.'However, it seems that after further story development, character development and the addition of some long running cliffhangers, I am sure there are some who are celebrating this show as a triumph, others who were somewhat disappointed and many who would prefer that each season could be longer.I will not give away spoilers or for that matter deny those looking for great entertainment a chance to enjoy what can only be said is the best period drama produced for American & Global Television since Downton Abbey.Ironically both are created by a man who requires no introduction and for many is loved and adored for his immensely immersive and captivating writing.Lord Julian Fellowes (his correct title) is truly the Lord of period dramas and someone who cannot be matched at this point. Yes I am aware that there are great period dramas out there (Outlander, Sanditon, Bridgeton, The Crown, etc) but it is Julian and his partner in crime, Gareth Neame's, passion to historical detail, set design and costumes that truly make the story even more immersive.Emmy & Golden Globe worthy in many respects.Turning our attention back to the show, one can say that it seems Julian is writing with sense of fear in his mind that he will fall foul of the American's love of cancelling popular shows purely on financial and viewership numbers alone. The Gilded Age is very much like Downton Abbey in the beginning of its development. Viewership numbers for Downton were low in the beginning and blossomed into its cult status by season 4 after it won countless awards and garnered attention globally as an escapist show of soft/heavy drama with a somewhat wide array of storylines to follow.With The Gilded Age, everything is tied up in a tidy bow with impeccable set design, a stellar cast with new and well-known faces, storylines that enter and end prematurely, other storylines taking giant leaps forward in the space of a few episodes, and subplot storylines developing into part of the mainstream over time. It is writing of the highest calibre and one that must be acknowledged and celebrated.Thank you Julian and Gareth for writing and focusing on all the struggles faced by all classes, races and genders in that time, it is a great privilege to watch such historical depictions being done in a tasteful and acceptable manner whilst still being inclusive and correct historically.I will, however, add a warning to those who are sticklers or critics of a trend that seems to follow period dramas around these days. An over simplification of history, history correction or the retelling of history from a different perspective. Sadly this is something that seems to becoming a recurrent problem in today's television shows and major films. Sadly history cannot be oversimplified as its history and cannot be rewritten. Whilst I may not agree with every scene and style taken by Julian in some regards to story, the overall development of the story is immensely satisfying and if one can overlook some of the simplifications, then this show can be heralded as one to be remembered.I truly hope that this show develops the same cult like following of Downton Abbey and other period dramas that have trail-blazed the way for this series to even exist.This is a much watch but only for those who truly appreciate this type of drama and storytelling.Well done to the entire cast and crew for the incredible work on this series. I cannot wait for Season 3.My only request to HBO... order more episodes please.8 episodes per season is painfully to little for such an incredible series. You did it for GOT, Westworld and Boardwalk Empire, why not for The Gilded Age?",6
"It's fine","This could have been so much better. I'm so interested in the history of NY and the people that lived here. The sets are gorgeous. The actors are good. But there is ZERO character development. So you end up not really caring about any of the characters. And the series was apparently shot with a wide angle lens for many scenes, which distorts the surroundings. The depth of field is so shallow that there's no sense of reality in the scenes. From the makers of Downton Abbey, who did the opposite of what I just listed in DA and therefore made it immersive, this is a shallow version of something that could have been magical.",10
"It's eye candy","I love the time period of this TV series. New York City, being built up. I think it's one hundred and thirty or forty years ago. The beginning of electricity. But, the most spectacular thing is the attire of the cast. It is amazing. The colors and ruffles of their clothes. I sit and study the stitching. I love it! The way the beautiful dresses are designed is outstanding! Plus, the setting and design of their houses. It leaves me in awe. I can not wait to see what the ladies and gentlemen are wearing each week. As well as whose beautiful house will be shown. Hopefully it will be Mr and Mrs Russell's house. The grandest and most spectacular of them all!!",6
"Not hitting the right buttons","I really wanted to like this. No, I was ready to absolutely LOVE it. But, episode after episode it is becoming clear that it's more style than substance. I can't really put my finger on it, but something feels off- no chemistry between the characters, boring, predictable, shallow plots, uninspiring dialogues... I can't connect with any of the characters, they just leave me flat, like... ok, whatever. Which is sad, because it's clear that a lot of money was spent on the production, and it's HBO... it should be awesome. Julian Fellows should have taken a page from the, for example, ""The Age of Innocence"" for a great Gilded Age drama.6/10 and I'm being generous.",2
"Rich People are Dull","Can't tell if rich people are just boring or if the acting is just flat out bad. There is extremely limited chemistry between actors/actresses. I don't think I will continue watching.",10
"Amazing","Awesome and entertaining!The sets, the clothes, the actors make this series really special.It also highlites how incredibly RICH these people were for their time.Vanderbilt was worth over $100 MILLION in 1900.That would be over $200 BILLION today.",8
"Enjoyable period piece","I expected Downton Abbey but make it America and to some extent I got it. The big name actors (Coon, Baranski, Nixon, Spector) play their parts well. I feel Louisa Jacobson (Marian Brooks) is out of her depth. She delivers her lines poorly and with very little emotion. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the show because there's plenty of drama and the houses and costume design are spectacular. I'm hoping season 2 will be bigger and better.",9
"Definitely picks up throughout the season","I wonder how many of these reviewers watched the whole season and also how many recall watching Downton in the early going. The first couple of episodes for both were a bit of a struggle before the stories started to come together. By the end of the first season, it was a shame there weren't more episodes. I'm pretty sure this will take in the Emmys and really hope that Denée Benton is recognized for her great performance as Peggy Scott.",10
"Can't Wait for Season 2!","As a long time fan of Downton Abbey, I didn't think any other period drama could come close to the quality, intrigue, and creativity, but I was very wrong. The Gilded Age has been an extremely pleasant surprise and I've enjoyed each and every episode. The costumes are incredible, and the writing has been too-notch. Character development was slow and intentional so you could really start to appreciate each character for who they are and the individual contributions to the storyline. I'm most interested in seeing some more character development for the downstairs cast. Now that Jack and some of the others are starting to get more screen time, I think it will be great to see those characters develop into integral pieces of the story. Can't wait for Season 2!",10
"I love this period show!","This period show is high quality.Stars, Costumes, Production, Script, Story.I love watching this kind of show.It's very entertaining.Thank God it doesn't have unnecessary sex scenes like Bridgerton.",8
"Starts slow then hurtles forward","I was disappointed in the first episode of The Gilded Age, but by the second I was hooked. Julian Fellows has done it again, masterfully weaving together a large cast and many stories into a rich New York 1880's tapestry both upstairs and downstairs. The breadth of Broadway talent alone is breathtaking: Christine Baranski, Cynthia Nixon, Audra McDonald, Nathan Lane, Kellie O'Hara, Michael Cerveris and Donna Murphy -Tony winners all, plus Katie Finneran, Carrie Coon, Dénée Benton, Jack Gilpin, guests Linda Emond and Bill Irwin and many more. Did they need their Tonys (and Tony nominations) to get into lunch? Superb cast, excellent costumes and sets and writing that improves episode by episode.",6
"I Gave It A Full Season","Fair or not, I can't help but compare this to Downton Abbey. In almost all respects it is inferior.I don't find myself caring about any of these characters and some of the casting is bothersome. Who did not like Bates after episode 1 of Downton? But there is no Bates, Violet, Anna, Thomas, Sybil or Mr. Carsen to be found here. The acting is inconsistent, but the very best are just as good as on Downton, however they lack the charisma of those actors.The plot is mildly intriguing, but I defy anyone to come up with any moment in the entire first season that can match Episode 3 of Downton when the Turkish diplomat dies in Mary's bed and the upstairs and downstairs conspire together to conceal what has happened. There is nothing in the entire season of Gilded to match that one scene in DowntonThe sets....look like sets. The CGI is too obvious.Also, while I admire Fellowes the storyteller, I think his writing can be a bit silly. He seemed able to constrain himself for the most part in Downton, but the worse of his writing attributes flourish hereIt's not horrible, but with so many other choices I won't be watching S2.",10
"Excellent period piece from HBO","""The Gilded Age"" is a great series, showing the differences between old money and new money in late 1800s New York. I feel that next season should have Agnes and Bertha in more scenes together.It was also great to see the black middle and upper-middle classes on screen. There was an episode where Marian visited Peggy's neighborhood. Her expression was one of surprise, like she had never seen well-to-do black people before. It was both funny and sad. I am betting we will see more of Peggy Scott's family next season as well.I also have a strong feeling that Larry Russell and Marian Brook are going to be involved romantically next season.",7
"A fun escape show","The Guilded Age, on HBO Max (first season)I'm enjoying this show though it feels out of character for me. Especially now. I gravitate to Indie films, historical, socio-political and music documentaries, Graham Norton's chat show, and Finding Your Roots. As it turns out, I needed this show. Especially now. It's a soap opera upstairs-downstairs of the uber wealthy in 1882 New York. Who cares, right? Pretty costumes, actresses going home with bruised ribs because they are wearing dangerous corsets, (okay, this upsets me). It nothing to do with my life, my fight for justice in an unjust world, my disgust and worry about war and the inane politicians whose hypocritcal, self absorbed interests fuel human sufffering. This is exactly what I love about this series.It started out slowly, picked up a bit, but continues to mosy on. The lead actress is sweet and likeable. It's fun to watch Christine Baransky, Cynthia Nixon, and other actors I should know but don't bicker about status. The storylines are easy to follow. Bad guy. Good guy. Hmm. Is this guy bad or good? What color beautiful dress will she wear next? Is the show historically accurate? Is it a bad knock off of Downton Abbey? I don't really care. I didn't watch Downton Abbey. What I do care about is that it took mind away from Ukrainian bunkers and Russians being starved of their money due to covert war.I'll watch the next season, but if I don't, that will be okay too. UPDATE: After episode nine I am now hooked on this show!",2
"Shockingly poorly written","Who wrote this?The language is dull, always expository (why are you here), shockingly anachronistic, and just flat as a board. No one was described as ""nice"" or said ""hello"" in greeting. Have the writers read James or Wharton? Did anyone supervise this script?",8
"Lost points for Cynthia Nixon's acting","Watching Cynthia Nixon was like seeing Robin Williams play an old woman in Mrs. Doubtfire except that Cynthia wasn't trying to be funny in her overacting. It is an over the top poor performance and she keeps reminding me I'm in my living room watching tv: it is impossible to lose myself and my surroundings such as I can with 1883 wherein the whole world melts away for an hour .Kudos to the casting of Christine Baranski, however, who is so convincing and deliciously enjoyable to watch for such an otherwise unlikeable character. I believe Carrie Coon will also prove the same in time.As for the rest? Meh. Indifferent.",10
"A Period Drama Done Right!","The Gilded Age is a must-watch show. The cast, the writing, the sets, costumes-all wonderfully done and delivered. It is so much better than other period pieces out there, it's glaringly noticeable.",7
"Mannered opulence","As a portrayal of decadence and excess coupled with callous disregard and unbridled ambition it's pretty good - mannered opulence, would be another way to put it.Will the mighty fall or will the upstarts get what's coming to them? So much 'vaulting ambition' in some corners and naive innocence in others - bulldogs, Sgt Majors, shrinking violets, and their servants.It's definitely OTT but also entertaining and sumptuous.",8
"Not Downton Abbey","Many reviewers have stated that this programme is not as good as Downton Abbey, & that it is not historically correct.Downton Abbey was not correct in the way the downstairs staff interacted with the upstairs characters.This is not Downton Abbey & has to be judged on it's own merits.It is a story more about the good & bad people within the programme, the lavish production is eye candy to cheer for one character, & boo for another.Remember folks, it's a story, & not a history channel documentary.I am enjoying the backstabbing & shenanigans of the upper & lower classes.",9
"Fabulous!","Well I don't know what all these reviews are going on about, I bl00dy loved it! Yes it's cheesy and full of stereotypes but it was a few hours of pure escapism and the costumes were just mesmerising! Can't wait for season 2.",8
"Not Great but I Still Love It","Nothing really great happens but I'm loving it, just like I loved the latter season of Downtown Abbey -- after Mathew died -- which, come on, nothing really great happened either. It's very much a Julain Fellowes production - deliciously old-fashioned and prudish, lavish and well-acted, with the highlights being the posh and witty way in which the characters engage each other.",10
"Loving it more as the series continues!","The writing is superb and the casting is perfect. I expect the storylines and dialogue are as close to the time period as possible.I'm continuously amazed to see how much emphasis was placed on societal status and community stature by the early Americans. One would think they'd have chosen to break away from the pretentiousness created by a monarchy they freed themselves from. Still, I know to some extent, snobbishness still exists today.I'm not pleased that the two black male characters have major flaws; one is a cheater and the other a baby snatcher. Really? And Peggy shouldn't be forced to leave the paper, but I'm sure something wonderful is in her future and no doubt a great love too.What's up with the green dress and the weird bodice ribs that Mrs. Scott is always seen in?! Surely they can afford her a full wardrobe! And covering it up with a gray housecoat doesn't conceal the fact that she's still wearing that same fugly green dress in every scene. Speaking of dresses...most of the time Marian looks great, but sometimes she shows up in a ghastly outfit that looks as if a 12 year old made it in home ec!The story of the cast-off shoes was an unnecessary disappointment and poorly done. Pitiful display of power from production that seems to reflect today's issues more than anything. I get Marian's naïveté - but considering her humble beginnings - it probably wasn't uncommon for her to share hand-me-downs among friends. I understand how the Scotts would be offended by the gesture, but their anger was over-the-top, their treatment of Marion was ungracious and for Peggy to scold her in the street was ridiculous.I'm so glad Marian has found her true love!I love the Russells! Yay for Borden and Bruce...but why is she a Mrs.? Maybe Church and Miss Andre will connect?I'm thrilled for Ada...she should hire her own ladies maid now. WTG John and Watson!! Hope the McNeils and Collier roles continue. Love Agnes' character!I hope The Raikes make another appearance down the road once Marian and Larry get settled. Tom will undoubtedly tire of that Munchkin voice. LOL!Mamie is a riot!I've watched the series several times and find subtle nuances every time I do. I look forward to season three and I hope all the regulars continue!",7
"Like but don't love.","I would still watch this if it had 100 episodes. Took a minute to find affection for some of the characters. Anyways....is Nathan Lane's character purposely a caricature? I cringe at his overwrought ""accent"". Really y'all? All the Frickenfriedchicken southern actors in the world and that's it? Wonder if Lane asked the director, whuut iz mah mohhhtavahhshuunnn?"" It's like watching a Birdcage/GWTW crossover on The Goes Wrong Show. Jesus, Mary Lou, and Bubba!! Cast Leslie Jordan next season please. Another B rated moment is when ""progressive"" Aunt Agnes gives her whited blessing to Ms. Scott and the camera shows a closeup of the ""touch"". There was the balanced reality that the deceitful maid was not fired for making Scott's life miserable. Justice spoken but not served. I really like Mrs. Russell and pulling for her only in my fantasy. Waiting for Oscar's big fall and Mrs. Van Rhign's vapors to shut down that house. Impressive scenery, wondering how that was done and where. Of course, a production can never go wrong with Baranski and Nixon, so there's that.",8
"Gorgeous, lush and needs a few tweaks","So grateful for such a richly realized vision, especially in the sparse daily desert that is Covid! Something is missing though and I have been trying to put my finger on it.I have had the privilege of working across the pond with compatriots for many years and I see time and again how often there is just a fundamental misunderstanding of the breadth and depth of America.Weirdly I think this may be the factor missing here.New York and the still burgeoning Newport are presented as a hub like London, but missing are the many teeming influences that always bleed into a city like New York, which really doesnt exist in the UK.The unruly and overflowing ghettos with immigrants arriving every day, the wild volatility of San Francisco, the wry observations of Mark Twain who coined the term The Gilded Age (he meant it derogatorily as a comment against the 1%), the early metropolis of what would become Chicago- all of these influences are missing here. Spend any significant time in New York and what you understand is that at its core it is a literal melting pot of everything American and often international as well.New York city is the place where one always has the odd sensation of being in the center of it all but also somehow behind the times. There are so many strains of sheer inventiveness it is impossible to keep up. It is difficult to know where or to whom to look and there is the constant feeling of missing something vital and important because there is just too much to take in.Bring in a dose of that America and we will have a 10 out of 10 for sure!!",6
"Style over substance","Season 2 of The Gilded Age starts with hats. Ladies getting elaborate hats on and admiring themselves in the mirrors. I haven't seen Season 1, so I don't know what it started with, but Season 2 starts with hats. And hats are the stars of the show. Hats and dresses. Sure, there are also actors, some of whom are truly excellent, and storylines, some of which are very intriguing. I have a soft spot for shows like this - the ones that put fictional characters against the backdrop of various moments in history. And I did enjoy The Gilded Age, but in the end I felt like I'd just consumed a whole bunch of empty calories, an elaborate dessert without much substance. 19th century Kardashians scheming obsessively over their 19th century status symbols. Minor characters' stories are much more interesting, but they are minor. The setup created an illusion of depth, alas it was just an illusion.Killer opening sequence music though.",5
"Poor writing ruins the show","I looked forward to escaping into a lush historical drama. This is a disappointment after seeing the first 2 episodes. The writing is so banal and the plot lines so predictable. The acting comes across as wooden because the writing is bad. I hope someone does a show about this period that is smart and compelling. I've read novels about this time period and there is a lot of material if someone had a more interesting perspective.Downton at least kept me going for a couple of seasons (gave up when it became too soap opera-y). This one is dead in the water.",10
"From one monarch to the new","While this is of course cast in the vain of Downton, it is so far an equal in production, cast and characters and an enjoyable and believable period piece. To raise one's nose at the similarities is to miss the point, even the US had and has still a class system. This is an excellent show.",8
"My wish comes true","I was always interested in the Gilded Age and now this serie was made and I love it!I am a fan of costume drama's, and I got the impression that there are reviews here of people who are not a fan of that genre.I am not a fan of horror or fantasy films but I will never leave a review about it, I simply donot watch it.",9
"Very good surprise","I only was expecting to be entertained, by some USA Downton Park Avenue thing I didn't heard of, and boy I was.First of all, great job for the amazingly accurate and beautiful costumes / hair / make-up.Second, thanks for actually placing a colored character in an historically accuratish place, not pretending the world was different that it really was.Third, great cast ! All actors are really good, with a spectacular Cynthia Nixon, and a DAMN HOT, ahem, really nice Harry Richardson whose career will explode, I'm pretty sure of it.It's a good show, ok it's not a mindblowing incredible revelation, but after watching five episodes I'm still very entertained, witch is a hard thing to do.",8
"Pride and Prejudice...","...with a racial component? Look, this is a good series. Plain and simple. I lost the Downton Abbey comparisons about 30 minutes into this show. Really good writing, engaging drama, well acted characters. I am hooked. There are some misses with a few period props but it does not really detract from the stories and plot lines. Hey, the naysayers are entitled but IMO this is a good show. Another reason to not let your HBO subscription lapse.",10
"Lovely","I am loving this show so far! I just hope there is more LGBTQ+ scenes/representations in the coming episodes. The drama is so uniquely good when it comes to the social club of that time period. 10/10.",10
"Brilliantly addictive!","I make a habit of rarely watching series until they are over so that I can binge watch rather than waiting an agonising week to know what happens next! Having done just this with Downtown Abbey, and loved it, I understood at last what everyone had been raving about for so long. Alas, bewitched by Julian Fellowes', I couldn't help watching the first episode of The Gilded Age and I am now agonising, week by miserable week, over what might happen next....I see lots of positive reviews, and many negative, but I LOVE this series.... For its wonderful cast, its stunning costumes and set designs, and of course, Julian Fellows's great storyline. Some like blood and gore and a fever pitch of endless menace with everything graphically visceral. I love the subtlety Julian Fellowes brings to all his storylines. Everything is there, heaven and hell, but in a way that leaves his audience hope, and a much needed hope nowadays that good really will overcome evil in the end. The more of Julian Fellowes on our screens the better!",6
"Soap and dull direction","Plod plod plod.... This is disappointing, none of the actors are being given anything more than stilted soap style direction and the story goals and stories are just not that interesting. Flat. Not keno some of the color blind costumes either!",10
"Better than Breaking Bad","Better than Breaking Bad in creating sympathetic villainous protagonists. The dynamics between the characters and classes are so nuanced and complex. As a history major, it offers a romanticized yet emotionally inspiring portrayal of a pivotal time in American history. Add in the refreshing depiction of a Black elite family who still struggles within the racism of the time, this series truly has it all in terms of social commentary. Not to mention the dialogue that punches and sings with each delivery. This show doesn't need to rely on shock value or dramatic twists that have been trending for past shows like Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Last of Us, Arcane. It builds itself on the foundation of character and relationships.",5
"Feels inauthentic","Bad casting, bad acting, bad dialogue, fake scenery.I will continue to watch because I'm a great fan of Edith Wharton and Henry James, oh, and Downton Abbey, which this can't touch. Julian Fellowes is completely out of his depth but can't be blamed for the casting, scenery, and acting.I gave it a 5 star rating. Maybe I will be able to adjust it as this is based on episode 1 alone. I don't have much hope for this effort.",8
"Not great","Not great, but interesting enough. A well done, visually appealing period piece about the richie rich in New York, late 1800s. The daughters from these American families are the women that went to England to marry into the upper crust. That's the only way those elaborate British estates were able to survive as long as they did.",10
"Julian Fellows is a MAESTRO!!!!","EXTRAORDINARY DETAIL! Julian fellows is a Maestro that has harnessed the talent of so many people in every single detail of this series!!!! I can say I'm not surprised, but this series is nothing short of spectacular and more breathtaking in each episode !I'm seriously watching thinking how lucky we are to watch this time in history as if we are right there. The detail is really everything! I watch ALL of the extras after the episode etc. I just can't get enough!!!! BRAVO to the ENTIRE TALENTED CAST AND CREW!!!!",10
"Wonderful series","This is a wonderful series, much better than Bridgerton or Downton Abbey. Well cast, wonderfully acted, amazing costumes, photography and directing. Great plot as well.All in all, a series not to be missed.",8
"A Guilty Pleasure","My wife is typically the one to enjoy historical dramas. But this one is really well done. So nice they were able to film at actual period specific locations, it makes for great scenery.Terrific casting, too. There's no weak link and they've gone to great lengths to make sure each storyline can be supported.Too bad production was slowed by covid. They could be up to season 3 or 4 by now. Good show, highly recommended.",9
"Great show for historic drama lovers","I really like this tv series. Some other commenters seem to be disappointed that it is not an ""American Downton Abbey"", but you really can't expect that, the setting is different, the themes are obviously different, the history era as well. If you want Downton Abbey go watch Downton Abbey.Others mention that it is woke. Really? There is one black side character and one homosexual man. Sorry to break it to you, but in NYC, there lived tens of thousands (if not more) black Americans at that time and you can bet even homosexuals. These themes are not forced on the audience, they are tastefully and with respect to every side incorporated in the plot. I also like that the black character is portrayed in not a classic stereotypical way (black=poor and suffering), that's really refreshing and also factually right). Also, in Downton Abbey there we have a homosexual man too. You didn't mind him there?Others mention dullness or ""wooden"" acting. Well at that time people weren't so overly enthusiasthic about everything like Americans are now. I definitely didn't find the plot dull (I've seen 4 episodes now), though the plots and subplots are developing rather slowly I must admit. But I really don't mind it.I always watch an original HBO podcast on Youtube regarding each particular episode, where historic background is discussed and creators of the show chip in too. It's obvious the tv series is well researched and a lot of effort went into making of the show.",9
"Looking forward to season 2","I really enjoyed the story line, the differing perspectives and character progression, amazing wardrobe, and the amount of whit and charm... looking forward to season 2! Can't wait to see what's in store next!",7
"Gonna give it another Ep then decide..","Sort of liked it..Its a good cast and lovely to see so many Broadway Actors popping up..Though im not sure about some of the dialogue..and im definitely not sure how historically correct it is or is actually meant to be..
Some of the location CGI is a bit suspect.. and everything looks brand spanking new..Hardly any dust or dirt anywhere..But i can live with that..Costumes and interior sets look nice..But It just sort of feels like an episode of Downton.. but some years earlier..I am gonna give it another ep and then decide whether i shall continue watching it.",8
"Julian Fellowes ... Need I say more?","I started following ANYTHING written or starring Julian Fellowes after falling in love with MONARCH OF THE GLEN.The Gilded Age has similar feel to Downton Abbey with the weaving of Upstairs and Downstairs of the Rich in the Mansions of Manhattan. NOT A BAD COMPLIMENT to be compared to Downton.I had NO IDEA there were these Mansions in Manhattan!! After touring the Newport Mansions 3 years ago, the grandeur of how these people lived is quite amazing.Like following your favourite book author, I will continue to watch all things Fellowes.We really get to know each Character in The Gilded Age.I LOVED Mr and Mrs Russell ! Carrie Coon was perfect with her not so subtle ways to get what she wanted. I'm glad that they made Mr Russell a likeable Villain climbing the Money Ladder in NYC.Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon are a fun to watch team of Sisters whose main purpose in life is avoiding scandal for themselves and their niece Marian. Christine is such a fabulous Snob.The Ep 9 Finale really makes us want to see how Peggy's SHOCKING story goes for Season 2 !! I'm sure Marian will be there for her new Friend.Looking forward to Season 2.",10
"Horses for courses, fine for what it is. An unexciting make-do","I wasn't a fan of Downton Abbey, but I could not have been because I never watched it. I did so for about ten minutes and decided it wasn't really my bag. So what am I doing watching The Gilded Age, which is pretty much Downton Abbey in refined Noo York?Well, I don't really know. Rather like Downton (and all soap operas and toffee) there is a certain moreish quality to it so that the impulse to gawk at something else is postponed for just another five minutes for no very good reason that comes to mind. And then the next five minutes. And then . . .As this is produced by HBO, the production values are very high. Acting and direction are OK, dialogue functional, plot uninspired, future plot twists pretty much predicable, so for many folk what is there not to like?Those exquisite sets (and the costumes) are, frankly, just a little too perfect and remind you of nothing else but a very expensive film set. But I should imagine staunch and loyal Downton fans who are only too happy for Downton Rides Again won't object.For a city in which, in the late 1870s/80s everyone who was anyone, i.e. The folk The Gilded Age is about, travelled by horse-drawn hansom cab, conditions are remarkably - I'll stress the 'remarkably' as I am remarking on - clean not to say spotless. Not a hint of horse droppings anywhere.That is surprising because the amount of horse muck in the streets was a prime concern for big cities from London and Paris to, well, New York. They feared the might drown in it.But then Downton folk don't want realism: they want Downton Rides Again. I'll probably carry on watching because my hunt, underway since I finished watching all four seasons of Succession, for the second time for an evening streaming watch has so far proved unproductive. And for what it is, The Gilded Age is fine. For what it is.",6
"Unlikeable characters","I know this drama is of it's age but it is a sad window into a time and place which it would appear was driven by greed and superficial values. It lacks the charm and soul which I feel are a requirement for this genre.",1
"Wasted writing & acting tslents","The first season was interesting. I was hoping for more with the release of the second season, but the first episode was too dry and stilted. The acting was a waste because of the writing. The beginning of Downtown Abbey was the same time period. The parallel ends there. Too many viewers watched DA, and somehow expected the warmth of the families and household staffs, but there was none. The costumes, hair styles and sets are lavish, having filmed in locations from the period. Christine Baranski throws her lines with her great talent for zingers. Cynthia Nixon is miscast as CB's sister. Nathan Lane isn't great as a southerner moneyed character. He's meant to play comedy and is foppish.It's just okay.",9
"High society, new rich and plutocracy","Summary 2The Golden Age is a great fresco, realistic and at times harsh, of New York high society in the last fifth of the 19th century, with a wealthy aristocracy without titles of nobility, but with strict codes of belonging (and exclusion) and linked to a clearly plutocratic political class and the new rich who aspire to be part of it and influence the latter.Review:After losing her father, young Marian Brook (Louisa Jacobson) is taken in by her New York socialite aunts, widowed Agnes van Rhijn (Christine Baranski) and her sister Ada Brook (Cynthia Nixon), and begins to interact with that social environment.The Golden Age is a great fresco of the New York high society of the last fifth of the 19th century, with a wealthy aristocracy without titles of nobility, but with strict codes of belonging (and exclusion) and linked to a clearly plutocratic policy and the nouveaux riches, who aspire to be part of it and influence the second.The Brook aunts are part of the first group, while the new (and very) rich are represented by married couple Bertha and George Russell (Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector) and their two marriageable children. Bertha is obsessed with being accepted by that high society and being part of it, while George (representing modern capitalism in the making) sees it as a target to do business with its members and the government.Marian is a critical observer of both groups as she becomes more involved with them. And she is joined by Peggy Scott (Denée Benton), a young African-American woman who starts working as a secretary for Aunt Agnes and who proposes a career as a writer. This character allows us to introduce a very nuanced and unschematic view of the reality of the group to which she belongs at that time (far from the forced anachronisms of Bridgerton). On the other hand, the series looks at the life of the large servants of the aunts and the Russells. As we can see, The Golden Age is focused above all on a female universe of empowered characters according to the social canons of the time.The co-writer and co-producer of the series is writer Julian Fellowes, who also wrote the screenplays for the Gosford Park movie and the Downton Abbey series. But it is not entirely correct to affirm (as it is done) that The Golden Age is a New York version of the latter, since they clearly differ in their tone and scope: while the British series tends to melodrama and takes place in a generally isolated scenario, the second is clearly more realistic and less indulgent with its characters, takes place in an urban environment and looks decidedly at politics. His look at social conventions and rise and the corruption of the American plutocracy is quite harsh. At the same time, it is interesting to note how certain characters are not necessarily a sampler of all their social prejudices, but instead harbor a surprisingly more modern view of some of them.Among the large and very good cast gathered, all the protagonists must stand out: the sweet and at the same time determined Marian Brook of Louisa Jacobson, the ambitious Bertha Russell of the infallible Carrie Coon, the acid Aunt Agnes of Christine Baranski, the also sweet Aunt Ada by Cynthia Nixon, the sober and implacable George Russell by Morgan Spector and the personal Peggy Scott by Denée Benton.As expected, the period reconstruction is remarkable and the production display is lavish and certain dialogues are collectible. Some characters live in real palaces and the women wear huge hats and inconceivable dresses, with tons of fabric.",8
"Charming and visually stunning","I wasn't sure I was going to like this, I've never been into period dramas, but I really enjoyed the first season. It's a visually spectacular, well-written take on New York in the 1880s. Very much focused on society, and it can be superficial at times, but it has a genuinely good heart and intriguing characters that you really root for. It made me decide to watch Downton Abbey.",9
"Slow burner","Started really quite slowly but it gradually grew on me and I found myself involved with many characters...now fully immersed and looking forward to more.",8
"Despite everything, I gotta admit, I enjoyed the first 2 episodes","The show has many flaws, indeed. Many actors are not great at all and they lack depth. The writing script is poor and not well-thought as well. But I still found it entertaining in its shallowness childishness. So yeah, 8 it is.",9
"Downtown Abbey American","A masterpiece after Downton Abbey , American version of the most prosperous society ever , seen in great detail by the amazing producer and Writer Julian Fellowes.",10
"Enjoyable watch","I really enjoyed watching this. The acting was great with believable characters and good storylines. I found it a comfort to watch in difficult times.",6
"Upstairs, Downstairs and Downton Abbey, a cast of 1000s ... plus the kitchen sink","Two episodes so early days yet but...There have been entirely too many characters introduced at this point and I expect more to come. Love the casting of Christine Baranski (always watchable), Cynthia Nixon (excellent), Denee' Benton (talented and charismatic) and Harry Richardson (relatively unknown to US audiences but very appealing in this role). Also, the costumes and architecture, the introduction of such historical figures as Stanford White, the Astors, etc. Are refreshing.However, the mediocre performance of a very pretty young actress in a key role was so jarring, it led me to look up her previous (very light) experience. Now I like an iconic and gifted actor as much or more than the next person but that the gift has been passed down to the next generation is is not yet evident in this case. But it does explain the casting decision.Will be happy to update if additional episodes prove me wrong.",10
"Lavish, lush and lingering...","Having watched the finale (don't worry, there will be no spoilers here) I found myself wanting more, watching all the while not wondering when it would end but hoping it wouldn't. This viewing experience has been consistent throughout the entire season. The sets, costumes, dialogue,... all of it is sumptuous and luxurious in all the right ways. Take the creators of Downton Abbey and add some of the best ingredients of The Good Fight, the finest Meryl Streep has to offer (I'm sure she would agree) and the result is not gilded but golden entertainment.",7
"Old Money vs New Money","This show has a good way of expressing the livelihood of the wealthy, rich elite from NYC a century ago. The Russells is a nice touch of big new money making a splash. Ms. Brook nice character to play neutral, open-minded niece to Ms. Van Rhijn old money. Has potential, shows need some time to really seize their identity. Hope the show just evolves slightly obviously as time passes but I would give S-2 a shot if Season 1 ends well.",5
"I'm Trying...","...To give this a chance. The first episode wasn't too bad, but it's getting hard to swallow after the second. As much as I ADORE period pieces, this comes across as too fake/stagey. Absolutely everything is immaculately clean, even the streets. A middle schooler could tell you how filthy the times were. Even the exterior of the ""old"" homes look like a Sesame Street set. It's disappointing that the main character lacks the necessary charm or believability required to carry the story (are we sure she's Meryl Streep's daughter?!) and it seems the show's intent was to deliver painfully wooden and anachronistic dialogue by all actors (good or otherwise). I'm honestly exhausted by the incessant conversations revolving around social status (and how things are changing!), the boring plot around the robber baron, and the bickering attitude from the main girl. Most characters are unlikable and their dramatic motives remain mysterious (I have to assume we'll eventually start learning why these people are hideous). It seems we are to sympathize with the greedy Russell's, which I most certainly do not. And while I normally like Carrie Coon, she's too heavy handed in this. In fact, many actors seem a bit miscast. (Can we PLEASE bring back the Downton Abbey serving staff?! This group is terrible). Thankfully, Baranski naturally steals her scenes and evokes a beloved Maggie Smith. For a satisfying period piece, watch ""The Age of Innocence""... I plan to in the hopes of erasing this attempt from memory.",8
"Wonderful Show","Season 1 - July 11, 202210 ⭐sI loved it! It has been a long time since I enjoyed myself this much watching a TV show. The Gilded Aged might not be historically accurate but it was amazing. The costumes were to die for. The cast was incredible-well except for Maryl Streep's daughter, she was the weakest link in the casting, honestly, I don't understand why they keep insisting on her daughters they are all mediocre. I can't wait for season 2.",8
"Not just a Downton-rehash","I have to admit that the first episode left me wondering if this was just Downton Abbey swept away from England and dumped in New York circa 1880. The whole upstairs/downstairs dynamic and the trivialities of upper class life almost made it seem like they tried to copy everything from Downton to the letter.But furtheron, the story takes off and stands in its own right. The actors are enigmatic to a fault, and the scenery and backdrop-elements are wonderful. Its a really good show for anyone with a fondness for historical dramas. I really have my fingers crossed for another season to follow .",9
"Beautiful and entertaining","I hated Downton Abbey, but I love this! It's less twee. Maybe due to the fact that it's set in America and I can suspend disbelief more easily because it's not my home country.I reckon some of the bad reviewers didn't watch more episodes than a certain passionate kiss and the topless lady in the next episode, but it seems that after those 2 episodes they decided to be less risqué and if you give it a chance you will like it... or maybe some of the negative reviewers are sympathisers with Mrs Van Rijn's maid...My only criticism is that some of the scenes look like cut scenes from Railway Tycoon games. How hard would it be to film a real train? They do exists. I get why Startrek uses CGI, but it's a bit much for a period piece. The colour saturation is very strange too. Heightened reds and blues. I watched it on a couple of different devices because I thought it was my screen, but no it's an editing choice.I'm keen for season 3 which I hear has been given the go-ahead.",10
"Rough start, but so good now!","I really love this show. The first season was a bit bumpy. I think there were some complexities of some of the characters they were trying to point out that would be there more subtly later on adding an interesting layer to the storyline. I usually go back and rewatch early episodes once I'm attached to characters later in series and usually find them to be better. Not so in this case, they were still a bit rocky. But that said, this show is very much worth watching, especially if you enjoyed Dowton or watching an exquisite cast doing an amazing job.The scenery and costumes will draw you in to another time.",9
"Historical ""porn"" at its best","Imagine if Henry James wrote for the adult film industry. That's ""The Gilded Age.""Or, imagine if Julian Fellowes pitched a miniseries to the company formerly known as HBO. (It's sex in the city but in the gay 90s....?)Come for t h e excruciating dialogue; stay for t h e clunky social messaging. It's the spoonful of sugar that yada yada. (Even these actors can't make it sound like these lines didn't devolve from some steampunkromance chatgpt.)Yet. Soap opera has never been so sumptuous. Camp has never been so fin d'siecle. Up/downstairs has never been more dreamily reinterpreted for an ""american"" audience. PBS who?",8
"Well Written","No this is not a clone of Downton Abbey. Why would it be when it is a different country and different culture and different time period? It is a well portrayed story about the newly wealthy wanting to enter New York society and being met with resistance. I found no character in this that is supposed to be Violet. There are several strong minded opinionated women in this, but none of them are similar to Violet. Nor were they intended to be. Nor is the music is the same as Downton Abbey music as one person complained. Nothing like it at all. Nor is it ""woke"" because one of the main characters is a young Black woman. Yes she faced prejudice as any Black person would have in that time period, but that was not the focus of her story. Nor was Mrs. Russell like Alva Vanderbilt. This woman actually loved her daughter and saw her as more than a possession and a rung to climb in society as I have read about Alva Vanderbilt. Alva Vanderbilt wanted no less an English Duke for her daughter and she got one even though her daughter had been in love with an American man with a good reputation in New York Society. Mrs. Russell only wanted someone for her daughter who was more than a fortune hunter, although, yes, she did want her to marry well. Although Mrs. Russell could be fooled by a fortune hunter thinking he was more than that because of his high position in New York society; her husband is not weak, the way Alva's was. He is very savvy, he would never allow their daughter to be forced into an unhappy marriage. Plus, there was no indication Mrs. Russell wanted her daughter to enter English society. If people watched more than the first three episodes where the story was being set up, they would have realized that.",6
"Amazing","This was such an amazing show, and I can't wait for season 2! The characters were interesting and I even enjoyed watching the 'bad people' and their scenes. Definitely a recommendation!",10
"A disappointment","After lovable Downton Abbey carachters these Guilded Age types seem quite uninteresting and not very likeable. I also wonder the Disney style wardrobe of all women. Was it really like that in US in the end of the 19th century? It may be that after the first season I'll have to try to find another perod dama to follow. Pity, that there are only a few of them.",6
"Another Gem from Julian Fellows","I waited until the season was done before offering my rating. Not since the early seasons of 'Upstairs, Downstairs' have I enjoyed such a lavish example of days gone by. Just enough fiction with the facts of the times to keep things moving. Now that we have them all a season rewatch is in order. This gap until season 2 shows up would be great time for the 2nd half of 'The Nevers'.",2
"Disappointing compared to Downton Abbey","The acting, writing, and costuming are dramatically below DA. The costuming is almost comedic, to the point where it makes the characters unbelievable. The two aunts are the only actresses of significant notoriety, and they are not remotely keeping up with their salary. I would not go with a 3, like the last reviewer, but the average rating of 8 is not believable.",10
"Slow, Tired & Dreary Plus Terrible Acting by One","The 1st episode was filled with gorgeous costumes, beautiful sets and terrible acting. Not terrible acting by all but I'm confused by the choice of Carrie Coon and I'm not sure what is happening there, it's like watching my son play the tuba at his first school recital. Cringe worthy but I love him and he was 10 years old. There is not so much to forgive while watching scene after scene of Coon swooshing her skirt to and fro while she uses her best Elizabeth Holmes (Theranos founder) voice impersonation to deliver a high school level summer-theater performance. Cynthia Nixon, Christine Baranski, and Denée Benton are fantastic. As for the rollout of episode 2 tonight I can only hope The performances get better as we move forward.",6
"What You'd Expect From Julian Fellowes","All Julian Fellows TV series have a similarity, but I expect it and I like it! Per usual, there is a lot of attention to detail; and nothing feels unauthentic to the period. While the plot is simple, the dialogue and character moments make each episode utterly enjoyable.",9
"Love it","We just started watching the series and are really enjoying it. Only four left and I'm already dreading the end. Is this a one time show or will it be back? We loved Downton and hope that this is the next new series we can count on for awhile.",9
"Loved it thoroughly, waiting for season 2","What a splendid show! Enjoyed the witty dialogue, old vs new rivalry, nuanced writing and great acting at display. Weakness for period fashion caused me to pause and admire the costumes quite frequently.Despite their obvious flaws the Russell couple are a delight and you end up rooting for them. Similarly in spite of her obvious snob, Aunt Agnes is likeable and makes us relate with her somehow.After their cold nod to each other at the ball, stage is set for Mrs Russell and aunt Agnes to interact /clash next season.",10
"Horribly Downton Abbeyish","This is Downton Abbey all over again. The music, the big house, the kitchen, the butler, EVERYTHING.I was so disappointed in this.Why would I want to eat an old reheated dish?",9
"Gilded Excellence - S01 Review","Set in New York in the 1800s, there was so much (and then some) to admire and appreciate in ""The Gilded Age"". It was an interesting season one, rife with 'underdog story' elements.Plenty of politics, power play, 'old money, new money' themes, racial discrimination (post-Emancipation), and fortune-focused matchmaking were written aptly into the script. More than a few characters were earnestly contending to make their mark in America's 'gilded age' of industry and progress, adding to the immersive quality of this series.Directors Michael Engler and Salli Richardson-Whitfield did exceptional work bringing this era to life. It was written superbly by Sonja Warfield and Julian Fellowes (also show creator) - such seamless pacing, such diligent detailing.Harry Gregson-Williams and Rupert Gregson-Williams' musical scoring was stunning, especially in the way they managed to capture the feel and flair of the times.Lula Carvalho, Manuel Billeter, and Vanja Cernjul's cinematography had such a sharp eye for detail that one could get easily lost in this world. Great work all round by those who worked on editing, sound effects, and art direction.Special shout-out to the production design, set decoration, and hair-makeup crews, who did brilliant painstaking work on ""The Gilded Age"". Kasia Walicka-Maimone's costume design deserves more than mere appreciation, it was well and truly award-worthy.Being a huge fan of Meryl Streep, I cannot broach the topic of cast without first remarking on Louisa Jacobson's performance as Marian Brook. She is truly her mother's daughter. Her nuanced and subtle approach made me feel as though I was watching one of Meryl's early movies. Watching Louisa was equal parts nostalgic and captivating.Ada Brook, played by Cynthia Nixon, was amazing - she never disappoints. Agnes Van Rhijn, played by Christine Baranski, was stellar - she has an enviable tendency to steal the spotlight. Bertha Russell, played by Carrie Coon, was outstanding.Jack Treacher, played by Ben Ahlers, was quite good. George Russell, played by Morgan Spector, was great. Larry Russell, played by Harry Richardson, was quite good. Gladys Russell, played by Taissa Farmiga, was notable. Oscar Van Rhijn, played by Blake Ritson was amazing. Tom Raikes, played by Thomas Cocquerel, was good. Peggy Scott, played by Denée Benton, was great.Turner, played by Kelley Curran, was remarkable. Mamie Fish, played by Ashlie Atkinson, was memorable. Dorothy Scott, played by Audra McDonald, was quite good. Arthur Scott, played by John Douglas Thompson, was good. Watson, played by Michael Cerveris, was intriguing. Church, played by Jack Gilpin, was notable. Baudin, played by Douglas Sills, was memorable. Ward McAllister, played by Nathan Lane, was an astoundingly amazing surprise.All other cast and crew did notable work in ""The Gilded Age"".HBO's ""The Gilded Age"", also streaming on Hulu, was a revelation in more ways than one. It captured nuanced performances, displayed ornate era-centric costumes, settings, and sundry paraphernalia, and portrayed various shades of human nature.Season 1 ""The Gilded Age"" was supremely entertaining and engaging. The scripting was opulent, and the performances were spectacular. I'm sure it will appeal not only to fans of period-piece storytelling but to most viewers who like detailed character-driven plots.Being an impassioned fan of ""Downton Abbey"", I must regardless admit that the brilliant series has found a worthy contender to its crown in this one. ""The Gilded Age"" Season 2, where are you?",10
"Great Storyline, Cast & Overall Show!","My wife and I truly enjoy this show. The storyline builds & keeps us coming back! Mrs. Russell's obsession with being accepted as part of the upper echelon of society, is bothersome, but her tenacity keeps her character exciting. We are looking fwd to season 2!",10
"Downton in NYC!","I'm a huge Downton Abbey fan and I miss it so. This is such a treat! It's totally Downton, but it stands out on its own, but takes place in America and at an even earlier era. Great acting all around and I love the story lines, sets and costumes. I simply love it!",7
"Irritated by Issues with the Costumes. Otherwise...","The bodices of many of the women's costumes have construction issues-at first I thought one of the actresses had lost a breast to breast cancer, then realized it was just bad bodice construction and many of the other actresses' costumes had the same issues! If it weren't for that distraction, I'd have given it 8 stars.The cast is great, most of the scenes are shot beautifully-a couple of the outdoor street scenes seem to have been rushed, or maybe they didn't notice the lighting issues-the sets are incredible, and the costumes, and hair and make-up are well done... with the exception of the construction issues.However, I only noticed these issues in the third episode, I'm quite enjoying it and I usually don't enjoy American period pieces as much as I do this one. It makes sense, as it's Julian Fellowes, but it's also the great cast who seem to have meshed really well... Here's hoping for a Season Two!",8
"Good old New York...","...as we know it today! It seems nothing has changed except it was honest, raw and direct back then!The lavishness is reminiscent of France as is the weather! New York climate is notoriously extreme - if they could at least have included one day of cold weather perhaps, it would be more realistic and not feel like a set! But despite that, brilliant to watch regardless...",6
"Sound mixer needs a hearing test","I like this show but I am increasingly frustrated by the sound. The background hussle and bustle is important, yes, but not at the expense of dialog. Even the musical score tends to drown out the actors. I found that I kept nudging up the volume only to discover it made matters worse. The rewind button is needed regularly to figure out what is being said.Someone should fire the sound guy, but he probably wouldn't hear you.The outdoor sets are impressive but as must only have a few as they get used and reused over and over. I know these production cost are prohibitive but good CG now is pretty hard to spot.",1
"very bad, bad in extreme levels","HBO is getting poor, every day is a new generic series and BAD plot and writing are as shallow as a tea saucer hammy performances evident anachronism American ""royalty"" has nothing to do with British royalty! It doesn't have the same charm, it doesn't have the same glamour, it doesn't have the same opulence it's just a BAD series with an HBO seal.",9
"Can't wait for season 2","The first episode was iffy but I really wanted to love the show since the time period is so interesting to me so I watched the second and was hooked. The characters are so well developed and the acting is fantastic. I loved the main plot and how all the subplots began to weave together. I do wish they had dedicated more time to some of those... especially to a couple of them that seemed forgotten. Maybe they will play out in season two??? I hope so. Carrie Coon as Bertha Russell is a delight to watch ... a character I both despised and rooted for at the same time. I can't wait for season two!",8
"A little bit of history with a lot of drama!","I like it! It definitely is NOT another Downton Abbey, which is where (I think) a lot of negative reviews came from. It is on HBO as opposed to PBS, which adds some controversial scenes. The costumes and scenery are meticulously marvelous and immediately enticing. The highlighted historical accents (e.g.-the hand and torch of the Statue of Liberty in Madison Square Park) and other little nuggets of the like, immediately drew me in. Of course it's not all factual, but is loosely based on a devoted family man/financier and the wealthy clique of ""old money"" who does not like the idea of modification and the changes it brings. It is a tad soapy, but that's what makes it fun! I'm not trying to change your mind if you've seen one or two episodes and have decided it's not for you, but I feel that any film production should be given a chance (based upon the subject and viewer interests) and decide whether it's worthwhile to them. As for me, I am extremely excited and anticipating the next season!!",8
"Good story line, but the acting....","It is honestly the worst acting that I have ever seen. Where was the director to have some of these people say their lines over again. Out local community theatre could do better.Having said that the story line is okay. You have to suspend disbelief on most stories, and this one is no exception.Would recommend with caution.",8
"Very enjoyable. Just stop comparing to Downton Abbey.","This is a very enjoyable, soap-opera-like drama about the anachronistic ways of different social classes (new money X old money X their service entourage, etc) in NY at the end of the 19th century. It's much more ""Hollywood"" than Downton Abbey, meaning the writing and acting is less refined, but also the pace is fasted and it can be quite fun. I would just take it as the fun story is it, because there are enough twists and turns to keep you immersed until the last chapter. I can't wait for Season 2!",8
"Good show, def worth a watch.","It's funny how this show, which is constantly compaired to Downton Abbey, reflects the difference between upper class in the US and the UK. The tiltle is a perfect metaphore; it's gilded, not golden.",9
"Super fun but not Downton Abbey","Why don't the actors have inflection in their delivery? Downton was better in this respect. Comedic lines landed so much better. It's so hard to see these people
as three dimensional characters. But the scenery and historical references are impressive. 9/10 because you should watch this beautiful series. Deduct 1
Because I don't care about anyone other than Peggy, Oscar and Gladys.",7
"Better than I initially thought","After much anticipation, after the first episode, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it but happily I have.I immediately recognized Bertha's story as a retelling of the Alva Vanderbilt bid to break into NY society and it turned out to be fun to see it in the flesh after reading about it for so long.I'm hoping very much that Julian Fellowes won't parallel her daughter Consuelo's story but it seems to be going that way. I've always had a soft spot for Consuelo Vanderbilt.Marion's story is basically Sense & Sensibility with Mr Raikes being Willoughby but I can forgive that. Meryl Streep's youngest is fabulous as Marion and I love her loyalty to her father. I hope in the end he will be shown to not be the villain.The below stairs stories have good old Downton intrigue and though not quite as compelling, still great to watch.The gem is Miss Scott's story however. This is a side of NY I've never seen and I have completely enjoyed it!",9
"Great Family Drama","In a world with gratuitous violence, sex, and profanity, this show is refreshing. Something you can watch with the family, with some intrigue and great writing. The characters are well written and clever. I love the balance of Aunt Ada and Aunt Agnes with the bright eyed idealistic Marian. Peggy Scott's storyline is really unique. I'm a huge fan of George Russell and Bertha is strong, willful and resilient in a grand fantastic way. The Russell children are easy to like and even Oscar, while a
Gold digger, pragmatic antagonist, elicits compassion in his desire to survive in a culture that wouldn't accept who he really is.I love the ""downstairs"" characters who are stacked full of Broadway actors that add dimension and grandiose to this fantastic cast.I cannot wait for season 2.",6
"A nice enough depiction that lacks some substance","Be warned, for I have a lot of thoughts on this production, and I like to write long - this won't end up short!These opinions are based on the first season alone.The Gilded Age show is all watchable but not that remarkable - it's a very traditional period drama in a lot of ways. For sure the show's worth more than one star for the production design alone, and depicting the high society of the time quite meticulously.The series could hardly be called soapy, but it's not really a drama either. There's no crazy debauchery, murder or big emotion going on. Just some mostly subtle scheming here and there.If anything, the show could benefit from more drama and twists for season 2, as there's very little emotional payoff yet for any of the characters.Almost nothing happens in the first 7 or 8 episodes out of the 9 - feels like as we're entering the second season, the show has just been set up to start. It feels like at this pace, Fellowes is aiming to write this into a very long multi-season show.They certainly could have moved on with the plotlines much faster, and give us more background information on the characters. 9 episodes in, we know almost nothing about where the Russel family came from, who was Marian's mother, etc. It's not suspenseful to wait for all the grounding information about the characters.The pacing is good enough for the show to not get completely boring though, despite the lack of events. Occassionally, some scenes and characterizations are hilarious and those are definitely the saving moments of the show.The cast is doing their best with the material they're given, and while not bad, it just isn't quite as much as you'd like to see.My main issue with the show is that the cast is just enormous for one short season.Most of the billion downstairs character in the two main houses feel completely unnesseccary for the story. You might remember their names, if you're lucky enough. If the show ended here, you'd feel extremely confused about why each servant got a 30-second mini plot that told us nothing about their character, nor moved the plot forward.Christine Baranski as the melancholic, sarcastic matriarch Agnes van Rhijn could easily be the star of the show - if only she just got a story of her own. Agnes' character, while almost never leaving her dimly-lit, quiet house, is written with much more nuance and humour than most of the other characters. She's very likable despite being an overly controlling person.Cynthia Nixon as her quirky spinster sister Ada delivers a strong character with certain surprise twist to her as well - however, both of them have to share all of their scenes with Marian, one of the most boring main heroines ever written.Marian unfortunately often feels like the weakest link in the show, and has a lot more screentime than any other character, save maybe Bertha.I am not sure whether to blame the writing, the directing, or casting an almost unexperienced actor for the lead, but Marian's presence makes things often much more painful to watch than they should be. She's there to ask questions, deliver an occassional message, and have an uninteresting and predictable 'love' story - and that's pretty much it, and Louisa Rosso always comes across as a bit timid, and somewhat modern in her line delivery. Fellowes and his writing team have quite a task at leveling up Marian's character for the following season(s).Denee Benton as Peggy Scott performs a much more interesting character, and is outstanding at it - even If she barely has any scenes without Marian by her side. A working, upper middle class black woman, who is understately intelligent and charming, is just the breeze of fresh air this show needed.Carrie Coon is quite solid as the overly ambitious, bordering on awful, but still entirely root-able Bertha Russel. Though I felt like after 9 episodes, we didn't quite get to see as much dimension of the character as there could've been. Morgan Spector as George Russel is a ruthless robber baron and a loving husband to Bertha, and delivers both sides pretty well - just wishing there will be some third side to him in the future, even if just a little quirk.The other characters who are apparently also part of the ensemble are pretty much all nicely played, but so fsru, lack proper stories. Nathan Lane is hilarious as the jolly socialite Ward McAllister. Kelli O'Hara as Aurora Fane is understated and charming and seems to be aware of how to play a character fit for the period, the same can be said Donna Murphy and Amy Forsyth as the posh Astors. It'll be exciting to see where Carrie Astor's and Bertha's relationship goes in the following season.Audra MacDonald is fantastic in her 3 or so scenes with Peggy and her father, watching them makes you wish the show was more about them than anyone else.Blake Ritson somehow makes Oscar van Rhijn entertaining to watch, though so far, he's probably the most disappointing depiction of a gay man of the era. There's a lot of things Fellowes could explore there as well, as Oscar technically has the most drama-worthy life out of the charaters. But so far he's just a one-dimensional villain on a hunt for the wealth of the young Gladys Russel, who is maybe gradually developing a personality of her own - unlike her brother Larry.The costumes are a spectacle - the main cast almost never repeats an outfit, and every single outfit tells a clear story of their own. Some of them stunning, some of them tacky, mostly they're both at the same time - especially on Bertha, who's wardrobe is more on the anarchronistic side. Many of the costumes that might seem cookie cutter crazy at first, are actually ones that are almost exact replicas of museum pieces of the time, and it's very exciting to see this period in fashion depicted this vividly.Likewise, the different houses have a distinct look and feel to them and it's a lot of fun. You can instantly tell which one is a new money home from the old. The Russel house rings over the top, elegant but hollow, brand new and fake, and it seems like that's exactly what they were going for - if you compare that to Mrs. Chamberlain's residence, which sports a similar style (and some very trend-setting choices of art) but much more refinement.The hairstyling, and some of the make up could definitely be slightly more enchanced and more period accurate. I'm one who's all for subtle liberties in period accuracy and not modernizing things too much, unless it's a complete fantasy retelling of an era.Upper class women of the time didn't wear noticable makeup, and while it's definitely not the worst I've seen, it's annoying to see the actors with visible lipliner and eyebrow pencil. There's plenty of examples in the genre where actors don't wear any visible makeup and still look beautiful. The hairstyles on The Gilded Age kind of all over the place, and lack some of the elaborateness you see in paintings and fashion plates from the 1880's. For example, Taissa Farmiga as Gladys Russel looks rather like a frizzy poodle - but they did succeed at making her look very young. Louisa Jacobson as Marian Brook is styled too modern in a lot of ways, and her costumes, while cute, don't seem to fit in with the same year with everyone else. Some of the other characters like Aurora, Agnes and Ada tend to look more period-accurate.The usually dashing Blake Ritson is styled in a Snidely Whiplash disguise, which is rather distracting. There's some standout costuming on him though - the rest of the men are styled better, though their outfits don't reflect a lot of individuality - which I suppose works with the theme that the world depicted in the show is all about the ladies. The men are more of a decoration in the ladies' social schenanigans (or something rather villainious).The use of CGI is quite evident in certain scenes, which doesn't really bother me. But at times, there's something lackluster about the use of lighting and camera angles that doesn't always showcase the beautiful design the best it could. The show almost entirely takes place on one short street, which feels a very staged and awkward at times. Some of that is probably contributed to being filmed in the middle of the pandemic restrictions so I'd imagine they'll get to explore more places in the future.Overall, I'd recommend this show if you're into historical series to begin with, and don't mind a slowly burning story. Like said, a lot of this felt like tablesetting for season 2, so I'll keep my hopes up for a better season.",3
"This is HBO?","As with everyone else, Julian Fellowes was the draw, as well as a few well known faces that are known to be great actors. Something in this production got its wires crossed though. Did anyone tell these actors they are in a tv series and not a stage play? Not just them, but the writers, set dec, wardrobe, lighting, and director? It really has a stagey feel. The casting director really messed this up. Cynthia Nixon came out of left field. She does not fit in this at all. It seems that none of Meryl Streep's daughters inherited her acting abilities either, because the lead girl is not bringing it. The writing is throwing her character under the bus by introducing her as an innocent young lady but all of the sudden she's taking New York City by storm? Not buying it.The costumes and sets are colorful but they definitely look like costumes. And wigs and horribly dyed hair. No one is memorable to look at and look washed out. Like an ensemble in a play, not individual characters. Don't get me started on the very fake sets.Honestly, none of this would have been as noticeable (or it would at least be more forgivable) if the actors didn't seem like overacting robots. What is with the cadence of the dialogue? It's completely unnatural and somehow flat while being too boisterous for the screen.I am still watching though. I'm going to keep giving it a go because sometimes it can take a while to get in a groove. But this is 100% not HBO quality viewing. Where was the budget spent?",9
"Episode Nine!!!","I had my doubts about this series in the beginning. To call it a slow start would be an understatement. But, the series grew on me and episode 9 was brilliant through and through! I will certainly forward to next season and it's intrigues.",9
"Intriguing and great for Downton lovers","Great show just hope they keep it decent and family friendly. One episode had nudity which made us nervous but the rest of the series is intriguing and mostly family friendly.Definitely worth checking out for anyone who loved downton abbey since it follows families/households with very similar lifestyles.The story line is fairly original and extremely interesting. I find myself looking forward to the next episode right away and kinda wish I found this after the series was completed so I could binge it.Most of what people are calling ""unoriginal"" are just basics to the lifestyle of the period and, in my opinion, can't be helped when making series like this. There will always be some similarities but that's what makes the genre!",10
"New York period drama with lots of historical content.","The amount of work and research that went into making this series is outstanding. The costumes, set design, the locations and the incredible cast. Also the podcast that accompanies each episode explains so much and great interviews with the cast and crew. Now I need to rewatch it again to notice all the details I missed. What a great show.",9
"Old money, new money. Amazing. Can't wait for more","Oh that Old New York, how I wish I could go back in time or be born in those Gilded Years where a Vacation home would cost 200k.Beautiful period show, all from costumes to storyline, characters.What I truly love about this period drama is that in time of difficult relationships, reality, there is a beautiful series where the rich live a righteous life. They treat people by respect, give and take what is deserved, law and order or shall we say Karma is served right in time.Its not dry, its not boring. Its very witty, playful. Everything that a show needs.I love Russel's marriage, their loyalty, support for one another.",9
"A wonderful series that keeps getting better.","Julian Fellowes is the creator and writer of The Gilded Age, Gosford Park, Downton Abbey, Belgravia and more, each one outstanding. But Fellowes set all those series in Britain as he's British. I wondered if he could successfully write a series about the US while not being American. We may share the same language, but there are so are so many cultural gulfs and cliffs that have to be overcome. Fellowes pulled it off, I enjoyed Season 1 and just completed Season 2 and I can't wait for Season 3.The success of The Gilded Age is because of the great writing and the great casting. Fellowes and his fellow writers and researchers have captured that late 19th Century era in the US with it's unbridled capitalism that wasn't a golden era but a gilded one. While focused on New York City's budding war between old money and new money, it also gave a glimpse into the black community. However the series should also give a small glimpse of other minority communities during that period, for example German, Italian, Jewish, and Irish immigrants and more. It's difficult to find a cast member that hasn't gone to drama school and it's reflected in the high quality of the acting. From Jack Treacher and Mrs. Bauer to Church and Mrs. Bruce and of course George and Bertha Russell and Agnes and Oscar van Rhijn, they are all drama school graduates. The cast is composed of American, British and Australian actors who use American and US regional accents.Fellowes partner in this series and others productions has been Gareth Neame as executive producer. Neame comes from film royalty, his grandfather Ronald Neame directed one of the greatest films ever made, ""Tunes of Glory"".Hope HBO keeps producing more seasons.",8
"Very Watchable","Ok we all agree, it's no Downton Abbey, the characters aren't half as sympathetic, in fact most are either unlikeable or uninteresting. Also some of the characters are just plain annoying. The downstairs staff of both neighboring houses are poorly drawn, maybe they will be more fully developed in subsequent episodes, after all we see only 2 seasons. But overall the series is engaging and watchable, the interiors and costumes beautiful. The thing is that the theme of old money vs new money, really doesn't ring true; yes there are old NY families who disdain the New Money gleaned from industries but face it all of these characters are new money compared to the British aristocracy. Also this theme is explored in books so much better -- such as Edith Wharton's books. Here its depiction is pretty superficial, exemplified mainly by the contrasting clothes and interiors. Still, like I said, watchable.As to casting, I thought in general it was good, except for Marion Brook, she's supposed to be 16 or 17 at the beginning, but looks 30 throughout. Another question -- were bangs as part of the hairdos a regular thing back in 1880? Because they look fake and out of place especially on the Agnes character.",8
"Super costumes, lack of consistent plot and story","Loved Downton Abbey and Mary carried out the entire series successfully. That is not the case here, as Louise Jacobson is cute as a button and beautiful but it doesn't have main character air. There are multiple plots and story lines and still none of them carries out the series. I feel like watching a development of period costumes and decor and random people talking random daily problems from that era. I am still watching it as I love period dramas but don't think it can carry a third season, only if they change something dramatically.Christine Baransky is great but not he greatest role, and the same goes with Cynthia Nixon.Loved watching Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector in their Russel familly roles and I think they can become easily some main characters in the series.",7
"Great start","I'm really enjoying this series even though it took several episodes to get into it.The costumes are amazing with a well rounded cast.I love going back after watching each episode to what is real and to see which characters might be based on a real person.Looking forward to season 2!",8
"Loved some things hated others","Okay so I had this marked on.my calendar for me and my mother in her 50s to watch and it started out well enough a little too talky but okay then it picked up I loved the friendship of the black girl and white girl it was absolutely beautiful to see especially now days but then at the tale end came the lgbtq ill admit im.no prude and I am okay with it on most programs but this was promised to be the next downtown Abby and that show went on without having to do this im. Sorry if I come off as rude but now my mother won't watch because of this incident but show wise it was pretty okay.",6
"Disappointing","What was this? What's up with the accents, good grief some are more British than the Brits. I found it all very Anne of Green Gables/Mills and Boonish. I'm not sure if it's trying too hard, but it's not a patch on Downton so far. Lets hope the second episode improves, Christine Baranski is great as usual, but Cynthia Nixon is a nix. (sorry a bit of AJLT anti-bias creeping in, I think that show has forever tarnished her) The ""upper class"" men in general are awful and the whole thing just doesn't feel real, more like a stage production.",2
"Such A Gem!","I absolutely loved the first season of this well scripted series. The characters are all so special in their own ways. They pull you right into their world and make you want to be there with them. I had no idea where season two would take us but I was excited nevertheless. Then season two brought us so much more depth. The real hard and sometimes scary topics they showed were so well done. This is definitely a great historical series with brilliant talent. I can't get enough of this show. I am already so yearning for season three. I only just finished it as I choose to stream the whole season back to back: cheers to the whole cast and everyone who makes this show possible. It's such an enjoyable and special experience each and every episode.",10
"A return to form","After one too many seasons of a brocade of scarcely enjoyable and critically appreciated series, HBO brings a second season that's just as wholesome, thoughtful, and specially as great as the first, if not more. There are many positive things I could share as to why this beloved series is so dear to every fan whose been lucky enough to follow it since it's inception on Sunday night television, but to the many who does presently love and cherish this history inspired semi fictional story, or the many who will to be added (I truly feel this is one of those cases, such as in aging wine, where with time this story will only become more and more endearing) to this fan club. There is one aspect I can't praise any more and that is the casting; amongst an slightly eclectic cast of veterans, some newcomers, but altogether a myriad of talent filled ensemble, where is noticeable a love for this story in particular, transpires through their almost every performance, it's the original casting that has stood out significantly, to me at least. I have to confess, casting, unless I'm discussing a Wes or P. T. Anderson flick (at the risk of sounding snobbish A. F.) it's not a film's segment that either professional or amateur fans of a particular movie, in my experience, is neither praised or covered enough. Since this is a story that's told in a series of episodes, there's ample chance to realize to what extent a casting director as done his or her job well, and for the first time I can say that, to me, not a single role hasn't been filed to almost perfection. I must say that is a first to me, the two aforementioned auteurs notwithstanding, that I can say with total certainty that I feel every single one of those roles have been performed as artfully and humanly possible. Now, I can't praise enough the work that has gone into those roles by the director, the rest of the cast, and the actors and actresses themselves, because well, I really can't. ""The gilded age"" has indeed become a memorable phrase, a timeless historic chapter in this country's history, and now, a resounding and unforgettable work of art.",9
"Not quite Downton Abby","I was excited to see this show was written by the same people that did Downton Abbey. The issue with this show is that the settings seem very staged and not natural the cinematography is at Angles to always show the same view of things, like the street where these high society families live is very constructive. The acting is probably the worst part for me. Cynthia Nixon is absolutely horrible I don't know how she was cast in this role but every line she delivers seems like a rehearsal. Many of the conversations throughout the show do not flow very well there seems to be a stiffness to the acting and a natural quality that is missing in many scenes. Also it feels to me like with recent improvements in this country when it comes to race relations they have tried to include this in a historic period piece and it's just not believable. They have touched a little bit on how people of color suffered from being discriminated against but it is very very watered-down and I truly believe that back in those days the Discrimination was much more severe than it is being portrayed. I'm glad that we have advanced as a country but we still have a lot of work to do when it comes to equality for all.",6
"The great american dream","Julian Fellows artfully describes the upstairs and downstairs of the industrial era in New York's emerging upper class. Beautiful costumes somewhat a predictable plot with good actors stunning visuals.",7
"Empty and plain","Nope! Tried really hard to like it but found nothing to rescue! Not one likeable character, all vapid and superficial. Storylines are quickies, no meat or depth! And the costumes...horrible and gaudy! They look like cheap birthday cakes! The script is flat and boring. Nobody to root for, the Jacobson girl just a plain Jane...what a waste! I'm giving it a four rate because I feel sorry for the cast and crew!",4
"Yawn...","The costumes, sets and cinematogrophy are exquisite! But that's all there is to it...Yes, I have watched two seasons even though the series is rather boring, slow, and superficial.There never seems to be a storyline that really twists or builds.With the star studded cast I expected something more nuanced and compelling.I struggled to find a character to care about. I do enjoy it as a mellow show to have on in the background. Does not require any active listening as there's a lack of plot, storyline and suspense.If you'd like something to captivate you, skip this.If you're looking for something easy to follow that is light and fluffy, this could fit the bill.",6
"Good show","They should focus more on servants like Dotown Abbey the Black family Plot intresting. Battle of the Butlers is fun and French cook is fun to watch. Production is good. Costumes design is Emmy worthy. Robber barons are cold blooded and wives are at their at mercy of the purse strings.",7
"Stereotypes, cliches, pandering","Here we go again. Another story that's going to focus on race and class and sexual orientation, blah blah blah while playing up to tired old one dimensional female tropes like shy but plucky ingenues and cliche catfights between malevolent matrons. Newsflash: in 1882, women of all races, classes and sexual orientations were the legal property of their husbands under common law coverture with no legal identity or civil rights of their own, including the vote. To make it look like ""rich white women"" had all this formidable power is a gross misrepresentation of this historical time period to pander to today's zeitgeist. This is made for the Harlequin romance reader with regressive ideas about women. Skip it.",2
"Just being picky","Meryl should have married into good looks .Her daughters are,let's say, not beautiful. Also Cynthia Nixon s talents are going to waste here. Mostly pretty good series with great scenery and costumes.",7
"Entertaining but not all great acting","The Gilded Age is definitely entertaining and has beautiful inside sets and costumes. The outside sets and buildings are not very expansive and look somewhat fake. The story line is simple but interesting and the subplots keep your attention. There are many good actors such as Carrie Coon, Morgan Spector, and Christine Baranski. Luisa Jacobson as Marian Brook does an ok job but she lacks the depth of talent that her mother, Meryl Streep, possesses. Cynthia Nixon is so fake, especially that voice! Even though her character is kind and I want to like her, she's so annoying that I cringe when she's speaking. She's really bad! Whoever cast her for that role made a big mistake. Surely they could have found someone better. I don't think Taissa Farmiga, as Gladys Russell, is very good either.It's interesting to see the goings on of the servants too but this show doesn't get nearly as involved in their lives or stories, like Downton Abbey did. That seems like a missed opportunity.Overall, this show is definitely worth watching but it lacks the A+ acting, dialogue, and scenery of that rare gem, Downton Abbey (excluding Elizabeth McGovern as Cora, who was terrible). If you liked Downton you will probably like The Gilded Age.",7
"Very hard to watch.","We couldn't do it any more. We had to stop. Very disappointing. The acting is horrible. Waste of time. I wish it was good, but there is nothing. Very forced feeling.",1
"Rehashed formulae","Not much creativity because the same upstairs/downstairs dynamic has been overdone in many other period pieces; the characters are very familiar as are the dramatic scenarios - any Downton Abbey fan or similar ilk will recognize these. Cynthia Nixon's accent and all the Black character's accents are overly dramatized and all are annoying to the ear. Cynthia's character (Ada?) in general seems quite out of place and too much of a milquetoast to be believable; makes me cringe whenever she occupies the scene.I do enjoy scenes with Mrs Russell and find her voice rather different and pleasant to listen to. But beyond the beautiful costumes the writers did not do much more than adapt well-known antics of the robber barons and their wives from days gone by.",6
"Feeble attempts at American Downton Abbey.","As the title suggests, the series relies on gilded interiors, garish wardrobe and abundance of glistening jewels to carry its story. The story itself, although showing much promise, is moving too slowly to keep my attention. There are definitely parts of it that might be very interesting and could develop into a true drama, but honestly, I'm not sure it will keep my attention long enough for that to happen. I'm at s1 e5 and if the show was cancelled tomorrow, I wouldn't be heartbroken. It has not truly captured my attention. Let's face it, American writing will never equal English/European writing.For now, I watch to learn some interesting tidbits of 19th century New York (that I hope are correct) but I'm not sure I'll make it to season 2.",6
"A dreadful bore","Dreadful 21st -Century vernacular masquerading as sophisticated 19th -century dialog.Costuming...OK.The rest?Nah...Writers undoubtedly have no idea of the culture that existed in the gilded age...and have written with their heads in a vacuum.Not worth another minute.",1
"I'll give it a chance","I have already said that the first series usually sets the tone, the game ... This series is an excellent example of the fact that neither the first nor the second series, what can I say, the whole season as a whole was not set for the game. Tyagomotina, pouring from empty to empty one and the same problem. Attempts to start at least some intrigue were shattered. There is not so much plot development, there is not even a hint of it. Everything is in place. Even the previous ""Belgravia"" will be livelier. I couldn't help but feel like the whole season was just the first episode. The plot of the plot .. sickly first episode at nine o'clock))) Excellent actors are trying, but nothing comes of this script. They just have nothing to play. The whole season is just empty. Beautiful, glamorous, but empty. The only thing that I can note is the opening credits and music. Delight!!. In general, the work has been done notably, it's a pity that in fact it turned out just a beautiful picture, there's nothing to catch on, and there's no one to catch on.",7
"Uneven at best.","I had hopes for this, as it's coming from Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, but there's so much that misses the mark. Perhaps if they have Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon just yuk it up like the Baldwin sisters from ""The Waltons"" or something. Maybe the audience needs some recipe to get through this.The girl from Bridgerton is doing her Bridgerton thing. I don't know if she's 30 or 20. What's with the valet with a shaved head? I find it hard to believe a valet in the 1870s would have had time to shave his head like that with a straight razor every day. The snotty wannabe woman talks too fast and needs language lessons if she's going to be haughty. It was easy to see that mustache boy was going to like other boys, totally predictable, and the set seemed way too clean (and the teeth on the actors way too white) for 1870s New York City.Who would ever believe that Meryl Streep spawned Louisa Jacobsen. Louisa inherited no acting ability whatsoever and she'd be better off in a high school production of Oklahoma. She is the weakest link, without question.Oh, the fake O'Brien downstairs is awful too.Spray some perfume on it and get better writers.",4
"Episode 1: Julian Lays An Egg","Perhaps, the producers hoped that the sets and costumes would distract from a banal script, and utterly wooden acting. No one would have the slightest interest in getting to know these two-dimensional excuses for people. The dialogue would shame a very poor soap opera. The inevitable comparison with Downton Abby suggests that Julian get very, very, lucky in the group of actors who embraced their roles in that excellent series, and ran off into the distance with them.The sole acting bright spot... the actresses who played Miss Scott, and her mother, were entirely believable and fit right into the period seamlessly.I will ignore the rest of this unfortunate production.",2
"Why not make sure the language is authentic?","I came late to this series and started watching episode 6. One character referred to her mother having her under 'house arrest', a term which did not come into use until the 1960s. I find it very odd that so many period dramas expend such effort on ensuring that costumes, buildings, behaviours and social mores are correctly depicted, but do not do the same with the language used. As I watch, a character has spoken of 'running for the hills'. Again, this is a later expression. It really does not take long to check these things. Vichyssoise soup? Early 20th century. What is the point of authenticity if it doesn't apply to all aspects of the production?",3
"Hack - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","All Fellows did was read a book about Alva Vanderbilt, write a script that completely steals from that book and create script that would entertain a 13 year old teenage girl. This is predictable, silly and about as one dimensional as they come. What a waste of time.",1
"Holy hell it's bad!","Are they kidding right now with this 8 star rating? I made it exactly 21 minutes into the first episode and couldn't take any more of the horrible acting. The woman gets her purse stolen at the train station and does absolutely nothing, doesn't yell out that her purse was just stolen, quietly sits there and cries when it literally happened 10 seconds before? Forget this one! Seriously though the acting is so bad and phony.",1
"Downton Abbey wannabe","Don't waste your time. The Gilded Age never gets good. The characthers are flat, stereotyped and very very boring. A shame really. Had expected the American take on the upstairs/downstairs story.",1
"Oh look, there's Mrs. Patmore!?","Stiff, self conscious reinterpretation of Downton Abbey on the other side of the Atlantic. Dull, predictable and cheap despite the obvious money spent on the production. They certainly didn't get their dollar's worth what with the regurgitated soundtrack, badly rendered CGI and phoned in performances.I suppose if you're a fan of costume dramas you'll enjoy this but it lacks the soul and polish of DA.",2
"I wanted to love this","I wanted to love this. Amazing actors and such a great story line.But the acting by Jacobson is boring ...so boring. Obviously this is nepotism as she is Meryl Streep's daughter but she just ruins the show.",5
"Horrible CGI","Can't argue with the negative comments about poor script, wooden acting, etc. Didn't see a mention, though, of the terrible CGI effects, which were so bad they were distracting. Animated films look more realistic than the cardboard cutout sea scenes or views down 61st Street. So let me add that to the list. Costumes are great, though.",2
"Disappointment on the Upper East Side","Not much to crow about in this one. Uninteresting characters, curiously pedestrian writing, costumes that are much too pretty, surprisingly dull acting from very talented people. Considering the pedigree, so many of us were expecting so much from this series. But alas, nothing seems to work.",4
"This was beautiful","In the beginning. It has transformed into a predictable, sophomoric piece of drivel that furthers no cause and doesn't entertain. What could have been great, not doesn't even pass for good.",3
"Walk Away...Be Afraid","If my English 101 professor had a crack at the scripts the pages would have been covered in red ink criticisms: hackneyed, trite, commonplace, unoriginal...how about some period research? Talent below that of the Hallmark Channel slogging through a journey of utter tedium. What a disappointment.",2
"Extraordinary production values terrible casting, direction and acting","It is almost heartbreaking to see something so lavish in production values (costumes are rich and go a long way in defining the ""tribes"") so lacking in the performances. It feels the director is in a terrible hurry and all deliveries are rushed - there is none of the timing and nuanced layering that Downton Abbey was so rich with. Perhaps there is
a disconnect between the very British author and the very American cast and they don't share the same ear for language. I would have hoped a small cameo from one of the great thespians could have graced roles such as Mrs. Astor - (think of a Leslie Manville) but no such luck. Some of the acting in some principal roles is positively leaden except for Cynthia Nixon who makes a valiant attempt. Sadly disappointing.",3
"Inexplicably dull","When you consider all of the money and talent that went into this show it makes no sense whatsoever that it is so excruciatingly bad - the writing is flat, the directing turgid, and most of all, surprisingly, the acting is terrible. Louisa Jacobson is incapable of carrying any scene and projects all the charisma of wet towel, and frankly no one else does much better. The only exception is Cynthia Nixon who somehow manages to shine in her role. All in all, an abysmal, totally surprising, flop.",1
"Disappointingly banal","Too many one-dimensional characters in this one! And weird casting: for instance Carrie Coon who is awkwardly stiff; and another of Meryl Streeps daughters...who I think only got into drama school cause of her mum. She has the charisma of a potted plant. Sorry, but talent isn't hereditary.But the storyline too is full of klichées: the GOOD black girl who gets completely integrated into the white Van Rhijn household within just a few days! The scheming maid in the Russell household who is out to seduce Mr Russell and too demonstratively so. I could go on and on....",2
"Dull, just a dull and boring story.","I really wanted to love the show. I love period pieces, I loved Downton Abbey and from the trailer it seemed it would be similar in direction, but it just falls so flat.It's a shame, such a well casted series (except for Mrs. Russell) could be so dull. Not even the sub-stories have any sort of intriguing attributes. The costumes are about the only good thing going for the show really.",2
"Cartoonish.","If you want to see a far, far better look at about this same period in New York watch Martin Scorcese's beautiful film ""The Age Of Innocence"". Granted that this is based on just the 1st episode of ""The Gilded Age"" and they are busy introducing many characters and situations - so it could get better - as others have stated with the exception of the costumes this is struggling from the get go. The writing is so cartoonish. You've seen these characters a zillion times before in equally awful shows/films.This is setting up to be a woman's costumed soap opera fantasy in which women run everything while their rich husbands are busy doing super over the top robber baron behavior. The dialogue is very poor. Sadly, recent years have seen that the once great HBO has driven itself off a very high cliff. Too bad.",3
"Wasted production values.","I am a fan of history/period drama. I liked ""Downton Abbey"". I am fairly well read on East Coast aristocracy since I am a native Bostonian. I have visited many houses of The Gilded Age and The Victorian Age in America. I think the visual production values are very good.The casting/direction/writing for the aristocrats is all wrong with the exception of Ms. Baranski and Ms. Nixon. Why are the old aristocrats written to be so much real and human than the social upstarts, the Russel family? The gay live-in relationship of the Van Rijn/Adams partners is quite unlikely in that period.The portrayal of Stanford White as a wimpy, middles-aged sycophant in his behavior toward the upstart Russells is also bad writing. White was a dashing rake (in his 20s-30s in the 1880s), noted for his ego and bravado. This illustrates the problem of throwing in real historic characters without doing proper research.Perhaps this production shows the growing disrespect for our real history, lived by real people? Perhaps Julian Fellowes confused which side of the Atlantic his production was portraying?",2
"It's terribly pretty and also one dimensional","It's a big budget soapy. So interesting in that, there are some very good actors in it, but they're not acting . I can't figure out how this happens. Not a one behaves as a real person. It's just silver plate. Watch Gentleman Jack to see the polar opposite. GJ you can bite in to and dent it like 24k. Layers upon layers of real humans. The two leads in the Gilded Age are rice paper thin, so predictable. They must have spent so much money to shoot this, such a shame to not let one actor do what they know to do. In fact, I'm not sure how it's been accomplished! Surely one person tried to throw in a meaningful gesture or a pause that could hook in to my humanness....so it must be being directed out of them! Polished and ...fake. This kind of thing can't hold my attention. I'm surprised it's on HBO. They've come a long way from Deadwood, the Wire, 6 feet Under. Such a shame.",4
"Insulting","This is not ""Downton Abbey"" lite. Awkwardly written, stiffly acted and prosaically filmed, it insults the intelligence of its audience by repeatedly announcing the characters' motivations and intentions, as if they weren't already painfully obvious.",3
"Very Disappointing","It would be foolish of me to parrot everything that has already been posted about what is either missing, contrived or dull about this latest undertaking of Fellowes. But, he must be called on a few extra things.The costumes are magnificent but that's all TGA has going for it. And it's a shame. I was hoping to discover the same magic found in Downton but it not only isn't there, it's practically a parody. From the too bright lighting to the abysmal writing, it falls on every mark that matters.We want to care, to despise, and get involved in the characters but Fellowes has made it impossible by spending too much money and time on the look of the thing and forgetting substance.The wide eyed girl who enters this gilded-not-gold world looks as if she was on her way to work on When Calls The Heart but got lost, Christine Baranski, a fine actress, is utterly wasted, trussed up and delivers pathetic lines with an unnatural constipation, the evil titan should take lessons from O'Brien/Barrow and maybe kick out a cane from underneath somebody, and Mrs. Russell! Give her the hook. She's not even close to being a decent actress no matter how many fancy gowns she wears.If you need any example of the sterilization of this thing, just compare the kitchens of the frazzled yet kind Mrs. Patmore to the freshly starched French chef. We believed she cooked in that kitchen but not so with Frenchie. There's not a bead of sweat on his uppity brow.I signed on with HBO to watch this but canceled it last night. This is, for me, one of Fellowes' biggest mistakes especially considering the opportunity wasted on a fascinating time in American history. Thumbs way down.",1
"The disappointed Age...","I adored Downton Abbey and was so excited for this show but very disappointing. Downton has such appealing characters and drew me in right away. I could not even make it through episode one of this! The characters are monotone and boring - no one stood out. Not likable at all in my opinion. The acting seemed very scripted as if they were just reading lines, it did not seem natural like Downton. Not a fan.",1
"Wake me up","I like the setting, but that is where the compliments end. There are no real likable characters, acting is sub-par, and there is nothing real exciting about the show. The show lacks originality, I feel like they are trying to copy Downton Abbey, but failed. Extremely disappointed.",3
"Disappointing","I had high hopes for this. I truly love period pieces, and I was a huge fan of Downton. However I have to admit I wasn't even able to finish the first episode of this, though I really did try to stick it out. It was so boring, so one dimensional. None of the characters were interesting enough that I'd want to keep watching to see more of them. It's all very pretty aesthetically, but underneath the costume and the architecture this show seems hollow and soulless. I'm confused by how bad it is.",3
"Slow and uneventful.","Do note that time will stand still in this sleepy production. Nothing will happen. You will not have any interest in 90% of the characters. The lead actress is an example of a plain jane, so much so that one feels that is there a backlash against being pretty nowadays? Still, the sets are good. You do get a feel of those times. I would call this a poor cousin of downtown abbey. Sadly that was a much better series on all fronts. This is just about tolerable. Using colored characters just to show 'racial inclusiveness ' is also unfair in my opinion towards the colored people of USA. There seems to be an attempt to whitewash their mistreatment during those times by such lackadaisical efforts. All in all a forgettable effort.",5
"Disappointing","Costumes, Benton, and of course Baranski were great. The rest is pretty terrible. The writing is bad, the casting is bad, the bizarre and intrusive wokeness is bad. Almost every character is competing for most unlikeable. The ""heroine"" can't act and is basically an awful ungrateful brat. I mean her Aunt, who was a complete stranger, took her in out of the kindness of her heart and she can't give it a week before she starts breaking the house rules and telling her Aunt to pound sand? Maybe just a little gratitude? Downton tackled issues like class and sexual orientation with subtlety and nuance. This is just a big old clumsy woke hammer to the face. Pass.",2
"Grossly over gilded.","I'm a big fan of Downton.This is a cheap knock off.The acting is belabored as thoroughly modern actors attempt the airs of old and new money in old New York. It's like trying to sit through mediocre regional theater, ahem, theatre.So thirty-one minutes and thirty-four seconds in I got up and fled never to return.",4
"With a cast like this you'd expect magic","Nope. I imagine it's difficult to act with a late 1800s accent, but as terrific a cast as this has they just couldn't pull it off. The only thing worse was the dialog. Check that, the plot was tedious and soap operatic. Aside from the beautiful sets (which weren't realistic given how clean the streets looked in the horse and carriage era) there isn't much going for this.",3
"My gawd where to begin...","The acting, the dialogue, the staging, the directing, the editing, the set design, the lighting.....I am no expert but if it wasn't for the costumes this would be appropriate for YouTube.",1
"A waste of time and talent","Julian Fellows doesn't realize that American ""royalty"" bears no resemblance to Downton Abbey. He has created a set of cardboard characters and made them a script that is sophomoric. Even Christine Baranski's vitriolic overacting can't rescue this pretentious trash.",1
"Really rather silly and shallow","The ongoing intrigue between the social climbers in NYC is for the most part just ugly to me. If NYC was really like this, I can see how we ended up worshipping wealth above all else in this country. I don't see the series as ""woke"" in any way. Just the presence of people of color and gay people is not in itself ""woke."" A waste of time and talent for the most part. They could have done great things with this amazing cast but they wasted them on a silly, really rather irritating soapy story line.",5
"I'm actually disappointed-","Had high hopes. But it just doesn't quite cut it. It's like watching a Play. The actors, while some are long time favorites, are just so stiff and one dimensional.Just doesn't work for me personally.",3
"Bad Acting and some unfortunate casting to boot!","Is it my imagination or is the acting (and writing) really that bad? Cynthia Nixon is wrongly cast in the role she so hideously tries to play---(stick w SATC offshoot AJLT--though another very bad show) add to the mix...Christine Baranski. Why oh why? So many actors to choose from. Seems like many of the actors are not cast correctly and give what I would call nothing but ""line readings"". Still I like a period drama and will stick with mostly ""listening"" while I knit, meaning I am not really watching------it's a backgrounder........",5
"So bad it's good.","This is a bad show. Even so, I find its ridiculous, unbelievable dialogue and plot strangely enthralling. It's as if I can't wait to see how ludicrous it can get.",2
"Decent period piece soap opera","It's...meh ok. I've watched every episode, as I do like period pieces. The directing, costumes, setting, supporting cast, it's all there. The dialog is not. Some subpar writing in this series. I have to say, Louisa Jacobson as the lead, not a good choice. She adds nothing, and is dead weight. This series could have stood out, with an inspired lead, like what Rachel Brosnahan brings to Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. I don't mean her particularly, but it would take that kind of KA-BLAM to make this anything other than something to set your eyeballs on while you eat a quart of your favorite ice cream.It's fine...not recommended.",5
"The Wooden Age","Was really looking forward to this serial as I love period dramas but this is hugely disappointing. The characters are wooden and may as well carry their script with them as they deliver the trite dialogue. Might have worked better as a musical! However will continue to watch as I love the costumes and the dog.",2
"Less like Downton Abbey, more like ""Downturn Abbey""","This is a soap opera that borrows heavily from the original Downton Abbey series. Many of the cinematography techniques as well as characters used, are the same (except here, they are totally uninteresting and unconvincing). What is not similar however is the rubbish script, the use of D grade actors and a very predictable story! The acting is really bad, more at the level of a ""table read"" or community theater, where the lines are just read. But without the required level of emoting. The series has clearly been done on the cheap (as one can see from the heavy use of CGIs).The series comes across as a venture that screams ""Let's try this and see where it goes"". It probably will not get much beyond one season, or the confines of 5th Avenue!",3
"Nonsense with poor writing and horrible acting","Rounding out a menagerie of bad acting and writing is the lead actress, who appears unable to act despite staffing in the main role. The writing is flawed and over dramatic and feels much more like a poorly-funded soap opera than an HBO show by the creator of Downtown Abbey.",2
"great expectations meet the American acting.","The result is a dreadful one. As much as I talked to myself not to expect much, the reality was much worse. The show is just very poorly acted, bad written and in a whole just not interesting. Good people, if you want to keep the good name of the creator in your memory just avoid this one and hope for something that will be close to ""Downton"" in the future.",2
"ick! Julian Fellowes one trick pony","How bad this is... where to even start? Take the Downtown scripts and characters and reuse them first. UGH. Christine Baransky is no Maggie Smith and giving her pithy lines will never make her cute or funny. The usual overacting on her part -- and now others acting in kind, so disappointingly. And playing little arcs of cutesy music after different lines is so sickening - like ""here - this is so cute!!"". UGH. So sad to see talents like Carrie Coon in this - she's simply awful in this part through no part of her own.I can't believe anyone spent a dime on this thing in times like now when so many people are in need. The whole thing is garbage.",1
"Yet again....","Julian Fellowes loves rewriting history to smokescreen his upper class ancestors and now their friends in New York. The snobbery is between the wealthy and the nouveau rich, but all the class and racial issues that were real are discarded and all the upper class are so terribly terribly decent. It's a distortion that removes all the possibilities for real drama in a time that in real life was fascinating.",2
"Awful","It's an American (and embarrassing) attempt at a Downton Abbey. Honestly, it's all production value and no soul - there is no chemistry between any of the characters and the dialogue is unnatural and full of period piece cliches. Avoid at all costs!",3
"This is a HARD pass and really not worth your time or consideration","You just couldn't get behind the characters...especially the ungrateful and just amateurish actress that plays Miriam...I hope her character won't be a regular. The costumes were beautiful and visually pleasing but that is it....there no depth to the characters or story for that matter..people are better for next Downtown movie...and was so looking forward to this ...now I feel I just truly wasted my hope and optimism. Let's try for better Julianne Fellows..you are better than this...don't phone it in.",2
"Worst victorian spoof ever!!!!","You can all admit that there's nothing much entertaining coming out of a storyline like this genre in the first place. But, however, this came with such a great bunch of supporting roles, production values and customes only to be thwarted by a 40+ looking, plain and untalented main lead of an actress who took every chance she could to act like a 14yr old Judy Garland.I'm not gonna further elaborate but if you value your time and effort as a productive human being, do not watch this series even if you're getting paid to do so.",1
"Trying way too hard","Like every other Downton fan I was looking forward to this show. I'm pretty familiar with the gilded age and the prominent families of New York, but did not expect almost all of them to be introduced or name dropped in the first episode. While everything looks beautiful, the dizzying pace of the introduction of cast and plot was off putting. A slower pace is needed. Also, every time I hear Christine Baranski's butler talk it reminds me how much better Downton was (he played King George in the movie).",5
"Looks like Desperate Housewives","But takes place in early New York. The problem is that there are so few original ideas. Just because you have some good and popular actors, doesn't make the show any good.",3
"S T O O P I D","I believe the general consensus is that it's truly hard to believe there's any Fellows influence. I suppose writing and acting need to be commensurate with the average American's level of education, which is pathetic. It's hard to imagine so much effort and money would go into costumes and scenery (even if it's CGI, which is actually very good); but the acting, dialogue, and overall execution are as profoundly stupid as an episode of Selling Sunset.",1
"I've strained myself trying to drum up interest.","Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones were masterpieces. The Gilded Age and The House of Dragons are not; and yet people dare to view them in the same light.This thing is drab, boring, uninteresting and lazy. It could do with a few murders and illegitimate births. If the characters are gay, lets have some gay intrigue. Am I jaded?I can't say anymore about it. Its just bad. No storyline, no passion, no fleshed out characters...no reason to continue watching. Think I'll go watch Downton Abbey for the 4th time or Game of Thrones for the 6th. An episode of I Love Lucy has much more to offer. Admiring the costumes can only go so far.",3
"Tries but lacking and falls well short","The Gilded Age is to Downton Abbey what The Hobbit trilogy was to Lord of the Rings. Well intended to draft off the elements that were executed so successfully but unfortunately stumbles at every step. Great cast, poorly used and errantly directed. Interesting setting needless due to weak storylines and clumsy dialog. Even the production value and cinematography lack depth and texture. If Downtown is Masterpiece Theater then Gilded is the Lifetime Network equivalent. Too bad.",5
"A turkey with lots of dressing","Once you get past the cringeworthy dialogue, wooden acting by several leads, and plot lines that keep you wondering who cares, the scenery is quite nice.",4
"Another Predictable Soap Opera","Another predictable, boring, forced soap opera.The costume design is great, but everything else is a disaster. Unconvincing characters, hilarious dialogue and disastrous casting.The casting is disastrous and the characters are predictable and forced, but at least it's clear to us at the beginning that there's no point in wasting time on something this bad.The dialogues are hilarious, at times too modern, and everything seems fake and forced. The characters are unconvincing, and the events that follow are predictable, boring, writers simply can no longer write a solid period piece. This looks like a fantasy, a complete parody.The show is predictable, like most of today's film production. Just one episode is enough to conclude that there is no point in wasting time on this disaster. Some things here are completely unnecessary, CGI could be better, after the first episode is over, it was clear that this is the last one I will watch.Nowadays there is a lot of content, unfortunately the vast majority of it is unwatchable, but there are still some good things, and there is a lot of older things to watch, from movies to shows, which are on average much better than today.This show is a typical example of all that is bad in today's film production. I may be a little harsh, but that's because I thought this might be different after all, so my disappointment is even greater.There was potential, but in the end it turned out to be just another disappointment. Fake, forced, and worst of all, exhaustingly boring.",5
"It did not get better","I forced myself to finish the first season in hopes that it would improve and that the characters would grow and become interesting. But no, as usual, Hollywood makes pale copies and think that by just throwing together a bunch of good looking people, it will be a hit. A few of them can act, but there are zero chemistry between them.At the end of the series, I don't even know what a single one of the staffs name is and let alone anything about them.Bigger are rarely better.",2
"Same Dribble different accent","Downtown Abbey with American accents. Why does this guy still live in the past, maybe as a result of his place in the house of lords, he doesn't realise that the real world has well and truly moved on.",2
"Downton Abbey? Don't kid yourselves.","I heard about The Gilded Age on NPR where, as it is very popular, it was compared to Downton Abbey. Well, let me tell you that to compare this to Downton Abbey is a blasphemy. It doesn't even come close. Besides all the other issues other negative reviews mentioned, the characters are simply unlikeable. I couldn't stand their pompous, arrogant and shallow personalities which makes it very hard to become invested in their stories. The acting is stiff as the dialogue is ridiculous. CGI is laughable and looks cartoonish. This show is just a ton of wasted potential of what could've otherwise been a very interesting insight into a fascinating period of American history. Just another victim of a subscription streaming service wars, I guess. Quantity over quality.",5
"Bye Bye!","Dreadful. Two episodes in and I'm gone. As opposed to Downtown Abbey, the producers tried to do this series on-the-cheap. It shows in the third-rate writing, the second-rate acting and the overall look and feel of the series.And, of course, the forced wokeness is annoying.Over and out!",2
"Disappointing !","It starts quite nice ! So you want to continue watching !But after 4 or 5 episodes the serie turns really boring.All we get is people inviting other people for tea or dinner. Thaty's it.I REALLY like Downton Abbey, But this is just unwatchable.There are way too many characters, and none of them has a really interesting storyline.Don't waste your time on this one !",1
"Ugh","An awful attempt to be another Downton Abbey but Christine Baranski is NO Maggie Smith. Julian Fellows has missed the mark. The Gilded Age could have been interesting but the characters don't have anything to offer in the way of excitement.",2
"Writing is terrible","At first I thought it was the acting that was bad, but it is the writing that is so terrible. What are supposed to be witticisms fall flat, the pace is incredibly slow when it doesn't have to be, and in the end it's just boring.",4
"If You Like ""Woke"" You Won't be Disappointed","I realize this is a drama series loosely based on the powerful families that changed the United States, but honestly... the wokeness is rampant and obviously intended to persuade people that don't know any better. Too bad for HBO. Nobody wants to see made up versions of history.",3
"a bit flat","I'm a huge fan of Downton Abbey, and historical dramas/movies in general so I was really looking forward to this title. However I must say I'm rather disappointed. Characters are ... flat..? I'm not interested in any of the storylines, there is no stakes, everything is just centered around money. None of the characters is particulary likable or memorable, can't even remember their names. I will keep watching, but so far it has been a terrible disappointment.",5
"Beautiful to look at but lacking in substance","I'm giving it 5 stars because the costumes, sets, even the hairstyles are all lovely to look at. I'm 4 episodes in and it's simply missing a compelling story. Many of the characters are shallow and selfish and hard to connect with. And it's lacking biting wit. I'm watching All Creatures Great and Small as well right now and somehow the simple stories of a country vet have managed to be more interesting. I'm sure I'll keep watching because I keep expecting something to happen. Also if my employee tries to seduce my husband he'd better sack her and not keep her around to spare my feelings. Don't worry, I'll get over it. Very silly plot.",5
"Beautiful clothes","But beautiful clothes don't make a beautiful story. It feels like the actors are reading their lines. It's stilted, but I'll watch it anyway to see what happens.",3
"Hoping for better to come...","Sorry but the dialogue seemed stiff and stilted. And it seemed to be shot on video where as Downton had a rich film quality about it. The overall flow wast quite there.",1
"Am Dram","The awful drivelling music that nearly ruins every scene strips away any natural ambience. The sets, the costumes and the plot should exude ambience but it just doesn't work. All of the spoken sound appears to be dubbed which renders it expressionless. What a waste of resources.",1
"Fellows' Folly.....pure kitsch and not in a good way","Julian Fellows' new series about the 'haves and have nots' in fin de siecle New York is unwatchable wasting the talents of great actors the like of Morgan Spector, Christine Baranski, Cynthia Nixon and Audra MacDonald, among others. I will watch Spector and MacDonald read a lottery ticket, but watching Baranski, coiffured and dressed up to look like Lizzie Borden, flare her nostrils and utter some of the most stilted dialogue with a straight face is cringe-inducing.",2
"The world according to Julian Fellowes","The problem with Julian Fellowes is that everyone thinks he is some kind of historian, but, he isn't. Fellowes write upper class soap operas with little to no real research. He relies on his audience believing he knows what he is writing about because he has an upper class English accent. But, this man recently declared that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were trapped in a 'loveless marriage', something he couldn't be more wrong about as historical evidence has proven time and again.Look if you want to watch it because you think Downton Abbey is realistic then that's up to you, but, if you are someone with an understanding of the subjects and likes some kind of effort in having some historical realities then don't bother, you will find yourself being distracted far to much with the inaccuracies.Saying that, the cast are first rate, which is in it's favour.",1
"Gave up midway through Season 2","I really wanted to like The Gilded Age. I love history, that era, New York and Julian Fellows. The first season was good enough to hold my interest to the end. The battle of the old and new rich seems plausible and fit together pretty well.Season 2 was just dreadful. First battling over the opera houses, then wooing a Duke to Newport and adding in racial issues in the South never made sense. It was like let's throw everything in but the kitchen sink and see what sticks. Really none of it does. I'm giving up-I pulled it from my watchlist and will move on to shows that are well written. This one is not.",3
"Boring like you wouldn't believe","The writing so bad it makes the acting horrible...I turned it off with about 15 minutes left in the second episode. If you're looking for something Downton Abbey-esque....watch Downton Abbey.",3
"CG weirdness","I appreciate that Covid has made things more difficult, but I wish they could use more realistic, actual sets. I am continually pulled out of this as it is obviously making extensive use of a green screen. Tip to anyone who works this way - soften the edges of the actors, as they seem to float in front of the scenery.",5
"Downmarket Abbey","I'll watch because I watch all the costume dramas but it's over acted and plot of old money vs new money is over done. I never Understand the sad social climbing. Do you want to have them ad friends or stab them in the back ? Great costumes. Waste of Audra (as usual.). I'll watch and hope it gets better. Belgravia was better if you like this sorta thing.",5
"Disappointing","The gilded age was also a time o grace and elegance. They made this a dog eat dog world where the main characters seem vicious. This is As if it were Billions set in a different era. Do some research not just Downtown Abbey creators cashing in on the US during the era. I will not be watching.",1
"Must we endure a vapid story of the FIRST Gilded Age as we suffer through the SECOND Gilded Age?","Do we need or want yet another drama centered on extremely wealthy individuals?It's disgusting to watch a fictional story of the FIRST Gilded Age when we're living in the SECOND Gilded Age.What happened to HBO? The Sopranos, The Wire, all the great dramas of twenty years ago have been replaced with this vapid dross. Has HBO been bought by Disney?Read the room.Nobody wants or needs this tale of obscene inequality as the nightmare is repeating itself today.",3
"Started strong, finished week","The first season started strong but the family vying to be accepted was way too rich to not be. Still, the cast delivered along with scenery and costumes.Second Season, however, is a disappointment on HBO more than the cast. Yes, spoilers ahead. First, that maid could not have gotten married to such a wealthy man without all those ladies not knowing. Second, you give Ada a ministerial husband which was quite nice, only to kill him off in the next episode? I know time flies but that was a dreadful subplot. Third, Oscar loses all the family money, which was entirely possible, with little to no accountability, only to get it back from the dead priest's estate?I enjoy period pieces but if HBO doesn't write a third season that seems to have some reality and character development, I would say just cancel it. HBO has a history of amazing productions. They need to work on this one.",3
"19C versions of Zuckerberg and Bezos are my ""heroes"" of American progress, HBO?","Sure, Downton Abbey shamelessly romanticized and whitewashed the horrendously unjust, hereditary class hierarchy of the Victorian and Edwardian eras in England. But at least the show had a lot of charm, good acting and writing... and addressed the fact that the forces that would demolish once and for all those last, dying remnants of feudalism -- the social order typified by D Abbey and it's extended world -- was arguably just as bad: World War I, with its unspeakable and senseless brutality, and, along with it, the co-emergence of the merciless destructive juggernaut of modern capitalism. No period of change could be more ambiguous in its lack of anything to really root for; it was the death of one, terrible old social order and the birth and triumph of a monster system that was even more terrifying in its capacity for violence and dehumanization. So even though 90% of Downton was a love story to a fairly tale version of medieval patriarchal hierarchy, it was at least possible to sift below the surface-level romance to find some elements of the tragedy at the heart of this bleak period in which there was real beauty to be lost and nothing really good that could come as a result of all the upheaval the show depicts.The Gilded Age, on the other hand, offers us no such subtly and absolutely zero sense of the tragedy of this period of relentless, revolutionary, change that destabilized the entire social and economic order of the industrializing western world. Instead, it presents itself as a sweet, innocent paean to those great, unsung American heroes... the plucky, self-made made men (yes, the mf'ing ROBBER BARRONS!) who, poor guys and gals, could just never catch a break from NYC's crusty, snobby, bitter, envious old money... those cranky, stuffy, lazy, wanna-be 'aristocrats' who were trying in vain, by hook or by crook, to hold onto their diminishing turf in a world being devoured by the massive unregulated monopolistic trusts that faced no serous, organized opposition -- either from public officials or from the labor class that they so ruthlessly exploited to build their empires. Pity those industrious Russels, with whom we are undeniably supposed to identify, cruelly turned away from countless social occasions, spoken to with terrible snideness about their guache customs, and even denied attendance to the symphony in proper box seating. Oh, the humanity! However did those poor souls persevere through all that indignity?Have we ever really stopped to acknowledge, the show wants us to ask, our nation's profound debt of gratitude to the likes of saintly figures like JP Morgan, Rockefeller, Carnegie, Vanderbilt, or the Russels for their immense contributions to culture, growth, egalitarianism -- and even our world renowned institutions of charity?Oh, boy....As ludicrous as that premise sounds, and despite the show's occasional nods to the utter amorality, corruption, and rapacious greed of the new-money moguls, the bottom line is that that that's *really* the basic frame of the narrative: the 'nouveau riche', as the robber barons are delicately referred to, are somehow proposed as the heroes of our story! They're actually presented as the unjustly treated forces of *progress* we're supposed to rooting for in this self-aggrandizing, revisionist soap opera piece of trash of a show.Yeah, the writing is crap, the characters are stilted, boring and two-dimensional, and the plot lines are cingingly soap-opera level drek. Alas, that's unfortunately what you get with most dramas on TV, including (tragically, IMO, given the glorious golden-age history of unparalleled works of TV art like the Sopranos), on 'premium' cable like HBO. But what makes this show so offensively bad is its basic moral/historical premise: that some of the most virulently sociopathic monsters in the history of the country are the characters we're supposed to like and root for in their quest for ""acceptance"" by the old-guard NYC elite.The terrible quality of all the basic elements of quality TV in the Gilded Age are no big surprise, sadly enough. But excuse me while I puke and cry through my grimacing laughter at the very audacity the most core concept of the show itself.",3
"Downton, but make it not good.","After 2 eps, it's a No for me on Gilded Age.Period costume dramas check a lot of boxes for me, but for them to work, the writing really needs to have a knowingness to it. Downton creator Julian Fellowes wrote all of Downton by himself whereas Age has an American cowriter who's only other credits are Will & Grace, and Zoe Ever After.As a result, the dialogue about class, money, and the need the Old People have for keeping the New People out lacks the verve of Downton Abbey. Downton is quick slices of a rapier. Gilded Age endless pokes from a sharp stick in the same place.Unbelievable set design and likely Emmys for Wardrobe, but other than that, rather bland.",2
"No Downton.. more like High School Drama class...","I was looking forward to this new drama, I love Downton Abbey, but seriously the storyline stinks and Carrie Coon single handedly ruins the first episode, every scene with her was cringeworthy.... Baranski was the only bright spot for me, and didn't need the gay tryst at the end, that pretty much ended the whole season for me.",4
"Like Downton Abbey and yet so different","This series shares similarities with The Downton Abbey. Having the same author, Jullian Fellows, it's not surprisingly.This series takes place in mid-1800s in New York, USA. A new group of wealthy people are rising, threatening the old aristocracy. The new ones wants to be included in the old aristocracy's society, but are not familiar with the social rules, giving all the intrigues. The young generation of the old aristocracy is not so focused on who are the rIght people to socialize with, but who can provide them the fortune making it possible for them to continue their lives in the upper class.The series doesn't contain the same elegance and humor as Downton Abbey, where the viewer grows a deep desire to get to know the various characters better. This desire doesn't grow viewing this series. In Downton Abbey the viewers cheer for the characters climbing up the social hierarchy, but in The Gilded Age these characters are mostly someone's you get to despite because of their behavior and attitudes. Perhaps except for the main character, Marian Brook, played by Meryl Streep's daughter, Louisa Gummer.",5
"Mixed","I absolutely love Downton Abbey so I was excited about this series, but so far I'm totally let down. I can't stand the pettiness of these characters so I find it hard to watch. I hope the story line gets better otherwise I can't see myself sitting through much more. I like the costumes though.",2
"the music is so annoying I gave up","Really, what is it with the frolicking nauseating score? After three minutes I wanted to put my head through the TV screen. I tried watching with the sound off and the subtitles on but I couldn't even look at it. Diminishing returns. I may go back and give another try at some point but for now. It looks and sounds like old soup.",2
"Somebody please wake me up!","Formula 1 race car chassis are made from full, carbon fiber tubs. The stiffness is extraordinary, and few things on Earth could possibly be stiffer.Except...The contrived, non-conversational dialogue must be the reason for the stilted, ice-cold feeling that emanates from every character. Too many plot lines crammed into too short a time don't help. Key characters have atomic clock predictability about how they'll respond to every action, Baranski will be crabby, Nixon will be wimpy, Coons will be aggressive, Spector will be Mr Freeze, Nathan Lane will be....oh dear, that's supposed to be serious? There very little latitude or time for characters to develop. Secondary characters in Downton Abbey had solid backstories. Here, the staff are nearly furniture.Would using British actors faking American accents imbue a Western with authenticity? No. And a world that is essentially unknown to Americans that looks for all the world like English society gentry just doesn't fly with American accents. Too flat. But I suppose its accurate.And as others have mentioned, the sets, conveyances, costumes...everything looks brand-new, just built, just made. Sterile. Fake.Eh.",5
"I expected more...","The casting for me is strange... costumes are amazing. For a show about the new and old money in old New Yorks society... I honestly expected more than dull back biting lines delivered in dimly lit rooms.Downton had so much wit! The Golden Age 6 episodes in is disappointing, but I'm hopeful for it to get its feet under it and bring some of the really talented writing that I know is possible!",5
"Easy, uncomplicated watch but overall a disappointment","I have watched the whole season and managed to do so in two sittings. Definitely entertaining, the costumes in particular are exquisitely designed. Most of the acting is good although I found Marion to be awfully miscast and dreadfully annoying.The problem with The Gilded Age lies in the fact that it will always be compared to Downton Abbey being created, produced and written by the same person. This is no Downton Abbey and if you compare the two you will be disappointed. There are far more characters in The Gilded Age and they are far less developed and, on the whole, less likeable. The Gilded Age is also missing a Maggie Smith character. Christine Baranski does a sterling job in her role but the dialogue is less sharp, far less humorous, and ultimately, less powerful.If you take The Gilded Age as a stand alone, soap opera drama purely created to entertain, set in an interesting period of American history, then you will enjoy it.Overall there are many missed opportunities here. I will watch season 2 simply because it is an easy, harmless, uncomplicated watch but I hope it is written with less of a soap opera feel. Viewers are intelligent and should be treated as such. The Gilded Age is a ""period drama by numbers"" affair that could have been so much more.5/10 for the acting, costume design & set design.",5
"Bland","I don't recommend going into this series assuming it's as good as Downtown or BBC/Masterpiece period pieces. The acting is bad and unconvincing. I'm almost done with the first season and I still have no connection to the characters or storylines. I'm disappointed because this is a fascinating time period to cover, this could've been a great show!",3
"No comparison to Downton Abbey","Please don't compare this show to fabulous Downtown Abbey. Story is boring. Casting is terrible. Like Julian Fellowes's Doctor Thorne series this is just bad. Lead character actors Louisa Jacobson (Marion Brook) & Carrie Coon (Bertha Russell) monotone voices & acting were quite painful to listen to & watch.",2
"Ordinary","If hoping for Age of Innocent, this is more Days of our Lives.Looks cheap, shallow characters I dont care about, either ordinary cast or script (or both).Struggling to get through the first episode.",4
"Crash and Burn","It's a shame how important a story this is to be told right now as the gold plate of America is oxidizing off the leaden flatware that is everything we are or have become, and how far this falls off the mark. The accents, the relationships between capitalist tycoons and their social climbing wives, the dialog, the imagined world is some 1980s fantasy. You know, Wmericans didn't speak like we do now 150 years ago. And so the modern sensibilities of Christine Baransky and Cynthia Nixon, for two examples, glares of the gilt.",3
"Same music as Downton Abbey but no more similarities~","The acting is off, especially by Coon and her characters family. Cynthia Nixon is good as well as Audra McDonald but the script is horrible and awfully pretentious. I'm only one episode in and wary of another.",3
"Okay but lacking.","The costumes and sets are gorgeous. But they dialog is so blunt & ALWAYS obsessed with standing in society or money. And Miss Ada... was she dropped on her head as a baby that a women of her age is such a naive infant in all ways. It lacks Downtown Abbeys full characters & richer stories.",5
"Show got worse as it went along","After the chest episode I would have probably rated this show as a 7 or 8. But I'm glad I waited. This show is just dull. I don't care for any of the characters. The story lines are predictable and boring. Kind of hate watched it to see the beautiful costumes each week.Downton Abbey was a hit because the drama was at the level of a soap opera. Gilded Age lacks the camp and how absurd the plot lines of Downton were.",3
"Implausible storylines","I have watched season one in entirety and at first looked forward to every episode. There are many holes in the plot, though, and threads that were dropped without explanation. They used the real names of some characters but not others, which just caused confusion. I thought there was chemistry between Marian and Tom in the beginning, but it became obvious that he was using her for reasons that were never completely clear, because she came from nowhere and had no money but did have social status. He excluded her from social functions and was seeing other women, and although she was a young girl, could not possibly have been that naive. Going to a ball and dancing all night on the same day she was jilted made absolutely no sense; for one thing she would not have had time for all of that. Marion and Peggy's friendship would have never happened because racism and segregation were very much alive in those days. Gladys was based on a true story, and she and Larry were my favorite characters along with Aurora Fain. Bertha was too over the top to be believable. It was never explained why Mrs. Astor's husband was never around. That was actually quite a scandal in real life and a worthy story line. The costumes were beautiful and it was a nice diversion but too much of the story went nowhere and historically it was not very well researched. It will be interesting to see what happens in season two when the strike ends.",5
"Ehhh Terible...Teribol...","This show is terrible! I never write reviews but I just had to express my disgust in this show. The Gilded Age in NY was a great time period. There was a lot going on for a new country. Nothing happens on this show...it's all about parties for the rich. Acting is terrible and the way they talk was not like that. The writing is terrible too! A complete waste of time...This show really sucks.... On the nose dialogue...no plot!",1
"Louisa Jacobson is AWFUL","How can someone this bad carry any series?? Seriously - Julian Fellowes?? All his stuff from UK is absolutely beautiful with great casting! But the STAR is literally the WORST actress I have ever seen. She drags the whole show down. OMG. Then I find out she is Meryl Streep's daughter? Nepotism much? What is this - a Harvey Weinstein production? What an awful waste truly sad. This could have been epic. It's worse than Godfather 3...",3
"Stilted Dialog wrecks what should be Fantastic","The potential for greatness is all here. The budget, the production values, the actors, the score, the sets, everything except the writing.This time period is filled fantastic characters and stories. Where are the Rockefellers, Carnegies, Morgans, Vanderbilts, Roosevelts, Twain, and more? The post-Civil War politics? Suffrage? Temperance?The story it does choose to tell is fairly interesting, new money bashing its way into old New York tradition but the writing and directing weighs everything down. I can understand formal conversation when at public galas and events but the way the characters speak to one another in private, in the bedroom, is so unnatural.I know the actors are capable of better, but it seems like they are in strait jackets. They don't emote or express except to over-emote and over-express when it's not appropriate.It didn't help the first season's love story had all the heat of liquid nitrogen.The big story of the second season is really just a re-telling of the story of the first season. We do have a hint of unions and the excesses of unbridled capitalism brought on by the industrial age and only tempered by Teddy Roosevelt's interventions. Hopefully there will be more of that.I'd love to love this show. I really would. The dialog is so bad that I never find myself immersed.",5
"Awful","First of all, the main character Marion Brooks is supposed to be 17/18. I. Real life this actress is 30 and looks it. Why not cast a genuine ingenue like Bridgerton did, and make it more credible?! Louise Jacobson is a pretty girl but she is not a radiant 18 year old carrying the storyline here.Secondly the dialog is ok but the delivery is very modern. Awful. No subtlety or nuance or modulated voices. OMG where is Maggie Smith when you need her?!Lastly, the characters thus far are caricatures of their historical referents. The ruthless mogul, the intractable snobbery, the guileless out-of-towner, etcOverall, as compelling the sets and costumes, it is fighting against the flat delivery of dialog and predictable plot thus far.",1
"Average show","This is pretty average. There are good actors and average. It is not quite moving well. I think the actors lack chemistry. It is like watching a play. The costumes and scenery are great. The costumes are why I watch. I have no connection to the characters.",4
"People Are More Like Cartoons Than Real People","Being a big fan of Downton Abbey, we decided to give The Gilded Age a watch. Well, what a tremendous disappointment. It's as if the writers have completely ignored the fact that human beings are hard-wired to be empathetic, compassionate, and loving. We were expecting real people with real concerns. These folks are completely driven by greed, status, and selfishness. Unbelievable! We get it that there are pressures to fit in, but where's their humanity? Give these people some human kindness, unless of course, they are really cartoon characters who are pretending to be human. We did watch the first episode in its entirety, but that's it. Hitting the KILL SWITCH on this one.",3
"Costume drama, more costume than drama","Dorothy Parker once quipped that she weeps at the sight of Victorian costumes. I doubt she would have shed a tear over this one. The Gilded Age hits all the usual upstairs/downstairs notes-- mostly upstairs, of course, and dutifully woke, with Black and gay characters. Nice try. Unfortunately, fictional people need to rise above stereotypes, which this Gilded gang does not.My sympathies go to the two leads, Christine Baranski and Carrie Coons, worthy actresses cast to play two sides of the same coin (literally-- one old money, one new). For both women, their entire, and I mean ENTIRE, reason for living is social standing. Zero complexity.All the artistic effort was put into the sets (which are quite spectacular) and costumes (stay tuned). There is nothing new in the story, which is unoriginal to the point of boring, and even predictable. I didn't come to care about a single person, except for the patriarch played by John Douglas Thompson, who was a meaty character, and he nailed it.As for the costumes. Ye gods. I'm convinced that they are museum-quality accurate, and apparently no expense was spared, but the women dress to the nines morning, noon, and night, though they do occasionally remove their beribboned bonnets. Everyone else, including the starched servants, looks like they walked out of a diorama devoted to Victorian fashion.",5
"Worst Parents of the Gilded Age","This show should be called ""The Absolute Worst Parents of the Gilded Age."" I just watched 1883 which was set at the same time and it was about a million times better. Also I'm not sure I buy that the whole Downton Abbey vibe of ""Oh no! We don't have the right spoons for this particular desert and that is the entire plot of this whole episode!"" really flies in New York, USA. Like why are the servants so excited about being servants? They literally live in a country where they could drive a stake into the ground out West and be land owners. And just saying, the servants in Little Lord Fauntleroy, Pollyanna, and those kind of books were way closer to their employers on the social scale than their English counterparts. I read a ton of Henry James and people actually were capable of having interesting conversations during this era that were not just all, ""OMG! I didn't get invited to this super important party! This is the worst thing that has ever happened in the entire world!""",3
"Three Episodes is Enough","Intrusive score, stilted acting, plots so recycled they should come with a rating, 1 through 6, inside of a little triangle for each episode. To say that Julian Fellowes is a one trick pony would suggest that this were even mentionable in the company of ""Gosford Park"" or ""Downton Abbey."" But really, this day-glo monstrosity looks more like a cheap knock-off. Lavish sets and crisp costume design a watchable show do not make. ""Gilded Age"" suggests jokes and tropes as world-building insight. That should be alarming to anyone looking for the slightest wrinkle of invention in this staid, bland, lifeless dreck. Many scenes are wince-inducing, made eye-rolling by the constant interruption of dandified chamber music.This soulless, plotless yawn makes ""Downton Abbey"" look like Shakespeare. And who wouldn't prefer ""Another Period"" to this strained attempt at dramedy?",3
"A 'thumbs-down' show.","Sterile script, sets/settings, 'wooden', unbelievable, and implausible 'hammy' acting(two-dimensional, disengaged performances; one actor to another, parrot-style line delivery, speaking 'at' each other, rather than 'to' each other).Disappointing, especially on learning that this is a 'Julienne Fellows' production.I had high hopes for, 'The Gilded Cage', and hoping it would somehow improve as I continued to watch, but as it is now S2, episode five of eight, I fear this now shall not happen.All-in-all, everything about the show is too contrived, inauthentic, and for me, found lacking in many respects.Henry James it is not!",2
"Beautiful sets, stilted acting","Gorgeous sets and costumes, which I truly appreciate. Dialogue , plot are disappointing and the acting is absolutely wooden. I'm not sophisticated enough to thoroughly diagnose the problem. But boy, it's no Downton Abbey. I'm so disappointed.",3
"Poorly cast?","It might very well be good but I had to shut it down after the first episode. Some actors can pull off 1800's high society and some are really not believable. They seem uncomfortable in their own performances. That's where it lost me. Christine Baranski is one of the few that does a good job. The rest shall remain nameless...you'll know. I blame the casting director for this one.",3
"So far, so dull","When I saw that this was written, produced, and created by Julian Fellowes with Kelli O'hara, Audra McDonald and Christine Barinski in the cast I couldn't believe it. All of that is worth the price of admission alone. Unfortunately this show is so slow and really dull. From an American perspective talking about society, money, and arranged marriages all the time isn't nearly as interesting as when the Brits do it. There can never be another Downton, not saying this was trying to be but I've read some comparisons and this is nothing like Downton in my opinion. Downton Abbey wasn't boring, this is. I love period dramas so much I created an entire list with my favourites with almost a hundred titles. I say that to say that I know that most start of very slow as they introduce the characters and you eventually see where the story is going then eventually they take off and never let you down but this period drama is just boring. None of the characters are likeable or interesting to me and I'm 5 epsiodes in. Will this get better?",3
"So boring","Started off well and had high expectations seeing it's from the same writer as Downton Abbey. 5 episodes in and nothing has really happened, no character development, no real story likes. Just rich women of society competing with one another to make a better name of themselves.So so boring I will not be watching any more episodes! Beautiful set and costumes, such a shame about the writing, wooden acting and lack of plot.",1
"A Disappointment","Considering cast, writer/producer I found this series a disappointment. Starting with the storyline which was somewhat convoluted, sets were painfully obvious at times and dialog appeared forced. Characters were unlikeable for the most part.In short, this effort is not in anyway on a par with Downton Abbey.",5
"Central Characters are ""off""","The sets and costumes are stunning. The plot lines are fairly interesting. The problem is that the main characters, particularly Carrie Coon's character, is just boring and unlikable. For a series to really have an impact, we have to be able to be interested in, and even care, about what happens to the main characters. Carrie Coon's character, probably owing to poor writing, engenders indifference.",5
"Who are the good guys?","I'm struggling to figure out who the good people are in the show. We're supposed to believe that the main protagonist is sweet and kind but she comes off as hard, defiant, and ungrateful. The one aunt is sweet and arguably the best actress in the show but she can't carry it alone. The actress playing Bertha is so annoying she's unwatchable. Overall, I'm very disappointed in Julian Fellowes, I expected more from him. He must have farmed out this project to amateurs. I gave it one extra star for the beautiful consumes and sets. Unwatchable.",2
"What a disappointment! HBO could do better","I'm a huge fan of high-quality historical pieces that are produced in the UK (like Downton Abbey), but this series is shockingly bad, which is surprising for an HBO show. I'm a big fan of Gilded Age history and the homes and the tycoons who built them, so I'd been looking forward to this show for over a year, only to be incredibly disappointed by the dismal result.The good: the period costumes and the phenomenal real-life mansions are visually stunning, and Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon are very good in their roles as sisters.The bad: everything else. The acting is stiff and wooden (especially by Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector as the Russell couple), the script is dull and predictable, the forced ""woke"" aspects are unnecessary, and the pace is slow and boring. Even the background music is cheesy. I'm truly perplexed and appalled that HBO could have created something this bad and I can't believe it's been renewed for a 2nd season.My advice: skip it and instead watch the plethora of high quality, UK-produced period dramas that are available on Amazon Prime Video.",3
"After two episodes, grossly disappointing and lacking in substance.","Admission: I love costume dramas and can overlook many things. This series lacks depth and substance. No amount of gorgeous costuming or cinematography is going to help the plotlines and dialog which are akin to lukewarm bland soup - anticipated greatly upon appearances but falls flat upon experiencing. Christine Baranski is utterly wasted here. Cynthia Nixon does an admiral job but sadly flounders with such pathetic and stilted dialog. Lastly, I am disillusioned with Louisa Jacobson's empty delivery. The one bright spot in this pabulum of characters is Carrie Coon as Bertha Russell whose take-no-prisoners persona shines! I will continue watching in the hopes that it may improve. I won't hold my breath.",3
"gilded age of snobbery, viciousness and insufferable characters","Five episodes.... That's as much as I could stand... The characters are insufferable. The take on history REALLY inaccurate. Everything is so clean and ""perfect"" and FAKE. Perfect teeth, perfectly plastic faces, perfect makeup, perfect interiors.... In a world where horses were the main means of getting around, every street is perfectly clean? Seriously? Stories are predictable.... And frankly, this type of telling of the lives of the rich and disconnected is stomach-turning and unrelatable... .There wasn't ONE character that I could root for success in their ventures. This show only serves to reinforce the reasons that the rich and privileged were despised and reviled by other classes in cities around the growing US. IMO, it's not a story worth telling in the first place and one that is horribly told in this one-dimensional plastic everything series. The characters lack complexity, everything is one-sided. The air-headed, vindictive female characters are actually obnoxious.2-stars only because of the faithful recreation of the buildings and their interiors (I'm a NYC resident and am familiar with many of the buildings portrayed and their owners' faithful to period interior designs and furnishings).Unwatchable show for me.",2
"Disappointing Wannabe","I'm talking about the second season, so I have tried! This is no Downton Abbey. There is so little character development...or is it just that there are no characters worth our time? All the characters are either cartoonishly over the top or boring beyond belief. There is very little to care about with these people. Even the clothes seem ""off"". They are also cartoonishly over the top...garishly so. Is the idea (Fellowes, I'm looking at you!) that ALL Americans are so nouveau, even the old guard, that they can't help but dress that way? I figured that it might settle down and find its way in the second season but it's hard to watch still.",5
"Unnatural interactions","The show is not even in the same ballpark as Downtin Abbey. It's slightly entertaining and most of the actors are okay. The portrayal of Mrs. Russell by Carri Coon is awful. Her lines seem very rushed and unnatural and the inflections in her voice is very flat. Please get her a vocal coach.",2
"Ridiculous","This show is really great! All you have to do is look past the followinWriting: So obvious and so on-the-nose - and in the case of the words put in the mouths of the cardboard characters played by Christine Baranski (old money good! New money bad!) and Carrie Coons (new money good! Old money bad!), beyond painful. Who'd have thought it possible to feel *embarrassed* for those two acting powerhouses?Continuity: I'd been wondering when, precisely, the story was set, until episode 2, when Mr. Raikes shows off his knowledge that Central Park's Bethesda Fountain was almost ten years old-thus placing the action in 1873 or 1874. Imagine my surprise, then, when a character in episode 3, which takes place mere days after the conclusion of ep 2, refers to Chester Alan Arthur--who was in office from 1881 to 1885--as the president. Who knew that time travel was a hallmark of the Gilded Age?Utter pointlessness/greed: All I can imagine was that someone -- I'm looking at you, Julian Fellowes -- thought that what the world (or his own bank account) needed was a Downton Abbey without the charm, opulence, subtlety, or accents of the original, even as the second theatrical sequel of DA was about to be released.Enjoy!",3
"It's no Downton Abbey","Not sure how this show warrants such high praise. I will admit that the sets and the costumes are beautiful, but there's not much to say after that. There is nothing appealing, sympathetic or even interesting about the characters, who are a bunch of boring, uptight, pretentious snobs. They don't have the depth or complexity that the characters had on Downton Abbey that made that show much more engaging than this one. That's pretty much the gist of my review, but since it requires 165 more characters, I will say that it's a shame that so much talent went into this production and that it ended up being less than the sum of its parts. I like Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector, and hope to see them in better shows in the future.",5
"You're kidding.","It's hard to believe this is Julian Fellowes baby. Stilted acting, CGI streetscapes, corny dialogue, cartoon characterizations, predictable plot development...etc. Etc. But mainly, for me, is the inexplicable lusterless direction. Unlike Downton Abbey, the direction and filming is completely without atmosphere. It looks like and maybe is a taped production converted to film. There is no grit, no substance. It looks like it was filmed during the first dress rehearsal. (subtleties and nuances to be added later). Poor Julian.",3
"Nope","Particularly, the acting. Wooden and 2 dimensional, to the extreme. I did trust Julian, that the actors would relax into their parts as the show went on. Nope. Thinking - is this really the way these people ""acted"" during this period? No. Now that I think of it it's the Russells I am referring to. The others are mediocre, but the Russells are pathetic. For me, they destroy the whole thing.",5
"Good grief!!","This whole show is ridiculous and delivered like a precise table read on a rushing like a stopwatch! Overacted- and badly. Every actor is misdirected to punch every line. Carrie Coon and Morgan Specter are in way over their heads. I tried but I cannot stomach this tripe further! Bu-bye.",3
"Well, I started it...I guess I'll have to finish it.","A lot of reviewers talked of Downton Abbey and comparisons between the two...SO I'M GONNA DO IT TOO! I tried to think of words that defined Downton that could not be found in Gilded Age. One word was ""natural"". Others were ""gritty and authentic and captivating"". It just didn't seem like the same exquisite detail went in to Gilded. I was not swept away to the era and anxiously waiting for the next episode. You were pulled into Downton. There were a few times just in the first episode where I teared up. WTH show is capable of that?? Sadly, not Gilded Age. Nice try Julian but this was written on the threadbare tails of Downton and it has barely held on.",3
"the best argument for nuclear war...","If this is considered something we should watch now and people think it good/great/subtle/humorous - beyond slavery, genocide, endless war, I think we are doomed.Really good actors mouthing crap lines in boxy, huge interiors, and CGI exteriors, it's like watching a bad puppet show with nicely dressed puppets.",2
"Terrible excuse of a period drama","Fellowes seems content with degrading himself for the monetary compensation. He is not a particularly impressive storyteller, we all know that, but this is low, even for him. (Hard to believe that HBO did this, it feels more like a lifetime production.)Downton Abbey, for the soap it was, had a place. This show, however, lacks any substance -whatsoever, the plot is boring and unrealistic, so are the characters (flat as can be), who at random have to double as cheap, cartoonish comic relief, and never show any depth which might spark some interest in them, or their journey. The tone is generally off-putting, seeking to mock the core elements of period drama, for the sake of ""freshening up"" the genre, I gather. The whole series reeks of major editorial interference to the detriment of the true potential the original idea might have had.Inconsistencies and far fetched conclusions that don't actually make sense, a plot that simply cannot be taken seriously.It gets worse throughout the series.Projects like this make one wonder how americans aren't offended by the patronisingly stuped remakes they get. Are you actually satisfied with dumbed down, cheap rip-offs of shows you have watched ten years ago?",2
"ALL WRONG","I never write reviews... but this one pissed me off. I'm a professional in antique and vintage jewelry. Almost ALL the jewelry in the show is NOT era appropriate, but from the 1950s and 60s.Season two has Oscar Wilde appear. He was an IRISH playwright. But in this series he speaks with an English accent. So if you are looking for an actual period piece, this is not it. It's sham. It's clothing seems accurate and the men's jewelry seems more era relevant, but the women's jewelry is NOT. The earrings on the splash screen for the series is 1960s Hobe costume. So many more infringements!!!! Too many to mention, but a simple google search or reaching out to professionals like me would save the cringe I feel.",3
"Cliched and tedious","Awfully done story line by actors wearing costumes that border on the ludicrous. Skip this! A waste of time! Such a waste of a talented cast. The settings are nicely done and the opulence is over the top as is the plot.",3
"Cast pales in comparison to that of Downton Abbey","Well, I couldn't even finish the first episode. Too much static rapid-fire delivery of lines, a total lack of chemistry between actors and too often just plain sub-par acting. There's not even hint of brilliance as there was with the entire cast of Downton Abbey. I find it to be such a waste because the gilded age in New York and Philadelphia society is absolutely fascinating. Added to that is the re-created buildings where everything appears to just be a set. I know there must be gorgeous architectural examples that could have been used for authenticity, just as Downton Abbey was used. I a word, disappointing.",4
"Doesn't have the charm of Downton Abbey","I was so exited when I saw the listing of this show. And when I saw that Christine Baranski was going to be in it, I thought she would add some wit and snarky comments like Maggie Smith. But oh man after 3 episodes I am done. The acting seems really forced. The story is boring and dull. I haven't been able to relate to the characters except to cringe whenever I hear Mrs. Russell talk. I guess I would rather live in Downton Abbey than New York City. The one neat thing was showing the Lady Liberty hand holding the torch.The show might make a couple seasons but I doubt it will have the following of DA.",3
"This is no Downtown Abbey","The brilliance of Downton Abbey bares no resemblance to this cheap imitation. Not sure if it's due to writing or acting, but I felt no engagement with any of the characters. Lots of unpleasant people, just being unpleasant and over the top. Perhaps written for the American market.",5
"Terrible over acting and storylines which drag on.","I really, really wanted to like this series. This was one of the times in history I would love to experience ... and I was hoping this show might transport me back to this era. It does, somewhat, in an over the top CGI of NYC during the golden age kind of way. The acting is so bad and over the top, often I feel as though I am watching actors reading from a script or acting in a community theater play.Nobody is believable, or likeable. Having said that ... if you like Downton Abby, you'll like this. It has the exact same vibe, writing/banter and similar characters even. Situationally, we split our time between the lowly help and the privledged elite. Of course there are lots of queer and diverse folks woven into the plots as well, whom we see are persecuted and slighted throughout the show. The show jabs the viewers with constant reminders of white privledge ... lest you are able to escape it while watching tv.The Downton playbook is followed almost letter by letter. There are lots of secrets ... tension created by those secrets ... and vile, unlikable characters whom mix and mingle with the incurable optimist goody two shoes characters. Each play their one note parts as if our of the stage play My Fair Lady, as to say with a cloying hammy aplomb. At times, I halfway expect the young-and-in-love characters to break into song.The scenery and outfits were likely an investment made that consumed the budget. While many of the street scenes are CGI, the actual sets are beyond lavish and faithful recreations of what I would imagine the vintage reality to be. This is a thing to be thankful for as the storylines are so slow and rambling that at least the viewer can escape by chewing on the scenery.This is a mess of a period piece and honestly, I am amazed it was renewed for a second season. The writing is as trite as the acting is sickly sweet. Everything is fairly predictable and the one-note characters lack depth or realism. Again ... imagine Downton Abby without the likability and you have Golden Age. Oh how I wanted this review to be different but it feels like a chore watching these episodes.",3
"Inaccurate History line S02E07","I enjoy viewing the series on an overall basis, the series is a decent time waster.......what I do not like is the way that Julian Fellowes has rewritten history,With regards to the Brooklyn bridge....yes it was completed in 1883, yes the night it was celebrated with fireworks is accurate......what is NOT accurate is the fact that architect (who designed the bridge) John Roebling didn't live to see the completion of the bridge. He died in 1869, 14 years before the bridge was completed...........but his character appears in episode 7 alongside his wife (Emily) alive & well.....I think that Fellowes needs to go back to history class in high school & do a refresher course on American history.....what a stupendous blooper.",5
"Upper Crust Americans with a Grudge and an Axe to Grind","Hmmm...I've read about fifty reviews of this show so far, and last night I finished Episode Two. The reviews aren't positive...do I take on the reviewers for what they expected of this show or do I critique the show itself? How about a little of both, as they do seem to butt heads just like the characters in this show.Dear Julian Fellowes lovers: Get over it. Yes, it's not Downton Abbey. It is HBO's version (and you know what that means and what that brings) of a Pseudo-Wharton NY. Don't watch if you don't like it. Quit giving this show ratings of 1 or 2.Yes, it feels stilted. Yes, it sounds clipped. Did you live in that era? Do you have first-hand knowledge of how they sounded back then? Granted, they are using many Broadway people (and all that that entails), and lets face it, Broadway people don't always translate to TV, let alone HBO. But just enjoy it for what it's supposed to portray - don't foist your demands upon this show.Christine Baranski is being used for who she is adored for portraying - a smug uptight rich bitch (see her episode as Dr. Nora on Frasier and you'll see what I mean). Carrie Coon is being played against type (see her in Leftovers, an 11 out of 10 show on HBO, or in Fargo, a superlative show on FX) as the new bitch in town. Let this simmer and see what it brings.What I will admit is that by the second episode, I was getting the hang of what was unfolding. Usually when that happens it means the plot is too simple. But as some have pointed out, I watch TV (and HBO) for many reasons, so if this is simple to follow then why not indulge in it? After all, don't we watch sitcoms for the silliness?I'd like to end with putting down the reviewers here who just don't want to see things like class/race struggles, civil rights issues, and women's rights issues. And especially the reviewer who couldn't stand seeing two men having sex""...for God's sake, the two men kissed and fell onto a bed! That was IT. You have a problem with THAT? You people who want to diss a show that doesn't conform to your wants and expectations and how you view life should stop writing reviews - because those aren't reviews you're writing, those are diatribes against understanding humanity in all of it's ugliness and messiness, not to mention missing critical thinking skills.",5
"Great sets","And I am a lover of period drama and the sets and costuming on the show are excellent. The acting, however is rather sub-par and not what you would expect for a Fellowes' drama, or from the BBC. As I understand the series has been given a nod for Season 2 perhaps we can look forward to improved acting.",3
"Good actors calling in their lines, unlikable characters, disappointing.","If you close your eyes it sounds like most of the actors are reading from a script for the first time. Or like the voice prompter off stage. The voices are almost monotone. Surprisingly, the worst is Louisa Jacobson (Meryl Streep's daughter) I'm sorry to say. The only two approachable characters with any personality are Cynthia Nixon's and Denée Benton's. Christine Baranski's character is bizarrely unbelievable. I keep waiting for her usual warmth and wit but the character is stiff and unfunny. Morgan Spector's character is unlikable, and Carrie Coon's character is horrible. These actors whom I usually like do not shine here at all. How is it possible these respected actors can't make me like the characters they are portraying? Bad directing?",5
"Ornamental at best.","For some reason I'm still watching this show, perhaps being an optimist I'm still hoping that something is actually going to happen.As a lover of Austen and of Downtown Abbey and of period dramas I find this one rather underwhelming. Alas I've watched enough to be somewhat attached to these characters so I'll stick it out till the bitter end.",5
"I keep watching...","I keep wanting it to get better so I keep watching. It's less like the cast is acting like actual characters. Instead they are acting like actors in old movies who are playing these characters. It is so over the top that it has to be intentional but it makes it hard to watch at times. I'm starting to think maybe it's a comedy?",4
"There's no story","Is this one if the shows without any story in it? It's so boring to watch and not really understand what's it all about. I don't know, maybe Americans understand it??? What I got from the show is that they keep on heaving parties and that's all.I have watched through 1,5 seasons and the only cool thing I saw was Edison moment and that's it.And yeah, forgot... the only interesting part was to watch how Black people used to struggle and I've felt very bad for them.Boring, boring, boring... don't watch it, seriously. It doesn't deserve 8 stars but 2,just because the music is nice. It's dull.",2
"Terribly directed start but worth persevering","The opening episode is almost farcical the way so much is packed in. It gets better as the plot lines get embedded and you understand the pressure the director was under when you find out it's only a four part series. Why? Th e producers have risked overall success by trying to rush and condense it, many might not go beyond episode one because I'd it and that would be a shame.",3
"Laughing out loud who could rate it higher than 4","Historically the show is ridiculously bad. Nothing resembles the period of that time .Also the acting is ridiculously poor, but the costumes and decor are great.As many have stated previously, it's a lame copy of ""Downton Abbey,"" a poor attempt to recreate the same concept but in different circumstances. Why? Americans don't need royalty . You can't buy it with cash . And they shouldn't. Americans are a proud nation of immigrants who have ambitions and may achieve their dreams regardless their birth ( generally speaking) . Why to create this fake narrative of royalty ? European aristocracy always looked down at American rich no matter how many generations NY elite resided in NY. It a fact . Marriages between Europe aristocratic name with no funds and American new money were accepted but no more .I don't expect much historical accuracy from shows and movies, but one has to stick to at least some decent level of it. It's laughable. It's imaginary, marke it as fantasy plsThe past we want to have been like that (hint: it had never been like that, read a book on the period).Dialogues, characters, storylines - Latin Soap. But the costumes and overall attention to detail, no matter how imaginative they are, were really fun.If you want to kill your time with a ridiculous soap opera in great costumes and you have never read anything about that historical period, you might like it.",3
"Choose another actress","Carrie Coon sounds like she reading from cue cards. Her acting is flat and too quick for her character to have thought of her quips off the cuff. So bad.",4
"A waste of film","That's right: The Gilded Age, HBO's glittering period drama that looks as if it cost as much to make as an Upper East Side mansion, is back for a second season more than 18 months after its debut left me and countless others interminably bored. The first season of the series, which promised to be an even more extravagant version of Fellowes' masterpiece Downton Abbey-only this time chronicling the lives of the uber-rich (and their servants) in 1880s New York City, rather than post-Edwardian England-should have been a slam-dunk. With a stacked cast that felt like a gay man's fever dream-Carrie Coon! Christine Baranski! Cynthia Nixon! Audra McDonald! Nathan Lane! Jeanne Tripplehorn! Debra Monk! Donna Murphy! Celia Keenan-Bolger!-The Gilded Age was supposed to be a juicy soap opera about the fierce battle between New York's old money and its new. But to call it a soap opera would be to suggest that something-anything-happened. It was, to put it rudely, a total snooze. (Emmy voters evidently agreed with this assessment, largely snubbing the series save for a singular nomination for production design.)",1
"Still trying to figure out how this has an 8 star rating!","I can honestly say that I am a huge fan of Downton Abbey. I also enjoyed Belgravia (both seasons) but I honestly have no idea how this was greenlit for a single season, let alone THREE. I have watched both currently available seasons in their entirety and was so insanely bored throughout! First off, Marian, is actually intolerable. Her character is very apparently supposed to be a Lady Mary wannabe, but she doesn't even come close to being as interesting. She comes off as selfish and incredibly self absorbed with no redeemable qualities, whatsoever. Especially after her second season arc of leading on a grieving widowed father only to toss him aside when he actually asks her to marry him. Then we have The Russells. I assume we are supposed to root for them as new money 'underdogs' forcing their way into high society but honestly, I can only see them as two bullies who thrive off of screwing over everyone around them. I don't know why anyone would root for them when they don't have any likable qualities and don't seem to care who they hurt or how they get where they're going. There is no backstory to support how they became so cruel and flippant about other people to even make them interesting. They just are who they are and they pretty much have no loyalty to anyone but themselves. In fact, they thrive off of making everything about them in the worst possible way. I actually hate them. And not in a love to hate them kind of way. (I used to love to hate Victoria and Conrad on Revenge for example.) If they had been written properly they might be interesting to hate like Mrs. Obrien and Thomas were for example, but nothing about them is even remotely entertaining. If they can't get their way they bully, pay off, or threaten whomever is in their way until they 'win'. They both repeatedly screw over their own children just to get their way, too, which I think is why I truly hate them. They don't even seem to care about their own kids happiness. It's literally ALWAYS about them. Then we have Peggy Scott. I was looking forward to her storyline because I thought of all the ways they could incorporate the black side of America in the 1880's not long after the civil war. Her storyline is so boring and so contrived that it's actually ridiculous. They make a big deal of her having all these secrets only to reveal the most obvious one of all. She had a child with a husband. -gasp; Then, they make a big deal out of trying to find her supposedly 'dead' son whom didn't actually die--'double gasp; only to start the second season with him conveniently having died so they can throw her character into all of the most cliche stereotypes of traveling to the south and being mistreated by white men. The usual crap with no depth at all. All the way around her whole storyline has been incredibly boring and unbelievable on astronomical scales. I think most believable of all was in season one where she decided not to take a high paying newspaper job because they wouldn't let her claim it in public. No black female would have turned down a job at a newspaper in that era. They wouldn't have even dreamed of giving that up! After that I couldn't get behind her character. Not at all. I literally missed whole chunks of what was going on throughout this show because of how bored I was. No storyline was gripping. Not one of them was unpredictable. I have never seen anything this bad in my life. I'm not even kidding! I was shocked that Julian Fellowes created such a boring show! Even at its worst moments, Downton Abbey was NEVER boring. I always wanted to know what was going to happen next. With this one I just couldn't wait for it to be over! Do not waste your time. I swear! It's not worth it!Another huge thing that I really can't understand is why this was given a TV-MA rating. When I think TV-MA there is plenty of swearing, sex scenes, violence, gore, ect. This has literally PG-13 (At most) content. There is only one scene (which feels super out of place to the rest of the show) where a woman is fully naked and showing her breasts. And one other scene where a man blows his brains out but all you see is a spatter of blood and hear a gunshot. Those are the only two scenes that even remotely scream TV-MA to me. At least if there were TV-MA content in this it might have been redeemable but it literally is not. It's more PG than Downton Abbey was.All in all, I don't know how anyone is seeing this as good, but it's not. And I am really baffled as to how this got renewed twice! I've seen way better shows on MAX get axed and not one of them was this boring af!",1
"An American story with British verbage","I'm not sure why there is such a profound quality difference between Downton and Gilded Age.I've enjoyed parts but overall it is greatly lacking the overall excellence that Downton had. Acting, directing and even writing.Mr. Fellowes seems to have forgotten that there are definite differences between British and American verbiage. The entire thing has been written with British verbiage... only without the accent. Not even in the late 1800's/early 1900's did American's speak in this way.While I just love British-speak, it does not suit/fit Americans.Anyhow, that has been pretty distracting for me.I give Downton a 10/10 but Gilded only a 4/10.",4

"Elegant but too modern and soapy","After almost the first full season I gave up. It felt like other than visual grandeur and mannerism (from the writers, not the actors), there was not much left of the era we are supposed to be witnessing.The writing is not completely bad: the main events - as far as my foreigner's understanding can tell - actually feel like you're in another age. Also nice here and there to be reminded of real historical characters and motivated to dig deeper in their stories.Unfortunately as soon as you look at the explorations of several social backgrounds, the witty dialogues, the details of the story lines and of the behaviours, you can easily tell that it's an anachronistic TV production made to cater to a certain audience (female especially) interested in a history-set drama.Many characters represent either comedy, moral or affective artificial relief to balance the events, which feels too orderly and fake.If that's what you're looking for, then it's more than fine. But if you're looking for some gritty history drama that's not afraid to delve with the reality of those times, you're wasting your time.Great costumes and scenographies though.",5
"New York Downton Abbey","I'm not mocking or criticizing in any way. It's hard to be as good as a beloved classic, but 'The Gilded Age' reached a similar level of quality. It is bolder, more vivid, more colorful, more sumptuous, and more straightforward. The relationship among characters is clearer and more dynamic. The structure, plot, and characters are similar. On the other hand, the style, the pace, the editing are Americanized. The plot unfolds fast, absorbing the audience and making them stay focused as well. At the same time, the series addresses social problems specific to the Gilded Age, some of which are still relevant and historic milestones in the blooming days of New York. Good balance between entertainment and message.",5
