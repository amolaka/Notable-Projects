"Unlike many movie-to-series adaptations, this one doesn’t just demonstrate an understanding of how the medium works; it actually improves upon the source material.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It does take some time for these two actors to find their groove together, and for the show as a whole to demonstrate that it knows where it’s headed and what it wants to be.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Finding worthy replacements for Glover and Erskine will be a tall order, but so far, the show has successfully filled the Americans void in my heart.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The filming style is very, chic and sexy, with a hint of darkness and danger, which help build the tension in the romance and espionage. With likeable and relatable characters, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is sure to be a hit and might be a worthy award contender.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
This entertaining series really misses out on answering every question you may have.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a fun and exciting reimagining of the film’s concept, and thanks to the approach the writers, the actors, and the directors have given it, it feels like a concept that could go even beyond in a future season.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Mr. and Mrs. Smith tackles the intricacies of interracial relationships by showing us tough but open conversations.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Poised between dark humor and pulse-pumping action, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is so watchable that for most of its first season you may not notice it’s really not going anywhere. Or anyway it sometimes seems it’s going nowhere. Just wait until Episode 8.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"When Donald Glover flexes his genius muscle along with his team of cinematic savants, things get really interesting, and fast.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"There's an intimacy, a lived-in feel and hangout charm to this Mr & Mrs Smith... a series to commit to, embrace and relish.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Glover and Erskine are not Jolie and Pitt, and thank goodness for that. They are a new kind of pairing for a new generation, one that doesn’t need their heroes to be slick.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Instead of railing against these constraints, the show leans into them. John and Jane realize that their only real choice is learning how to live in full knowledge that their choices are illusionary.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Just as in the film, mundane everyday aspects of marriage are heightened by both John and Jane’s unfamiliarity with each other and their mutual professional obligations, which lead to some charming and thoroughly entertaining juxtapositions.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Mr. & Mrs. Smith is one of those rare examples in which the series adaptation is superior to the original film. [Full review in Spanish],Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Glover and Erskine are charming, good looking and essentially carry off their roles. I say essentially because the banter is so deadpan it often misses the comedic timing to keep it going.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Sure, no matter its pleasures, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is ultimately disposable entertainment with questionable morals. And its last episode features a couple of familiar cliches. Other than those blips, the show is one of the nicest surprises of the early year.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Whether you're drawn to spy thrillers or character-driven dramas, this modern take on a classic tale is worth the investment.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Honestly, 8 episodes is not enough for a show this good. We need more episodes of Donald Glover and Maya Erskine just hanging out together. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is such a TV treat.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Nonetheless, those wanting (or willing) to embrace a well-produced and fun contemporary spy series will find it entertaining.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Donald Glover and Maya Erskine star as spies-for-hire posing as husband and wife—and embody their generation’s emotional and economic malaise.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Overall, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a series that is made all the more interesting for its flaws.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
It’s as if you’re watching an experimental attempt to serialize an already-overlong indie art film and foist it on an unwary public.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It goes deep where you expect broad, makes the most of a lavish budget -- location shooting in Manhattan and northern Italy, a juicy supporting cast -- and always keeps the focus on the evolving relationship between its two protagonists.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"This Mr & Mrs Smith starts over from scratch with a completely new set-up. It behaves as if the original doesn’t exist. If there’s a lesson to be learned here, it’s that the best TV spin-offs are often those based on films that were nothing special.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"A good binge that should have been a compelling, thought-provoking series with a distinct vibe that would have given us something to mull over each week. It’s not. It’s just a well-made spy series that is fun to watch but leaves little lasting impression.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It’s slick and smart. Sometimes it gets a little talky, but then it quickly cuts back to the action -- interspersed with the droll comedy that Glover and Erskine are known for.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
The steady pace of the show helps explore the chemistry between the two leads.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
The way Mr. & Mrs. Smith wrestles with the idea of compatibility — that it’s real and able to be clearly determined despite the obstacles — makes this feel like a show about dating first and spying second.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The show belongs to Glover and Erskine, who play well together, in harmony and dissonance.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"With 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith', Prime Video reaches the perfect intersection between two avenues that it has put a lot of effort into exploring: that of prestige series and the action genre. [Full review in Spanish]",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Mr. & Mrs. Smith cleverly juxtaposes dating/marriage with spycraft and the action is high, but while the writing sings at times, at others something feels off-key",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It's kind of like married at first sight, except you're killing people.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"There’s decent chemistry between the pair but come on, the only reason to watch is this: are they going to get it on?",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Like much of Glover’s work, it deliberately doesn’t tell you where it’s going; it tiptoes up to jokes; it’s vaguely commitment-phobic. Who, or what, even is “the company”? But woarhh, the rest of it is crazy, unpredictable and very funny...",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Glover and Erskine have been masterful as outcasts in “Atlanta” and “Pen15,” here they bring that same tone to an espionage caper.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Whether it is the chemistry, the writing, or a combination of both, there is so much to love about our two leads. The final product is conventional, but this series is comforting and entertaining.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Eventually, MAMS loses momentum and starts looping through samey set pieces, becoming repetitive and padded. But for a fair while it’s entertaining.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Donald Glover and Maya Erskine might give solid performances in this reboot of the Brangelina spy romp, but a slow start and wasted cameos makes this incarnation somehow disappointing.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It’s like Prime Video watched Citadel — that colossal train-wreck starring Priyanka Chopra — go off the rails in real time, and resolved to rescue Mr & Mrs Smith from a similar fate.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Mr. and Mrs. Smith is the opposite of Bond’s disposable nature; there are no one-off girls and gadgets. It’s about two people who won’t (or can’t) leave each other and how that knowledge informs their relationship.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It wouldn’t work if the chemistry between Glover and Erskine didn’t work. But even in the early moments of the Smiths’ pairing, we can see them click, mainly because Glover and Erskine are working on similar comedic wavelengths.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Donald Glover, Maya Erskine and an impressive roster of guest stars deny us the details in this gorgeously photographed and well-acted series",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Glover demonstrates that his choices are not clumsy or whimsical: he turned a blockbuster with little more than an ingenious idea into a tragicomic, seductive series and at times, of vast dramatic power and emotional intensity. [Full review in Spanish]",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The intellectual detailing of the rife between the two infringes upon how swoony and sexy the series otherwise could be — there is romance here, but not the rosy, rom-com kind.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The series is stylish, cinematic and entertaining, with hooks waiting to snag you every time your attention starts to wander. But despite all that, it’s missing that indefinable spark that makes you fall in love.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"If the 2005 film relied on explosive star power, the new TV version works harder for its payoffs.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Mr & Mrs Smith is a lot better than it could be, but not half as good as it could be.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"A slow-burn series that’s smart and attentive to its characters’ psychological details, but it’s only fun in drips and drabs.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
One wonders how much better this would be if its makers were more insistent on seducing the audience with humor instead of searching for ways to dance around it.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"While the show is less successful in other aspects, one thing it nails is the relationship between Glover and Erskine’s John and Jane. They’ve got fantastic chemistry, and you completely become invested in their journey.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"I’m not sure if this quite worked as a Mr. and Mrs. Smith reimagining. It felt more like they forced two different shows into one, causing a clash that didn’t feel like time well spent. Paring down the time would've helped greatly.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
An Amazon series remake that somehow manages to feel both bold and boring while adhering to the same general log line. The result is arty and ambitious in a way that will likely be enjoyed very much by a very few.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It's... such a relief to watch a TV series that doesn’t strive for film-style plotting stretched over eight hours. There is some bumpiness in pacing and plotting, but Mr. & Mrs. Smith has a finely tuned sense of the world John and Jane are striving for.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"While a little too conventional at times and sputtering in places, “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” is far more compelling than your average reboot of an action flick. So long as you’re not expecting more of the same, it’s worth giving this couple a shot.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"By design and by the grace of its leads, the show can’t re-create the same sexual tension that was present in the movie. But that’s a good thing.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"With Glover and Erskine as great as they are, and with a story that's wonderfully self-assured in its own identity outside of the 2005 film, Mr. & Mrs. Smith makes for a darkly funny treat.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The expert crafting of superficial pleasures, plus distinctive chemistry and heartfelt exchanges between its leads helps Mr. & Mrs. Smith hone in on an elusive target.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"A great comedy-drama(?) that wisely mixes espionage and romance while subverting clichés, delves into themes such as a (fake) relationship, and where characters are masterfully played by the brilliant Erskine and Glover. [Full review in Spanish]",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"This isn't a rehearse of film, instead it takes a fresh & unique approach to telling this very large in scale action story but focuses on what its like to be in relationship. The chemistry between Glover and Erskine is phenomenal. This is a must watch!",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"“Mr. & Mrs. Smith” is a different, more emotive spin on the spy genre that will appeal to audiences looking for a sophisticated and sometimes exciting escape.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Donald Glover’s “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” series remake, which is, yes, comedic and funny, takes all its cues from imaging the story from an emotionally credible place. Because let’s face it, all bets are off when killers catch feelings.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It’s fun to see the talent involved, watch them interact with Glover and Erskine and wonder how the episodes will play out.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"There is charm to the weirdness. But at other points the stripped-down story verges on boring. And for me, the dull outweighed the interestingly quirky.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Unlike the film version, these Smiths aren't pristine models. No, they are regular people with trust issues who are embracing a roller coaster of risk to start building a nest egg for incomplete dreams.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It’s smart, well-acted and involving, but the constant squabbling between these main characters in “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” gets pretty tiring afterwhile.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
White-hot romance and thrilling action.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
The series builds something different on the sturdy foundation established by the film.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Mr. & Mrs. Smith may not be a classic like Atlanta, but it can be a whole lot of fun.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"There are countless whys orbiting the narrative planet. The writing and acting, however, are such that you believe in the people, if not necessarily their situation.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Erskine is fantastic in this, making a sizzling pair with Glover in a funny, breezy reimagining that’s half action-packed spy games and half cute rom-com, and equally adept at both halves.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"In time, maybe this version of Mr & Mrs Smith will come to be the defining one. It certainly deserves to be.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"For a show about two superspies, based on a nonsensical Brangelina thriller, it is remarkable for its honest, relatable depiction of a relationship between two disaffected millennials.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It cleverly inverts the movie’s premise. It blends the best elements of retro TV and modern TV, and deftly balances the ridiculousness of the core idea with the danger of it.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The series has a texture and tone all its own, akin to Glover’s surreal dramedy Atlanta. It’s a singular story that’s as sexy as it is mysterious.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"In a TV landscape filled with rip-offs and repeats, Mr. & Mrs. Smith forms its own (secret) identity.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Adapting its premise to the series format, it changes the focus from action and comedy to developing its characters and life as a couple. Maya Erskine and Donald Glover genuinely humanize the spies [Full Review in Spanish]",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Whether it’s the show’s ability to draw out their relationship or Glover and Erskine’s chemistry, I don’t know, but I became instantly invested in how John and Jane interact with each other more than I ever did with the film.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Glover and Erskine make a good pair of leads and a good pairing. They’re not 1,000-watt stars like Pitt and Jolie, and the absence of glamor makes their relationship more relatable.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Donald Glover delivers high thrills and high comedy with a series that's as much about intimacy as it is about espionage.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It is almost a shame that Mr. & Mrs. Smith is tied to the original film so obviously. The show is light years more interesting, involving, and clever.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Glover and Erskine’s alluring rapport is the reason to come to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, but it’s also the show’s adhesive.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
It's a frustrating waste of both its talented leads and even more talented guest stars. Mr. and Mrs. Smith might have found greater success if it had leaned into the comedic potential of a marriage thrown together by extraordinary circumstances.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Mr. & Mrs. Smith attempts to be an intellectual commentary on marriage but ends up dull, predictable, and tedious.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"If you’re expecting the movie with Brad and Angie recast, this is not that. It’s turned something light and silly into a show that’s dark, smart, and hard to categorise.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Glover and Erskine’s amazing chemistry is what makes it all work.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
The question that supersedes will they or won't they is: Why should we care?,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It’s a cliche to joke about how relationship drama can seem like a matter of life and death, but it can really feel that way, and exploring that dynamic with literal bullets flying overhead proves meaty enough for more than one season of television.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
A fresh and intellectual take on the 2005 movie that’s fun and relatable. Glover and Erskine are both fabulous. Using spy missions as a metaphor for relationships proves to be fascinating. A great binge watch!,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"A remarkably easy watch, a fun piece of comfort food programming that alternates unpredictable mystery-of-the-week plotting with increasingly likable characters.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Mr. and Mrs. Smith is must watch Television,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Simply put, “Mr & Mrs. Smith” is the first must-see show of 2024.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The show’s focus on their relationship, and attempts to keep it together, instead of on spy work gives the series a different spin but also creates its own challenge in keeping the material fun.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Mr. & Mrs. Smith proves that you can reboot something and end up making a completely new and unique creation that not only stands on its own merit, but excels",Rotten Tomatoes,,
The Donald Glover and Fransesca Stone adaptation could be called Mr. & Mrs. Smith: An Anatomy of a Fall from a Marriage. Their Prime Video series is a thoughtful high-wire act for a new generation.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"“Mr. & Mrs. Smith” left plenty on the table when it left multiplexes nearly 20 years ago, and a new television series makes a convincing case the film’s concept has always been better suited for another medium entirely.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Mr. & Mrs. Smith is DAMN GOOD TELEVISION and Prime Video’s best series yet. A smart and refreshing take on the 2005 film with sexy and sophisticated performances from Donald Glover & Maya Erskine.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The results feel surprisingly fresh, because show creators Francesca Sloane and Donald Glover have eschewed the easy option – a dumb action thriller – in favour of something wittier and more thoughtful.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Familiar and slight though the set-up may be, the series rarely feels contrived or stale thanks to the show’s breezy screwball energy and a pair of charming performances by Glover and Erskine, who exude an effortless, effervescent chemistry.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The series subverts the crime thriller and rom-com genres, taking a look at the reality behind the spectacle of espionage, the mundane moments post-mission when all they want to do is take off their shoes, wash off the blood, and watch cartoons.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"What a delight to watch something smart and deeply felt that's also so fizzy and funny. And on top of that, it's stylish and great-looking.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Donald Glover and Maya Erskine’s wonderful chemistry isn’t enough to save this erratic series.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a sizably entertaining and meditative spy thriller fit for a millennial demographic.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Chock full of great music and one of the coolest on-screen apartments/homes in recent memory, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is the definitive spy-romcom/relationship drama and is a solid binge-watch this weekend.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It’s sometimes more of a hangout show, with people existing and talking. Mr. & Mrs. Smith is in no artificial rush. It’s not constructed to make you feel the thrills—instead, it’s designed to explore the characters and the moments in between.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Maya Erskine and Donald Glover shine both together and individually in this spy thriller meets rom com, which reimagines the film in a unique and fun way.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"[Mr. & Mrs. Smith is] your average, run-of-the-mill soap opera with some mild action [...] with the dialogues either sounding like they’ve been improvised on the spot or like one of those unnecessarily dark and serious SNL parodies.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The writing is smart, the performances are great, and the characters are interesting – not likeable, not by a long shot, but with enough complexity and oomph to keep you fully invested in their journey.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"A successful marriage of action-thriller and mumblecore romcom, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' skips the movie adaptation curse thanks to its laidback charm, effective comedy, and the exceptional chemistry of its leads.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Prime Video's Mr. & Mrs. Smith has fun thanks to its winning leads, Donald Glover and Maya Erskine, though its pacing raises some eyebrows.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It is fast, fun and witty. Care has been taken with every aspect.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Whatever it is, It’s worth a watch, but it might not check everyone’s boxes. I do hope people accept it on its own merits and don’t compare it to the film too much.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Fueled by nimble writing and the natural chemistry of its two leads, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is the (very) rare reboot that both evolves and honors the original.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Glover and Erskine are the duo you didn’t know you needed, and soon, the couple you won’t be able to get enough of in this show.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Like the original Mr. & Mrs. Smith, it's a product of its time: Rather than schlock and awe, it aims for restraint and wit.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Mr. & Mrs. Smith has its delights, with a plot that sends the duo on glamorous top-secret missions to one picturesque location after another. But it’s all built on the wobbly foundation of a romance that’s more interesting in theory than in practice.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Amazon's Mr. & Mrs. Smith series starring Donald Glover and Maya Erskine cleverly reworks the original movie’s spy fantasy into a layered drama about relationships.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Glover and Erskine bring an inescapable warmth to their pairing of supposed cold-blooded killers. Although they lack Pitt and Jolie’s action chops, they get the job done, their moves all the more believable for their lack of slickness.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"You can tell Mr. & Mrs. Smith was created by Donald Glover because it has the same feel as Atlanta. They shouldn't have called this Mr. & Mrs. Smith though. I think that's why some people left negative reviews because it doesn't resemble the movie at all. I think the people who didn't like it would've liked it more if they called it something else because they went into it expecting the story to be along the same lines of the movie. It's not. It doesn't make it bad though. Both Donald Glover and Maya Erksine were fantastic in this. They have such natural chemistry. This show has plenty of drama, action, comedy, etc to keep you entertained.",IMDB,Will keep you entertained,8.0
"I had an absolute blast watching Mr. & Mrs. Smith. I just binged all 8 episodes over the weekend and it was such a fun show it flew by. This is both a good spy thriller and a good rom-com. Donald Glover and Maya Erksine are both terrific as the leads and every episode has guest stars from other well known actors. It had Alexander Skarsgard, Eiza Gonzalez, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Ron Perlman, Ursula Corbero, Sarah Paulson, Wagner Moura, Parker Posey, among others. Each episode was a different adventure and they were all fun to watch. Glover and Erksine star as John and Jane Smith. Two loners who are put together to work as spies for a mysterious organization.",IMDB,Looking forward to next season,8.0
"Did I feel like some parts are boring , yes but overall I liked the story and progression. Not sure why anyone thought it was supposed to be a remake of the movie lol it's a series. Structure is completely different so whoever is comparing it to the over the top unrealistic action scenes from the movie already set themselves up for failure. Donald glover is an amazing talent and I was shockingly attracted to him the entire movie even though I have been listening to him for years and never felt that for him lol so I guess Im smitten with the way the character was written. I liked them both individually, my only gripe is I don't believe the characters fell for eachother, even during the makeout/sex scenes, it seems like they're just friends who might as well sleep together because theyre supposed to keep the real reason theyre together a secret. They had chemistry but not sexual chemistry. I look forward to the expansion of the story, maybe with new characters mixed in with appearances from the s1 characters. Idk I'm not a writer so what do I know.",IMDB,I enjoyed it,8.0
"Terrific chemistry, excellent writing, I loved the concept, and I simply couldn't get enough. Donald Glover continues to impress as an actor, a writer, and a showrunner (and his partnership with Hiro Murai continues to blow me away). I think a lot of people were put off by thinking this is a reboot or sequel to the 2005 movie and I have to emphasize that it is NOT. It is a complete reimagining of the concept. And it blew me away. I'd also add that the little details, the Easter eggs, the set design, and the wardrobe was STUNNING. This was a show made with care, meticulously crafted around a couple of acting powerhouses. If you're on the fence about this show, go ahead and give it a try. I have a feeling you'll be happily surprised.",IMDB,Absolutely loved it,10.0
"A wonderfully acted spy action series with two interesting leads and one that I liked very much and that was Jane ""the Robot"", under her ice-cold fish face she was such a joy to listen to her speaking, flawless accent, grunts and ""growls"" and see her running and fighting like her bobo was on fire.Had the shows' script and plots were on par with the acting, gorgeous scenes and more than good visual effects, it would have blasted the ""shuup"" out of that lovely truth serum.I love how Jane laughs and how John softly speaks!

"Season 2 please! Prime Video please to renew this! Francesca Sloan & Donald Glover are a very trustworthy team that will not disappoint. Maya Erskine is a phenomenal actress. This show could be her breakout role! If Mr. & Mrs. Smith season 2 materializes, it promises to elevate the excitement and surprises to new heights. The first season masterfully blended spy action, love stories, and a compelling mystery, ensuring a rollercoaster ride for its dedicated audience. Fans of intense drama eagerly await official confirmation while relishing the opportunity to revisit the captivating world of Mr. & Mrs. Smith on Amazon Prime Video.",IMDB,I'm just waiting for season 2,10.0
"I fell victim to the marketing ploys of this show and was excited for this show to be released, watching most of the series the day it was released.It is well made and had a good production value. Well shot and for the most part well acted. But I find the subject matter to be dull and the writing to be a bit lazy.This is a spy show that is missing all of the quintessential ""spy things"" found in the genre. First off, the characters are basically Craigslist Kirkland-brand spies. They are not very good at their jobs and they are following the orders of a chat-GTP style entity. Also, the series is episodic, so they are in a new location doing a new task every episode. This is okay, but 90% of the episode is spent examining their relationship, while 10% is spent doing a few spy things.All of the realism in this show is spent on relationship building. It's like a committee sat down and wrote a standard rom com using fights, quirks, and highlights from all of their previous relationships and packages them into a show. Needing a hook, they threw in a few lazily-written spy scenes to match it watchable.I'm being a bit harsh here. The series is somewhat enjoyable and the relationship scenes are pretty well executed and well thought out. But if you are looking for an espionage/spy show with any sort of realism, this isn't it. This is a show about the fake marriage between two people that just happen to be spies.",IMDB,Somewhat Interesting But Ultimately Falls Flat,6.0
"Better than I expected. Great writing, direction, music, and imagery, but its biggest win is the chemistry between Donald Glover and Maya Erskine. Their chemistry is electric and cozy at the same time. They make you root for them, invest in them, and want to see so much more of them.This show revels in the small, in-between moments. It shines when John and Jane are just being together. Whether they are laughing over annoying party guests or arguing over what constitutes emotional cheating. Through their ups and downs there is always an undercurrent of deep love and reverence towards one another. They want to be together even when it seems like they don't work anymore.While the spy aspect is second or third to the relationship, always, they've built enough of a foundation to make the lore interesting.I can't rave about this show enough. It's been an over a month since I binged all eight episodes and it has stayed with me. It's my favorite show of 2024 so far and I know by the end of the year it will at minimum be in my top 3 of the year.Give it a shot. It's not a remake of the movie. It's a reimagining with a focus on the minutiae instead of the bang bang explosions.Donald Glover is a genius and Maya Erskine is a revelation.",IMDB,Trading sexy for intimacy,10.0
"John Smith (Donald Glover) and Jane Smith (Maya Erskine) become Mr and Mrs Smith working for a Spy company as a (arranged) married couple who go on spy missions.To be clear this Is not the Pitt/Jolie Smiths, but, in time, you will see certain similarities if you recall the Pitt/Jolie movie.John and Jane admit to each other that they joined the Company because no one else would take them. They commit to a relationship with no romance, but when you get to Episode 2, you will see that falls apart.In the beginning I enjoyed the banter between John and Jane. It was like boy meets girl and boy likes girl and it was fun seeing how they interacted with each other. They worked well going on spy type missions that the company mandated.Yes, this is slow going and rightly so, but when you get to Episodes 6, 7 and 8 all changes. Ep 6 has them going to couples counselling; EP 7 has Jane finding out that John has been seeing someone else; and EP 8 bring everything to a head and it is here in EP 8 that you will vividly recall the Pitt/Jolie movie. Trust me.Notables: Ron Pearlman as Toby Hellinger who they kidnap; Paul Dano as their neighbor; Wagner Moura as another John Smith; Parker Posey as another Jane Smith; And you will see Beverly Glover as Donald's real mother. (Donald Glover produced this movie)Two things I had trouble with: 1. The sound quality was not good often as the characters often talked in low tones, and 2. We often see John or Jane looking at their phones for text messages and we see the screens, but we cannot make out the words. Not good. Bad direction here.Yes, this is slow going and it had to be to capture the flavor of two people who needed to learn to trust each other in a very dangerous job.Violence: Yes.Sex: No.Nudity: There is a painting in their house of a naked man and woman.Humor; Sometimes

"I figured the 1st episode was just slow-burn material, introducing the characters & the premise, then it'd pick up a little more with each continuing episode. The tone & pacing remained the same, which made it a bit of a chore to watch. While the main characters do have mildly entertaining chemistry with one another and there are some interesting & moderately humorous scenarios, the episodes overall just aren't that engaging or interesting.I think I'd rather see them doing missions as experienced professionals than as somewhat bumbling amateurs trying to make things up as they go along. Even the action sequences are a bit lackluster... Not terrible, but just kind of by-the-numbers.Just not for me.",IMDB,Watched the 1st 3 episodes... Lost interest.,5.0
"I could not stop watching this show! It kept me guessing and I had to watch the next episode to find out what happens next.I LOVE spy shows with how-are-we-gonna-get-out-of-this-mess situations, and characters having to use their wits.THIS version of Mr. & Mrs. Smith is NOT your chic sexy Angelina & Brad,
BUT this version is UNIQUE and fun and Maya Erskine as JANE SMITH is fantastic & hilarious.The couple's imperfectionists and clunkiness make them relatable and very likeable. The ""comedy"" aspects of the series does not make the spy missions LESS thrilling or suspenseful. The writing is sharp and witty and the comics have great timing (Maya!)Please do a SEASON TWO because I just devoured Season ONE!",IMDB,I binge-watched all 8 episodes in one sitting!,10.0
"I watched all 8 episodes and found them to have the same sentiment as the original movie but with a ton more depth. And also what I thought was better acting, Donald and Maya took every episode and put their full acting strength behind it to give each episode a familiar piece of life with some crazy action involved too. Some of the mid episodes definitely just felt like fillers and since we had the general plot going we didn't feel as we had to watch every second to get the gist. Now to the ending, DIDN'T LIKE, why with 8 full episodes would the series runners leave it on a cliffhanger... not appreciated and made me have mixed feelings toward the entire series. Boo.",IMDB,Same story but more...,7.0
"I see a lot of discussion surrounding how alike or different this is from the movie. Even though I love the movie, I went into this without any expectations on what it should or shouldn't be. But even with an open mind, I just found myself not fully enjoying this series. I reluctantly continued through to the end.It has plenty of good. Both leads give great performances. I enjoyed the dialogue, especially the heated debates. There are a few powerful moments. And the action is serviceable (but scarce).It's hard to understand why I couldn't get into it more. But I think one problem is that, episode to episode, there are major shifts in their relationship and the story in general. We don't see how or why it happens. It's all offscreen and it's fairly jarring. On two different occasions, I double checked which episode I started to make sure I didn't skip one.For that and other unknown reasons, I always felt at an arm's length from this story.

"Mr. & Mrs. Smith Season 1 delivers a thrilling and clever experience that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Each episode is skillfully crafted weaving a narrative that continually keeps audiences guessing. Drawing inspiration from the original movie, the series maintains its essence while offering a fresh and exciting take on the 'existing' characters.From the first episode to the last, the brilliance of the writing shines bright. As the season progresses, the stakes continue to rise, keeping audiences hooked until the very end.Mr and Mrs Smith has quickly become a standout in the crowded landscape of television. I, for one, cannot wait to see what season two has in store.",IMDB,Better than I expected,10.0
"Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2024) has an almost dreamlike, enchanting quality that keeps you mesmerized throughout its eight episodes of the first season. There is no flashiness or exuberance as seen in Doug Liman's movie. This remake is extremely understated, with the focus on relationship drama rather than providing outright action thrills. While action does come into play, it is not the primary focus of this adaptation. This approach works well for the show, as it is not a mere copy-paste of the movie; it offers something different, something deeper, and more unique than the original, which was great in its own right. Donald Glover and Maya Erskine are stupendous, their chemistry and quirkiness making the show truly stand out.",IMDB,"Love the movie, love this show as well.",7.0
"You wouldn't expect an action series continuing a well-established franchise of the same genre to actually be a two-character play, but that's exactly what it is.Don't get me wrong, the fight scenes are not lacking, and they're exceptionally well-done, but the overall impression is not of your typical action-packed series.The writers are absolutely brilliant, and the dialogue between the two main characters, the two spies named ""Smith,"" a sort of generic conspiratorial name, feels like a conversation between two regular people in a relationship. Their ""service"" as mega-spies seems almost incidental. They argue, they love each other, literally and figuratively, they have normal people problems with their own families, the whole package.Two exceptional actors, Donald Glover and Maya Erskine, are the best proof that diversity hiring, when it doesn't overshadow talent and competence, doesn't bother anyone.It's leagues above the original 2005 film with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, which is a two-dimensional comedy with shootouts and gimmicks.The series is available on Prime Video via subscription.",IMDB,Mr. and Mrs. Smith or The Afternoon of an Elite Spy,10.0
"I enjoyed this series, despite the pace being a little slow. The first episode was a good hook that packed mystery and a punch. I liked the two main characters and a lot of the other celebs that came in.The layers of the story worked but I felt there could have been more to tell. What I watched was just scratching the surface.The transition from strangers, to lovers to irritation didn't quite hit the mark for me, it felt a little rushed. But I enjoyed the interactions and the eventual friction.The end was slightly fantasy with StormTrooper precision shooting. Not to mention a cliche ending that felt a little desperate for another series. The fade to black was a mixture of satisfaction and disappointment. The potential was there but the story got a little lazy as the end approached. I was expecting more intelligence from the script.But I did enjoy it. And I do recommend it.",IMDB,A little slow but I kept watching...,7.0
"Wow, the first episode was awesome, I thought, this is going to be great! Silly me, the subsequent episodes were just farcical, plain silly, or just plain boring. Episode 5 should have been good, but so much time was wasted on their rapid and unreal, relationship. Their unbelievable relationship does not ring true at all. The casting itself has its problems. I'm actually typing this as it's playing on Prime, because I just don't care what is happening on the screen. All in all, an opportunity lost. This could have been so much better. I seriously doubt it will see a second season. I'm not sure I'll bother with any more, it just does not move along fast enough, and is way too flippant.",IMDB,Groan!,3.0
"Considering it's written by most of the team from Atlanta, I should have expected this, but I didn't. This was a pure delight. A special type of show! One of the realist, most affecting depictions of a relationship I have ever seen. The chemistry between Glover and Erskine is 1000% genuine and earned. They really felt like a couple, but also fought (oh yes) like a couple. Some of the arguemental fights in this were so raw and emotionally charged I was in awe.What a fantastic show that manages to be something new and still finds the time to reference a dated movie that people really don't remember that well. Seriously, a Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 2024 sounds like a waste of time but I couldn't be more wrong. Inject this show into my soul!",IMDB,So much better than it has any right to be,10.0
"I'm going to preface this by saying.. it is not for me. Also, it was hard to get through, and I might have jumped a few episodes in my conquest to see how it ended!Did not enjoy the casting at all (not one role from the episodes I watched), nor the general chemistry, nor the way characters are written, nor the slow developments or generic ""serial"" execution. I admit, by giving this tittle its name, they got me! Otherwise, I would not have bothered. Sadly, I was correct in my assumptions regarding my taste.Remaking this ""franchise"" is nothing new..
I admit, I have not watched the 1941 version, nor the 1996 TV series attempt. And while I think the 2007 pilot (with the charming Jordana Brewster) was more in line with what was presented in Brad Pitt's 2005 release (and therefore more enjoyable, even in its simplicity).. it is safe to say that it is enough already!! Still, I wouid rather re-watch the over-the-top and energetic 2005 movie with likeable Actors a thousand times over.. than to finish this properly.Mr and Mrs Smith means something to me already, and changing the vibe completely results in a product that doesn't remotely satisfy me. I might not have high standards, but some things cannot be improved upon.. specially when there's a lack of charisma.",IMDB,It just doesn't work,3.0
"This show starts slow, hence the impatience of the ADD generation and bad reviews. Two people are put together to be spies for a mysterious organization. Both of their personalities are very different, so it takes time for them to gel and for the audience to get to know them. That's actually a strength as the series continues because just like a real relationship their differences is what makes it work. Their relationship starts slow, develops, then their personalities clash after the honeymoon phase and the show does a good job of exploring where the characters go from here. Unlike the movie it does a better job of exploring the relationship dynamic and is not as dependent on their looks. The movie was terrible, and there in lies a problem. People who liked the attractive people in the movie, explosions, and action aren't going to enjoy a nuanced show about how to make relationships work within a spy show. This is more of a show about being in a relationship with two very different personalities than a spy show. If you're looking for a flashy show, with attractive people, no plot, lots of explosions, then watch the movie. If you want actual characters, character development, and an overarching storyline, then give this series a try. It's a slow burn that requires a little patience. It's by no means perfect, but you might find yourself growing to like their characters as the series progresses. The show does take some liberties to push the storyline along and to further explore their relationship. Examples include the episode with Toby who acts more like their child than a grown man, their opening up their home and secrets to another couple, and others. This is done to further show the relationship dynamic more than the actual spy craft. It is a fun show, just more relationship oriented and character development than action.",IMDB,Relationships in Spy Craft,8.0
"""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" starts with promise, hooking viewers early on, especially when John meets his intriguing counterpart. However, the series quickly nosedives, suffering from inconsistent writing and directing. Both action and comedy, crucial to its appeal, miss the mark significantly. It's puzzling how it attracted big names with such a weak script. The characters, particularly John Smith, feel underdeveloped, with potential deep dives into their psyche skimmed over superficially. Despite a few decent episodes, the show's inability to sustain its initial intrigue makes it hard to recommend. A mixed effort that could have been much more.",IMDB,Chat GPT wrote half of this script. It is lazy writing and direction.,7.0
"I felt driven to provide a review after seeing the dumpster fire growing here. People seem to be expecting to see the Donald Glover they remember from Community, or some endless, action-packed rollercoaster that simply repeats the movie formula for a dozen hours.Let this series be what it is, a spy dramedy, halfway between drama and comedy, just like a relationship, which is key to this show.The opening sequence seems like a nod to the original, telling us that the Pitt/Jolie Smiths were taken out by other Smiths, after running for some unstated period of time.Then we can learn about a new Mr and Mrs Smith, from recruitment to retirement, and watch their relationship grow, through the lens of international espionage. It's a fun concept that is well executed, if you can just let go of the fact that it isn't the same as the movie.",IMDB,"This isn't the movie, get over it.",8.0
"The chemistry between the leads is what propels this series. They're both hilarious people, and the series really leans into that. The pacing is slow, but I appreciated how it segues into the main conflict in the later episodes. Amazing cameos from Sarah Paulson, Parker Posey, John Turturro, and more.I think what lacks is the coherence of the plot in the first half of the series. It almost feels like a deadly Broad City, two inept people stumbling around and messing up as much as possible. Glover has a flirty nature that works, and it's some of his best dramatic work I've seen. It's Maya Erskine that shines though. She's hilarious, deadpan when needed, and she has vulnerability that makes the series as a whole unique for a spy thriller.In tone, it's more romantic dramedy than anything. It has obvious nods to the Pitt-Jolie film (the fight between John and Jane in the finale was amazing!), but it has its own unique plane. The therapy episode is well written and Sarah Paulson is a highlight. I would love to see a second season.",IMDB,Surprising!,7.0
"There's not much to say about this show but I need to use six hundred characters so here we go. The acting is good and the cast is great but the storyline and characters are awful. Maya Erskine's acting is great but as a character I hate Jane, she's an awful person and John deserves better even though you have to be a psycho to do the job in the first place. There's nobody I care about and for an action show it's quite boring. I have no interest in season two and based other reviews I'm not alone. Lastly I'm one hundred percent convinced Paul Dano only accepted this role because his name is ""Hot Neighbor"" a title I'm sure he cherished.",IMDB,Pure mediocrity,6.0
"I hate to say it because I really love the two main actors, but this is not a great show. The constant bickering between them in each episode gave me anxiety, and by the time each episode finished, I was mad at my husband for absolutely no reason. I felt like a child stuck in a car with two bickering parents for hours on end. Both actors are great and it really has the possibility of being decent if they cut out a large portion of the endless unnecessary dialogue and fighting between the two main characters and keep building the action portions of the show. I get that it's supposed to be a relationship show as well as action but their relationship is too painful to watch.",IMDB,Painful.,5.0
"This series has nothing but the premise in common with 2005s mr and mrs smith. First of all the main lead while charming in his own right is no brad pitt, similarly the female lead no angelina jolie. The premise of the first movie was shallow, it was just 2 overly attractive film stars who were never seen together in a movie fawning over each other and displaying their sexiness, with some bad plot in the background. This movie actually explores the plot, two pretend married agents going on missions and step by step getting intimate. It is a blurry line they are traversing between the professional strictly lethal business and the attraction. It is complex,a very messy unconventional hands on movie i would very much like to compare to beef. You never know where the plot is going or how the relationship will develop. Its messiness does contribute to it losing focus, it is set up as a spy thriller but the dialogue is very much atlanta like, way more casual intertwined than any spy movie ive ever watched. This is however to its detriment sometimes because whilst the story, the progression are enjoyable due to the complexity it creates, you have a hard time buying either of the characters as stone cold killers they are supposed to be.Still the dialogue is simply superb, the chemistry is there, the story is a thrill. You just need to remove the bradjelina glasses and enjoy the ride.",IMDB,people are misunderstanding this series,8.0
"So far, I am only 2 episodes in and I must say I am intrigued. So far it is episodic, so I felt more at ease to take a break but it left me with a positive feeling.I would say that I generally liked the movie with the same name, but it always just left me with the feeling that they can't possibly not have known.This take starts off with them being paired together with the company and their cover is that they are a married couple. So far I like that they show the awkwardness such a situation would leave the characters in. The characters seem very believable to me.Sometimes the mission plots don't seem as believable to me. The mission info exchanges doesn't look like it gives them a clear enough objective and that it is purposefully vague just to get more out of the story.Edit: Finished the show - I think my negative listed here might have something todo with the bigger plot of the follow up season if there is ever going to be one. Upped my rating to 7 from 6.",IMDB,Good solid show,7.0
"I never saw the movies so I went into this blind which would have been a good thing if this series stood on its own. However, all the criticism I have read are extremely accurate. It's not that there wasn't a premise here that had possibilities. It's just the way it was produced and the lack of continuity in the storyline.It's hard to find fault with a fiction piece on the grounds that it's unbelievable because fiction is all about coloring outside the lines. However, there has to be something the viewer can connect with. A thread that ties the storyline together and it can't take forever to get there. This series was about the irony of the relationships of Smith's and although that was interesting and entertaining, too much of the series was devoted to that. Then leaving the series on a cliffhanger, not tidying up loose ends, tends to leave a portion of viewers dissatisfied.Would I watch a second season? It wasn't so terrible that a second chance wouldn't be worth trying. But I definitely would not sit through another soap opera of 'spy couples finding themselves' again.",IMDB,Killing Eve This Was Not!,5.0
"After seeing the low ratings for this show, I couldn't help but think, ""Oh no, not another disappointment."" However, since I'm a fan of espionage-themed TV shows and movies, and having enjoyed the film, I felt compelled to give this TV series a chance. And, I'm glad I did. While the movie leaned heavily on the sex appeal of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, this rendition of Mr. & Mrs. Smith excels in both acting and writing. With only 8 episodes, building a story arc with substantial depth is no easy feat. Yet, this series manages it admirably. Each episode is fun to watch, and it's evident that the cast relished portraying these deadly characters. Although it was seemingly written as a limited series, I'm really hoping for a second season.",IMDB,Fresh reimagining of a decent movie,8.0
"Like so many other shows, the writers poured a lot of thought and effort into the first episodes; but, again like so many other shows, they decided to abandon their recipe for success so they could introduce a lot of faux drama.What made the first five episodes so good was the fact that the writers focused on Mr. And Mrs. Smith performing their missions. There was humor, excitement, romance, and intrigue. What made the last three episodes so bad was the fac that the writers abandoned all that so they could pursue some childish notion of drama and action.Overall, I enjoyed it and will watch season two (if there is one); I just hope the writers give up on there pursuit of juvenile pseudo drama and return to the formula that made the series worth watching.",IMDB,Couldn't sustain its great start,6.0
"It starts with so much promise and excitement like a firework when you light the fuse but this one's a dud and it slowly.......very slowly fizzles out with a whimpering pop right at the very end before flopping to the ground. Most of this show will see you playing on your phone not caring about what's on the screen even though it's beautifully and very artfully shot before finally you reach the agonisingly slow ending that leaves you wondering why you even bothered. The idea showed so much promise but its as though they got lost along the way and just ran with it, the acting is average at best and the story is dull.",IMDB,Like a cheap firework,6.0
"When you see the title of this show, you roll your eyes and groan at yet another remake/reboot of an old property, until you watch to see that it's just in the title. That it's refreshingly and surprisingly different. That, aside from the title, it has nothing to do with the original movie.The show is a blended mix of the concept The Americans as far as the sleeper agent married couple matched together to go on secret missions that wind up falling in love with each other, with heavy doses of the absurdist and surrealist action, humor, and takes of Atlanta and Killing Eve. Especially with the Atlanta and Killing Eve elements, since Hiro Murai directs a few episodes, while Phoebe Waller Bridge was originally meant to play Jane before she dropped out of the project. Glover's John is a facsimile of Earn from Atlanta while Erskine's Jane has shades of Eve from Killing Eve.The show overall is very talky, but it weirdly works, particularly with so much conversation taking place during the first mission. And, unlike the original, there's much more of a slow burn in terms of understanding who these strangers are and how much of what they say is true. It would have been a hopeless task to replicate the scorching sexual tension between Pitt and Jolie (enough to break up Pitt and Anniston and send Pitt towards Angelina), so this show was right to not even try, but they do a good job of building up a budding romance between the two until it starts to fall apart as quickly as it grew and that's where the show's flaws start to happen.The biggest flaw is that there are major shifts and whiplash in their relationship and the story in general as the show doesn't go into the detail as to the why it happens. It mostly happens all off-screen and it's fairly jarring. And unlike the original movie, these two are just not on the same page. Glover's John seems to be dumb, impulsive, and easily distracted, while Erskine seems like a corporate white collar careerist climbing the ladder more than a deadly spy. Neither seem to remember or care about the super dangerous situations they're in.The action scenes are more perfunctory, which is also jarring since this is supposed to be an action/spy show. The baddies that show up have Storm Trooper aim and don't seem to serve any kind of purpose other than to have our couple shoot at things, as you never really feel that they are in any serious danger with a total lack of suspense and edge. There are lots of cameo appearances from great actors and actresses such as John Turturo, Ron Perlman, Sharon Horgan, Parker Posey, Alexander Skarsgard, Paul Dano, but they're wasted. Especially Dano, Turturo, Horgan, Posey, and Skarsgard. Only Perlman's episode and character works. The show's cinematography, style, and locations are nice though.Despite it's mixed bag and heavy flaws, it's an enjoyable romp that deserves more seasons. I think the episodes should be longer in length in order to better flesh out the relationship, give these celebrity cameos more to do than to just give this show more star power, and add more action and make the action scenes more taught, gripping, and suspenseful to show how that impacts the relationship like it did in The Americans. They can also dispense with the chatbot handler and do some world building as far as explaining who this mysterious agency is and why they would want these two to do their dirty work. There is potential for this to be a great series with some better editing and work!",IMDB,More like a sassy millenial rom-com with spy elements than a remake/reboot of Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.0

The worst part might be that the two leads are actually excellent actors, but you wouldn't know it if you judged them solely on this show, because they are forced to play possibly the two dullest human beings who have ever existed. The entire first episode, with a small exception for one moment of inane drama, is like watching paint dry, but without the excitement. It's almost as if the two are having a boring contest: who can be the dullest person. They both win. And they continue to win throughout this extremely poorly written, poorly plotted show.

"Glover and Erskine have wonderful chemistry! Their romance is portrayed from a female perspective, focusing more on the couple's sense of humor and flawed personalities, and less on their sexuality--which came as a surprise because it is based on that Brangelina movie.The passage of time in between episodes is quite confusing since the actors' appearances don't change much, which made some developments on their relationship appear too sudden.The show also has a tendency to be a bit too on the nose with its themes, often portraying an issue within their current mission that occurs in parallel with the state of their relationship. The Italy episode, for instance, made the couple confront their differing views on parenting by having an adult character needlessly act as a cringey man-child, which I found annoying and unrealistic.Another issue I had when it comes to suspending my disbelief is the fact that the couple never seems to get in trouble with law enforcement, especially on their messy early missions. I want to know how no one came looking for them when a billionaire turned up missing after drawing attention to himself under the influence of truth serum.Despite these concerns, I still find the show entertaining and worthy of a score of 7/10.",IMDB,Slow start but picks up fast after the pilot,1.0
Please understand I am not comparing this show to the movie. For me it is a stand alone series. The problem is the two main characters have zero and I mean zero chemistry. I like many shows in which the characters have a connection but no one in this show has any of that. Therefore the plot does not work because they can't carry it off. The episodes have constant talking without any substance. I can enjoy dark theme if there is something behind it. The action is somewhat believable at times and then it is so contrived and not convincing. It is my recommendation to let thos go and hopefully a sequel will not be in the works.,IMDB,Boring,8.0

It feels like a hidden camera in an actual household.The problem with that is the problems, situations, and conversations they have are just the very same ones people actually have. This makes the show boring, predictable (because it's just normal problems everyone knows), not engaging.The therapy sessions were a chore to go through. They did not ENTERTAIN, the point they were trying to make, could have been done in few minutes, not an entire episode of recited word salad.And on top of it all - the characters were unlikable. 0 chemistry.

This is as far as possible from that (in a good way) with a plot that takes you, yes from action and some shooting through some chapters, but ultimately not the main part of it. You have action, but in between there's a lot of drama, talking, actions and events that influence the main characters making them more realistic and having a sense that this is something that could actually happen or at least be real, unlike the movie where everything feels to Hollywoodeske and unbelievable.",IMDB,"Super enjoyable, fun to watch with that comedic tone of Donald Glover.",7.0

They've taken a forced proximity trope, added some fun spy world building & action but seen the relationship to fruition, not just the honeymoon phase. Yes, it's medium paced at times but some of the moments that this show creates are worth it. I felt like I could wholly relate to some of their insecurities & reasons for disagreement.It's such a well written, witty piece of work with a strong portrayal of two nuanced characters in a relationship.

It's way different from the movie, but in a cool way. The chemistry between the lead is good & believable, they have the ""opposites attract"" thing going on & it worked well. The action scenes & humor are both understated & exaggerated at the same time, it's a weird phenomenon that they managed to pull off. Plus, the show's production is top-notch - all the different set locations are nice to look at & the music/score suits the whole vibe of the show pretty well. It's a solid watch that's worth checking out.",IMDB,Pleasantly surprised,8.0
"This is the remake version of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which expands the love story from the movie into a narrative of the fake couple's ordinary-looking secret agent life. They face the typical challenges and romantic dilemmas from the beginning to the conclusive end, just like real couples. The series is well-executed, with action scenes sprinkled in each episode as a mere seasoning. The action-packed sequences are particularly prominent in episodes 5 and 8, while the rest of the series maintains a lighter tone. It's worth noting that this series is more about the complete portrayal of a fictional couple's life rather than delivering intense action scenes. If you're expecting thrilling action, you might be disappointed, but if you're interested in a light-hearted portrayal of a spy couple's misadventures in love and missions, then this series will not disappoint.",IMDB,A remake with minimal action but rich in intricate romantic drama!,7.0
"Supremely boring, so guy and girl meet for a job interview with a random computer screen. Guy and girl pass interview and are given missions. Guy and girl work on accomplishing missions. This gets a supreme negative rating for the plot, lack of realism, and generally nothing even remotely approaching tradecraft.They do the thing that most regular people would do if they were put in this situation and kind of wing it every single time. And sometimes it works, and other time it doesn't. So the issue with that is that no one with any kind of training would ever approach these jobs that way. Even amateurs would have more of a plan. And even when they are working together it's so obvious they aren't on the same page it's just bad.5/10 great acting, absolutely ridiculous script, lacks any sense of realism.",IMDB,*Yawn*,5.0

Someone should have told the makers of this bore that those are important elements, but it's apparent that no one did. The funding is obviously there considering the sets and locations, but it's apparent here that money isn't everything. I'm not a quitter, but had to shut the door on this one after about two episodes as I don't see this getting better, but prolonged agony, instead.

"This reimagining of the 2005 classic, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"" is a brilliant blend of intelligence, authenticity, and humor that surpasses the original in many aspects. Donald Glover and Maya Erskine bring Mr. & Mrs. Smith to life as three-dimensional characters, each with a believability and intrigue that overshadows the portrayal by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, turning them into mere gun-wielding Ken and Barbie figures.Comprising eight riveting episodes, the series feels like a tantalizing glimpse into a much larger and intricately woven narrative. From the captivating opening scene of the first episode to the suspenseful cliff-hanger of the last, it leaves viewers yearning for more, showcasing a masterclass in storytelling excellence.The scripts are impeccable, delivering unexpected plot twists that keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The acting is of the highest caliber, with raw and genuine performances that breathe life into the characters. The action sequences are visceral and authentic, while the well-crafted jokes land with perfect timing.Available on Amazon Prime in Malaysia, this series is a must-watch for those seeking an elevated entertainment experience, combining stellar performances, gripping plotlines, and an overall mastery of the art of storytelling.",IMDB,"Hi hi, this is GOOD!",9.0
"As an adaptation, Mr and Mrs Smith 2024 is a fascinating show that explores the lives of married spies beyond the concept of the original film.It shows how a secret organization pairs up these couples, how they cope with a forced marriage, how they face life-threatening situations together, how they communicate or fail to communicate with each other, and how they balance their work and personal lives.The series features two charismatic leads and a stellar supporting cast, and blends elements of romance, comedy, mystery, action, and espionage.It is a fun and engaging show that I binge-watched in one night. The tone of the series is more subtle and nuanced than the original movie, but I think it is a smart and enjoyable adaptation.",IMDB,Very Binge Worthy.,7.0
"Ill just say this because a lot of negative reviews are focused on comparing this to the film: this is NOT the movie. It is NOT a fun quick spy action thriller (although it has its moments) that repeats and makes fun of those tropes. It is a smart interesting realistic take on the original movies premise. It is a high concept relationship drama set in that world. The show focuses on their dynamic. Donald and Maya do an excellent job of portraying 2 incompatible people pretending to be married and work together. They are not beautiful charismatic super spies like Brad and Angelina were. They are 2 normal people with spy skills doing a weird job. The humor and fun comes from watching all the normal couple quirks/fights that we all have experienced run into all of crazy spy stuff they have to do as well. The cinematography is beautiful and the writing feels grounded and realistic. If that sounds interesting to you, you will love this show. If it doesn't, you should probably skip this. I liked the movie and I had a great time binging this too. They are both excellent in different ways and that is ok.",IMDB,A fun smart high concept relationship drama set in spy thriller world,10.0
"I don't understand why people are so upset that this isn't like the movie. Why would it be? Different writers, actors etc. If you know Donald Glover's work then you know this is along the lines of how he would do it. Quirky, sarcastic, funny mixed in with the action.It had dark humor, great fighting scenes and although there were some slow part and a bit too much talking in certain places- overall it was entertaining and easy to watch.People are saying there is no plot, the plot has always been the two people being Mr and Mrs Smith working on jobs together until it goes sideways.....this is exactly what happened.",IMDB,Fun to watch- it's not the movie- get over it.,7.0

"The characters where underdeveloped, the pacing was fine but felt odd at times, most of the important parts of the story felt as if they were being told through memories and flashbacks. The spy plot and the entire agency and ""Hihi"" plot felt really promising but ultimately, it felt as if it wasn't done properly but I'm sure this will be resolved in season 2. The pace at which they fell for each other felt a bit fast, jarring and underserved. The fact that the story relied on easily solved and fickle problems was kind of a cheap move on their part. The way the problems were diffused also felt unnatural in a way.The story could have been a lot better in so many ways but it felt as if the writing didn't meet the expectations of the premise of the story.",IMDB,A good premise which ultimately fell victim to its own writing and pacing,6.0

"The series was about two spies who had to marry for their jobs by order of their company. But soon their marriage becomes fragile and full of disbelief, anger, and jealousy. The ending was sort of unexpected, and the film was full of fragments and unanswered questions.However, a more detailed background story about the characters could've been added, and some scenes, for example, the first scene, made no sense to me. The only connection that exists is what happens to those who fail to complete their mission. But I think that was unimportant and redundant.But in the end, it wasn't such a waste of time. The time I spent watching the film wasn't boring; instead, it was quite enjoyable.",IMDB,hihi,7.0

Constantly running their mouth, and nothing interesting comes out.It's just plain boring.Why even name it after a movie if you're not adapting anything from the original movie?There's literally nothing from the original movie except Brad and Angelina getting killed in the first 50 seconds.

Really reminded me their 'ATLANTA' days really with how their character interact with casual dialogues.It can upset a lot of people who are a fan of the predecessor but this series is much more original and better than the movie because of the style and chemistry are much more engaging.Love it so far and Donald Glover's Team never disappoints.",IMDB,Refreshing takes on romance spy-thriller,9.0

When the action kicks in, its enjoyable but there's little of that to be had in the first two episodes.

Just out of curiosity, I wanted to see if I would stick around as Daniel Glover was in it (Community).The two actors are fantastic. They have an amazing, amazing chemistry. So much, so that I often thought ""Guys, what are you doing?"".The last episode was so heartbreaking, it's unbelievable.The show is fun and complex at the same time. They address real issues throughout it. The humor is top-level and far from silly. The romance is class A. The action is on top, but not that important.I want to give a big bravo to Amazon. Usually, I would thank Netflix, but this show is on another level.With the Boys and this show, it's going to be hard considering canceling Prime.What a slap.Just bravo for these formidable moments.

"I was really looking forward to the show and thought I would really love it because I really liked the movie but I was extremely disappointed by the show. It was really whiny and focused too much on their marriage I felt I needed therapy or marriage counseling after watching it and I'm not even married. The show could've been so much better though if they relied more on their missions and less on the romantic aspect of it. Also, getting tired of watching the same boring interracial relationship that are in every movie and show now like the rest of the world doesn't exist. It's usually a black dude and a white woman or occasionally they'll switch it up and have the opposite, for this show they had a black dude and an Asian woman which I guess is an improvement? Still missing a huge part of the world and it's not like there's not actors available from around the world that can be cast.

It's unbelievable how both of them can survive attacks without being injured in any way.

Yet, they are in this Prime show revolved around action and drama. There are only but several scenes of comedy. In those few scenes are where the actors shine the most. If you like Maya Erskine and miss PEN15, there are two scenes that reminded me of the show. In one scene, Maya makes a silly face in the mirror and the other scene is where her and Donald are in bed and she farts in bed and she feels embarrassed and tells him to stop making fun of her.

If you are or were a married man, you'll really enjoy this series, and it will conjure up warm memories for you.Maya Erskine really steals the show with her ruthlessness, vulnerability, and humor.

"I changed my rating 3 times, because it is so hard to feel a specific thing (good or bad) about Mr and Mrs Smith. But in the end, I'm here, with a 7/10!I am looking forward to see John and Jane again in the next season. I realised that I can only remember their connection despite all the imperfect of the story. How John still cooks the soup for Jane eventhough he failed on mission. How Jane looks straight to John's eyes and said ""Mine is your"". All of that moments make the show, in my opinion.There is one thing we could agree on together is Donald Glover and Maya Erksine are really great cast, they played their roles well but their chemistry fluttered me more. The sweet and bitter of a relationship is revealed through 8 episodes and I will not binge through it if there are not them. Ep 5 and 6 really shine.However, I do feel that the show somehow lacks of purpose at some point, I'm confused about the Hihi system.

I seriously didn't expect this show to be what it is, I see why they have a number of Emmy nominations for this show.

"In the vast expanse of television offerings, where the spy genre often treads a well-worn path, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" emerges as a series that attempts to redefine the narrative with a blend of romance and espionage. The show, a reimagining of the 2005 film, introduces us to a new John and Jane, portrayed by Donald Glover and Maya Erskine, whose chemistry is the linchpin of this Prime Video series.The series opens with a promise of intrigue and the allure of the unknown. John and Jane, strangers at first, are recruited by a mysterious organization that pays handsomely for their services as undercover agents posing as a married couple. The premise is ripe with potential, and the show capitalizes on this with a narrative that unfolds with the precision of a Swiss watch.Glover and Erskine bring a refreshing dynamic to the screen. Their transition from strangers to lovers is handled with a finesse that is both believable and captivating. The series shines in moments where their relationship evolves amidst the chaos of their profession. It's in these moments that the show feels like it's more than just a spy caper; it's a study of intimacy and the complexities of human connection.The creators have infused each episode with elements that echo the grandeur of ""Mission: Impossible,"" albeit on a smaller scale. The action sequences, while not groundbreaking, are executed with enough flair to keep the adrenaline pumping. The show's humor is another highlight, with a particular fart scene that is as unexpected as it is delightful, showcasing the show's ability to balance levity with its more serious undertones.The overarching plot sometimes feels like an afterthought, a mere backdrop for the characters' romantic entanglements. The villains and the stakes they present are often underdeveloped, leaving the viewer wanting more depth and complexity from the antagonistic forces.The pacing of the series is inconsistent. Some episodes race through their plot points, while others meander, indulging in character development at the expense of narrative momentum. This uneven tempo can be jarring and sometimes detracts from the overall cohesion of the story.The production values, while generally high, occasionally betray the show's television budget. The reliance on CGI over practical effects is evident in places, and while this doesn't ruin the experience, it does remind the viewer of the show's limitations within its medium.""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is a series that offers a unique take on the spy genre, with standout performances and a charming central romance. It's a commendable effort that, despite its flaws, provides an entertaining and occasionally thought-provoking viewing experience. The show may not redefine television, but it certainly adds a distinctive flavor to the spy narrative, one that is worth sampling for those yearning for a blend of action, romance, and humor.",IMDB,Espionage and Romance Collide: 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' Delivers Action with a Heart,3.0

It's the silences where they are measuring each other up, trying to figure out if whats happening between them is real or just spy shenanigans.The missions around their married existence vary from simple to outright dangerous and the show manages to balance the character nicely within the action so that their development never slows.The vibe is very Glover who has his hands all over the project. The scripts are lean, the missions fun and the overall vibe of the show is pretty slick.

So I never made a comparison with the old movie, unlike many reviewers on here. I enjoyed the first few episodes, I thought they were not too cliched, but then it did get a bit boring and repetitive. They could not keep up the level of uniqueness. The characters are alright, and not so shallow like the rest. Although, they did get weird sometimes.

It felt more like a funky love story about two people in an arranged marriage that didn't have a chance. The original movie gave us sexy, action, thrills not this. This should have been called something else and have no relation to the movie.

"Its an okay show. I see a lot of people complaining about the pacing, but that's their own preconceptions getting in the way of their experience.There is some spy/assassination stuff, but a lot of the show concentrates on their relationship. Which is not a terrible thing in and of itself. Its just not like the movie really.I think maybe the creators got the wrong idea of why people liked the movie, for the relationship stuff. But no, the movie was mostly for the action. This show is not. Its mostly about the people.I think Donald Glover should win some sort of acting award for his attraction to maya erskine. I'm really not sure what the appeal is for her. I find her acting flat, and not much star appeal at all. I'm guessing she's another one of those nepo-babies that keep popping up.

I actually don't like the movie with Brad and Angelina. So I hesitated to watch this show. I'm so glad I chose to. I was very entertained.

"It is always an issue when one mimics a similar movie that many know well, but each version has a right to chart their own course. In some ways, the 8 episodes are a bit uneven, but got stronger as the series progressed. Part of that is one got to know the characters better. And there is some really good humor,like when Jane tells John about the 78 marbles in the jar. One never knows exactly who they are working for and why the targets were selected. But the payments were high after each one. In Episode 2, I felt the composter ending was out of place. In Episode 5, John got quite annoying, but that was followed by the humor in Episode 6 when they sought therapy, but naturally had to stick to their cover story about their jobs, and not the real reason for their troubles. In Episode 7, there was a lot of bickering, and it seems HiHi was playing games. And Episode 8 really raised the stakes and the tension and they certainly went through a rough patch. It really begs the need for another season. Overall, it was enjoyable to watch.",IMDB,Enjoyable to watch,6.0
"This is a great show. It's unique, well-acted and well-written. Those hating on it are deluded that the film it steals its premise from was any good to begin with. This show better explores family, love, relationships, and hell, action than the film ever did. Mostly, it's smart. It doesn't speak down to the viewer and respects us to pay attention and catch things from episode to episode. The cast of exceptional bit players is also wonderful to see.My only real ""complaint"" about the show is that I'd prefer one case over a season rather than one case per episode. If they do a second season - and I think that they should - I hope the writers take this into consideration.Glover and Erskine are terrific. Fantastic pairing!",IMDB,Terrific show - so much better than the movie,1.0
"This is a series with excellent production quality and good acting. It has everything on paper, the chemistry between the two leads, lots of other talented actors in each episode, nice picturesque venues, enough action, as well as really funny moments... it should work, but, somehow it doesn't really. I think the problem is with the plot. And I don't mean the holes in it, this genre has high tolerance for these kind of nonsense. I think, the problem is that this series doesn't explore the roads it can take with this idea. Each episode something intriguing starts to happen but soon we're right at the beginning where we started. A bomb goes off, unexpectedly, that doesn't change anything for our duo, they don't feel the need to hide for a while for example. A man dies in their apartment, they are not exposed although they have a nosey neighbour, which is Paul Dano by the way, criminally underused. Why call Paul Dano and give him nothing but a dog as content ? Anyway, they botch a job in my opinion by interfering with it while it was not on the mission description but apparently there are no consequences. The options are not narrowing, they never leave their comfort zone, the real threat of annihilation as a result of failure or mutiny we witnessed with the other couple at the beginning seems to lose its power with these two. Why? It could be much funnier to see them cracking jokes when in real trouble, running out of options. The other living John-Jane couple they met at the market looks like their story is much more interesting and three dimensional than our heroes. These two need their story arc. (Think Alias, which nailed the difficult mix of sexy spy action / soap comedy formula decades ago ) Are they duped into something sinister ? Are they going to wake up to see that there's no leaving the firm or will they continue merrily as it is? Are they going to fail and run? Will other people surrounding them - played by John Turturro or Wagner Moura for crying out loud! - turn out to have meaningful reasons for being there or the actors are just showing up for easy extra cash ? These things should be decided fast before the series dives too deep into this absurd half baked story of many inconclusive ends. I'm only at episode 4, so maybe it got better, I honestly don't know, but I'm losing my initial interest. And it's a waste for such good talents.",IMDB,Not boring but something is off,10.0
"Its started off ok but went completly downhill after they completed their first mission. They delivered a box to a high society party and left it in the kitchen. It was a cake which we obviously knew was a bomb. The main characters thought it was just a test. Anyways....as they walked away the bomb exploded and took out half the house. The main characters didn't care that they just killed many innocent kitchen staff??? It was a birthday cake....perhaps kids could've been involved in the party. Yet they walked away like it was nothing. Why would we care about these two characters after this, let alone the rest of the season. Not only is the script bad...the actors have no emotions and are very unlikable.",IMDB,Doesn't make sense,7.0
"I see so many complaints on here about ""I watched the first couple episodes why do they characters have no chemistry"" like yeah dude obviously they don't have chemistry,they just met eachother and now have to act like they're married.the actors do a great job of showing the awkwardness at first and slowly developing chemistry naturally.it's a well shot show that's not hitting you over the head with insane gags and over the top jokes,it's got a sleek feel to it but that shouldn't be a surprise since hiro murai and a bunch of other creatives from Atlanta are involved, better than the mr and Mrs smith movie if you ask me.",IMDB,Wow people are shallow,3.0
"It's chill. Wasn't expecting it to be over the top since it's a series & not a movie, no need for a fast pace. Nice to see Danny Glover take on a lil extra than his normal acting roles. It's like watching an everyday plain couple that have cool professions unlike Brad and Angelina. The super sexy plays well in the big screen. Small things like that help distinguish the two and gives the show its own take.Laughing at all the disappointed reviews because it's not like the movie when the movie WAS A REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES FROM 1996.

"The writing is horrible, the acting is the worst. I've seen better acting in elementary school plays! Wooden acting from beginning to end. Even in the opening scene it's like the actors dont even care that they're being shot at. The best acting in this episode is being done by the cat and some of the plants and trees in the background.What is with the dialogue in episode 1? The main characters spend so much time talking about absolutely nothing! They are not likeable at all and there's zero chemistry between them. Did the producers of this episode even watch it before they released it?! I found myself checking the time every 4 minutes. The first episode was torture. And if you look at the trailer for season 1 it looks like more of the same terrible acting and boring pointless action sequences.",IMDB,Episode 1 was difficult to sit through,7.0
"Yes, this is a ""remake"" with a more diverse cast. A certain group of people seem to instantly disdain every project that qualifies for this TV/Film industry trope. Of course, many of those projects deserve extreme criticism because they are cheap, hollow, cash-grabs, but this show is anything but that. I've been following Glover's work in TV for awhile. Atlanta was one of the best departures from the formulaic muck that we mostly see in TV. This show is similarly fresh, funny, and exciting. It reminds me more of The Americans than its source material. The writers did a great job of giving the central relationship legitimate emotional depth. I think their personalities and grievances with each other are something most will find relatable. Although, a part me felt like watching cool spy stuff centric stories like in the earlier episodes more than the relationship oriented later episodes. Regardless, this is way more fun than most of the other stuff out there.",IMDB,"Breath of fresh air. Lighten up, guys!",7.0
"Can't believe all the possibilities wasted on this one, poor script, poor acting. Maya Erskine Is a totally wrong pick on a series like this, she looks like +50y even though she's 36. In their profession they should be able to seduce other people too and by her looks it would be almost impossible.It's a bit a mixture of interesting elements and possibilities you hope would somehow happen in the series but quite rarely anything happens.But overall huge potential but not much delivered. Basically can't understand why they even did this. Luckily it has only 8 episodes and fingers crossed there will not be any season 2 ever.",IMDB,Boring,7.0
"It's not like amazing or spectacular, but it's pretty good. Solid writing and storytelling, although a few holes and bleak characters but nothing major. I just feel like they leave out a lot to focus more on their relationship. Chemistry and performance are great. I like both actors and they did well in this. It is somewhat realistic especially the part about their relationship but the spy part has a lot to improve, like obnoxious gun fights, or main characters being bad and then good and then bad at their job. But I thoroughly enjoy it and I enjoy that it's slightly mysterious.Creators did well. This show deserves more than 4 stars.",IMDB,It's pretty good. What are these guys talking about?,8.0
As someone who was a fan of the original movie I can definitely say that this is not a rip off or a full a real managing it's a reboot in every sense word it takes what was so successful about the film and does not copy it at all I thought this series was very cool and fun and original but it also pays respect to the film which is pretty great there are nice references and nods to the original film that I thought were cool but it's also its own thing and I definitely hope the way it ended it gets a season two this show has Potential I also thought adding the fact that It added something new by Creating other Smiths within the world of this show.,IMDB,Not a ripoff of the original movie,7.0

"I really enjoyed this series and thought it was great that with a relatively limited cast it felt like a huge production. It kept me hooked the entire way through, however, the ending was so frustrating! Some people might really enjoy how it ended but for me I was just such as let down of an ending after such an incredible build up. However, the case did a great job throughout. I laughed a lot, was on the edge of my seat at times and it didn't feel too predictable. The pacing worked well, it didn't feel too rushed and each episode kept me wanting more.

"My sentiments regarding this show are pretty well summed up by most of the 1 to 3 star reviews. I used to think of Amazon as the potential No 2 after HBO Max - we still rewatch gems like Catastrophe & Red Oaks - there was a time 6-8 year ago where Amazon was doing really interesting projects with great people. That's changed.Also, I should point out, not all, of the reviews echo my thoughts - I mean I don't think DEI had anything to do with this if you know the history of this project: Amazon just had Donald Glover on a 360 type development deal (same reason they put out his project 'Hive' not long before) along with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who was originally meant to co-write and be Mrs. Smith opposite Glover, and both chose this project to work on together, but she dropped out due to ""creative differences"" lol.This was a smart move by PWB if I've ever seen one, and it makes sense - I find PWB to be one of the most insufferable on-screen presences working right now, she is just nails on a chalkboard to us, but she's also, imo, one of the most brilliant young writers out there. Just look at what happened to Killing Eve soon as she left! I also didn't like Fleabag really, but can also recognize how good it was. So despite the paycheck, PWB still said ""hell no I want no part of this garbage"".There enters, the actress whose charisma rates somewhere between a dead moth and a used Q-Tip. Should've known it was all downhill from there but because I have been a big fan of some of Glover's work - I find him VERY hit or miss, I love his soul/R&B music but hate his rapping (shout out to 'Palisades'), he was great on Community, and S1&2 of Atlanta was a revelation, before they got too high on their own supply and fell off a cliff - but he seems to be a little too into himself after the early success of Atlanta. Saying his show was 1B best of all time to Sopranos is just moronic and patently untrue (even as an NJ Italian I can't in good faith put Sopranos as a definitive without question No 1, but that's another topic) but it also showed where his head is at. I've found that when a writer or anyone involved in storytelling specifically starts talking that way, it usually doesn't end well. Criticism and editing are such a big part of the process, and thinking you're essentially the best ever just doesn't work.Anyway I've rambled enough but now it's time to leave the bathroom so - yeah...don't watch this. I didn't finish the S1 but it was horrendous and I finish just about everything.",IMDB,Amazon Prime...What Happened to You?,2.0
"This is NOT a Brangelina remake, this is a Bakula and Bello remake, a 1996 TV series which inspired the 2005 film. I think this has misguided a lot of opinions regarding this show, especially considering how vastly different this series is to the movie.Erskine and Glover have exceptional chemistry together, and this really acts as the backbone to the show: this isn't a story about spies, it's about marriage.The whole cast did an excellent job and the numerous cameos were fun and appropriately placed, whether featured in a mission or as part of the Smiths' marriage story.This series, although a slow burner, is fun, thrilling and funny! The comedy is really well written and it's not too obvious, which lifts tension off a lot of darker scenes. I think that the structure of the show is excellent, with clear character arcs and a clear narrative. Nothing is over complicated which allows more focus on the characters.I'd really recommend watching, a really enjoyable series with fantastic cinematography!! The final episode was so thrilling and a nice touch to finish the show. Yes, it takes a little warming up to in the first episode, but the series is definitely a hit and something unexpected.",IMDB,A remake of the series: not the film,8.0
"I rather liked the interaction between the two main characters. I even liked the therapy episode, which did not go down very well with some reviewers. I like the way that the therapist was played..I agree with other reviewers that our main protagonists somehow do not seem athletic or combat ready enough to do the job they are meant to do. It is also implausible that some of their activities do not result in them being apprehended by law enforcement officers.The comedy, generally speaking, is not laugh out loud funny, but rather something that provokes a wry smile now and then. One or two moments caused me to laugh out loud, for example a roof scene.If there is another series, I ask that messages shown on phones are displayed more prominently please. I like to watch TV lying down on the sofa, and I had to keep getting up to lean towards the TV whilst pressing pause, so that I could read what the message was. There are quite a lot of messages and so this was rather distracting.But my overall impression was a positive one. I thought it was a bit different and quite quirky and I like quirky..",IMDB,Pretty good,6.0
I looked forwarded to watching this tv show because I really liked the movie with Brad and Angelina. The tv show has good production value but bad writing. The story is not fun but instead sad. It was as if the agents were picked off a fiver ad. These guys are definitely not the A team but instead the reject team.They are not high performers with great skills. They are unlikeable people with low skills and bad morals.The jokes are not funny they are clumsy. They do not even know who they work for. The requirements of there jobs are not clear. As a result the audience does not bond with the characters. We do not want to be them nor do we care about them.I guess I should have read about the writers intent with the show. They describe the show as married with children with guns. I guess if the jokes were not funny and there were no children.,IMDB,"Opposite of original, unlikeable casting",3.0
"The premise of this series is interesting, and the acting is very good. And it has some well-known guest appearances.Still, most of the episodes were WAYYYY too slow for me! Especially towards the beginning of the season. So much time spent with them talking -- and not even in an interesting way. Just talking on and on in a very boring way. The show could have been better with a little less talking and a little more action.I will say, though, that the slow pacing reminded me very much of Donald Glover's other series, Atlanta, with people talking on and on in a very monotonous, boring way. So, if you liked Atlanta, then you'll probably like this series. But it definitely wasn't my cup of tea, for the most part.Towards the end of the season the show picked up, and the last few episodes were pretty good. But, man! Those first few episodes were hard to get through! I gave up watching the show several times. I only finished the season because I wanted to see how it ended. But the early episodes were not enjoyable at all.This season ended on a very interesting note, and it'll be interesting to see where it picks up next season. I may watch a little just to see where it goes. But I'm definitely not committed to this series.",IMDB,A decent series but way too slow,7.0
"FRESH! Chemistry between the leads is electric. Jokes land. Action is thrilling and realistic. Directing and writing are elite. Pacing is fluid - 45 minutes goes by in a blink. There is depth to the characters, inspiring care without the use of manipulative emotional contrivances. Tons of awesome surprise guest stars that often steal the scene. The setting changes from mission to mission and the exotic locales are beautifully captured. And what is most refreshing is that this show knows exactly what it wants to be. Instead of pandering to audience metrics for general commercial appeal, the vision seems uncompromised, and in a time when most entertainment is more marketing than art, we have Mr. & Mrs. Smith to balance the scales. I'm truly appreciative of these filmmakers. This is high quality storytelling that I hope more people come to understand and enjoy. It may not be for everyone - I get that not everyone will find this different take on the titular characters amusing or exciting - but I absolutely do.",IMDB,A show that knows exactly what it wants to be...,10.0
"The first few episodes were honestly quite underwhelming. It felt pretentious, the pacing was slow, poor chemistry between the two leads. We get to experience the early stages of Mr & Mrs. Smiths relationship that is borderline awkward, but not in the endearing or romantic way. Around episode 5 things start to pick up in terms of pacing, more action-filled missions, higher stakes, and improved humor. The main characters also get some depth even though the chemistry still remains lacking.Overall a decent action/dark comedy series that won't blow you away but neither will it put you to sleep, especially the second half. Hopefully a second season can keep the momentum.",IMDB,Second half much better,6.0
"The TV series is a large departure from the film of the same title, but this works to its strength as a fresh and unique reimagining of a Spy-Couple concept.This isn't a brainless rolling shot of pure action, but instead focuses on the human relationship of two characters brought into a world grounded with realism but decorated with imagination and creativity. With smart and funny writing taking the lead, action is used as a fun adorning instrument - I really fell in love with the show.The chemistry between both lead actors was unexpected but delivered brilliantly, as was the acting across the series. The world-building/plot doesn't take itself too seriously but brings intrigue. The stylish execution both visually and emotionally ties it all together. The tone walks at the intersection of many genres but manages to pull it off.As a series it really does bring something new to the scene in a similar fashion to The Brothers Sun or Beef; personally I loved it and recommend it.

It put an amazing spotlight on the characters and didn't just show how the two characters worked together but how they tried to fight for eachother.

I was mortified by this scene, it was completely unnecessary.People might say it was necessary for a pivotal point to make jane angry, but couldn't we have started with John and an attack on his mom where he thought it was Jane?Other than the death of Max the show was exciting, bit funny, and overly honest about relationships.

"This show has nothing in common with the 2005 movie and that's OK. I don't understand people giving negative reviews solely because it's nothing like the brad and angelina movie?? It's not supposed to be the same thing. This is a cool and witty dramedy, it's not action packed like the 2005 movie and that's great; this has its own charm.John and Jane have failed at earlier attempts at careers and relationships, and they've accepted a position at a mysterious, unnamed company that interacts with them through the distinctly 2024 method of corporate communications written as casual, friendly text messages. (They call their employer ""hihi"" after the way they're greeted via text.) But there are no big clues that simmer quietly in the background, and there's almost no urgency in trying to track down What's Really Going On. Mr. & Mrs. Smith is not designed with the propulsive, ever-heightening momentum of an action movie.

"Created by Donald Glover and Francesca Sloane (Atlanta), we follow John and Jane Smith, two young fresh recruits into the company, an international spy agency which pairs them together, acting as husband and wife. A fun twist on the story some already knew, what we have is really quite unlike any iterations before it in good ways, and I quite appreciated its homage and return to more episodic writing and the elusive nature of any of its world building, where we really do learn very little about anything behind the curtain. Ironically as an action series and a romance series individually it doesn't quite nail either, with much of the action sequences being almost indirect, quick, or relatively non-believable. The romance relying heavily on the chemistry between the two leads, it works enough, although as the series makes a heavier emphasis on the two's relationship it improves, though the pacing sways wildly. Together with the world they've built somehow it does work, with little things like constantly talking about their highly sensitive work at full volume in public and always getting away with it, to professional guns who seem to never make a single shot, a lot of it borderline parody. The obvious elephant in the room is Phoebe Waller-Bridge, an original partner and creator behind the show who stepped out relatively early in production due to creative differences, and her voice can still be felt strongly in some of the scenes and interactions. Unfortunately Glover's focus seemed to be on John, so he tends to be more of the main character because of her departure. Maya Erskine, who played Jane, was great, honestly a better performance than Glover in my eyes, but I would have loved to see Waller-Bridge in that role, I think she would have given the entire thing a tone and perspective that felt lacking in the final product. Overall, as an action its okay, and as a romance its fine, but as an overall fun time, yeah its pretty good. If you're coming solely from the Jolie / Pitt vehicle I'd hesitantly recommend, if you're coming from Atlanta I'd likely recommend, and if you're coming from 1996 Scott Bakula series, wow, I'm impressed, like who watched that show.",IMDB,Good,7.0
"The low comments, the low reviews are just from people who don't understand who Donald Glover is. The show has nothing to do with the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie movie. This is its own thing, it's actually going in depth and taking its time with the characters and the plot. The show is proving that you don't need to have super attractive actors to play spies, or to be in a romantic situation. The comedy is clever and grounded. The show's realism makes you feel like they could be real people that you would see in every day life that are on this mission but you would never know. The show was awesome.

There is actually one episode where they meet an older snootier spy version couple of themselves over a snooty New York dinner, with only 5 minutes of spy stuff at the end.If you like art house indie movies about the ups and downs of a relationship with a bit of spy stuff, this is your glass of wine, but if you to relax this weekend watch Reacher, or Mission Impossible with your can of beer.",IMDB,weekend escapism...not here.,8.0
"Finished this 8 episode series in two sittings, which is a rarity for us; most episodes clock in around the 40 minute mark, so they're not tediously padded out.Anyone expecting this to be a crash bang wallop adventuring romcom, like the original film, will likely be somewhat disappointed by this. This version of M&M Smith is heavy on the dialogue and exploring the relationship between Jane & John Smith as the assume their roles as married assassins. Initial curiosity about how they'll make things work, who does what domestically, and how far to take the marriage aspect of things eventually progresses towards a more evolved relationship and all that entails.They're charming. How can they not be when Glover and Erskine play the relationship side of things with such ease. While their first mission seems simple enough, it quickly lets them know they're in a high risk profession. With a new mission each episode, it's not hard to binge a few episodes at a time; the missions seem to escalate in difficulty just as the arc of their relationship develops, their lives becoming more challenging as things progress.Both of them are good company: he's chilled and not as sure of himself as he lets on, while she's dead-pan and more sociopath with a heart of gold leaf. The missions are varied if relatively straight-forward, with some nicely gauged cameos. Thankfully any shoot-outs are kept to a minimum - when they're extended they tend to resort to the good guys being tediously dull one shot wonders (when the plot needs them to be) while the bad guys are disposable and inept (when the plot needs them to be) ... can this be not a thing anymore, please, it's lazy and any semblence of something being mildly thrilling is reduced to the ho-humness of inevitablility. A fing awful trope.Erskine and Glover carry the weight of the show lightly, the ups and downs of the relationship and it meets personal and professional obstacles is neatly judged. The locations make it stand out from those generic mission based shows that always seem to use a few stock establishing shots before resorting to generic studio interiors.Mr & Mrs Smith are jolly good company. Looking forward to seeing what kind of approach the writers might take going forward given the final scenes.",IMDB,Straight Talking Hitsters,6.0
"He walks around like he gotta dookie in his pants, like he should be wearing a still suit and he's filled it to the brim. Bros got weird posture. Muad dib the prophecy!Also this show is weird typical prime garbage. Some executive had the bright idea to use the name of that bradjelina movie from a decade as the title to get more eyes on it but absolutely makes no sense and just set expectations wrong. If you don't believe that you are just wrong and are not cynical enough to understand most things.

"Starring Donald Glover and Maya Erskine, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' serves as an adaptation of Doug Liman's 2005 action-comedy film of the same name. While the show boasts plenty of action with longer episode runtimes, it falls short of replicating the magnetic on-screen chemistry exhibited by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the original film.Created by Francesca Sloane and Glover, with Sloane also serving as the showrunner, the series introduces a fresh twist to the familiar narrative. Unlike the film, where the titular characters discover each other's true identities as rival spies, the adaptation sees Mr. And Mrs. Smith working for the same agency, forced to assume the roles of a married couple for their missions.The heart of the story lies in the evolving relationship between John and Jane, as they navigate the treacherous waters of espionage while grappling with newfound emotions. Their cover story as software engineers seeking therapy adds a layer of complexity, though at times, the counseling sessions feel drawn out, hindering the overall pace of the show.Nevertheless, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' excels in its action-packed sequences, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats until the gripping finale. Whether it's high-speed chases or daring missions, John and Jane prove to be a formidable duo, despite the looming question of their true allegiance.At its core, the series thrives on the palpable chemistry between Glover and Erskine, their on-screen rapport injecting a sense of authenticity into their characters' tumultuous journey. While the show may lack the sizzling allure of its cinematic predecessor, it offers a compelling narrative that will resonate with fans of the original film.In a nutshell, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' may be slow-paced and moderate in terms of entertainment, but it delivers a captivating blend of espionage and romance, anchored by strong performances and thrilling action sequences. So, if you're ready to embark on a rollercoaster ride of intrigue and passion, buckle up and join John and Jane Smith on their exhilarating mission through the streets of Manhattan.",IMDB,A Thrilling Adaptation of Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolies's Action-Comedy Flick !!!,1.0
"First and foremost the movie was mediocre but had some fun moments; mostly due to the main actors and ok action scenes but this show is just horrendous. Glover who can be good seems to barely be trying here. I've no idea who the woman is but she's duller than dull. The show has little action and zero suspense. The two MC's talk like they're in some dull art house drama movie about nothing in particular except random conversations. The people giving this high praises are a hoot to read in their pretentiousness. If you want to know what a properly entertaining comic, action spy show is supposed to be like watch Fubar. This show is on the other side of the spectrum in its tediousness and dull proceedings. The director must have been in a coma when he did this. Avoid unless you're an insomniac.",IMDB,Wow it really is bad,10.0

"The original comedy action movie with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, for me, created a huge expectation for the first episode of this series which quite frankly was, well, boring I'm afraid.I appreciate when you create a series rather than a film you have much longer to develop characters and story lines, usually with a much lower budget, but OMG this was so slow.My point being, if the characters hadn't been named Jane and John Smith there is no way I would have made the connection to the original movie so why not call it something else and instantly remove the pressure of viewer expectation?",IMDB,Why Call This Mr and Mrs Smith?,8.0
"This was such a great show. I love the original movie but I love how in depth the story is as it takes you deeper into the world of spies. The chemistry between Donald Glover and Maya Erskine is golden. I thought from their first scene until the end they were an amazing duo. Altogether the cast was great. I thought Ron Pearlman came in and stole the show a little bit. It's great to see him play a funny character instead of a tough guy. It was great how they paid a little homage to Brad and Angelina in the beginning. This movie truly has everything from action, comedy, drama, suspense. Overall great movie. I hope there is another season as they left a lot on the table to be explored.",IMDB,Smithtastic,7.0
"The new series ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" is a boldly different quirky adaptation of the 2005 movie. I liked it but did not like various aspects of it. It was hilariously funny sometimes, slow at times but surprising kind of like boring then unexpected intense action all of a sudden. Instead of white super sex symbols of their time ( pitt and jolie) as the leads, we have a mixed race minority couple with relatively unknown Maya Erskine as Mrs. Smith. This sort of made more sense as spies are suppose to blend in and NOT be noticed (who wouldn't notice Angelina Jolie stalking you?). But this was a production risk as viewers might have expected a standard Hollywood sexy couple instead of a more real and cute couple relationship.I did not like the vagueness of the story and hope that season 2 explains the various mysteries presented and not leave them as part of the quirky charms of the series. The assignments given to the Smiths are totally vague and ambiguous instructions and will have you head scratching constantly. The viewer will not know what the actual purpose of each assignment was. I did not like the Smiths' reactions to some of the (""accidental"") killings that they do because they seem to get over it quite quickly without questioning why the persons had to die or deserved to die.The couple relationship between the leads felt more real and romantic but weird! I guess you could say it was a real growing loving relationship between two atrociously flawed individuals! I could feel their pain and love but still think they're crazy!I found it odd that these assassin spies were so unprofessional in that they were very loose about their covers (they almost freely told others that they were secret agents!).Some will love the series if they don't expect it to be like the movie. It was an up and down ride adventure of ""real"" couple budding romance against the day to day work and life problems intensified to constant life and death! If you ever worried about being fired, think about if being fired meant they would actually KILL you!",IMDB,different quirky adaptation of the movie,9.0
"Unlike the not even very good but senslesly entertaining brangelina movie this is a seriously interesting and multi layered series with good to great acting of the main and suporting (Ron Pearlman) cast.The series unlike the movie is set around two spies working together set up as a newly wed couple by the same company.Told chronologically each episode unfolds a new layer of relationship between John and Jane Smith while starting their new career as spies and life as married couple that doesn't know or loves each other in the beginning.Like in his former series ""atlanta"" Donald Glover finds ways to mix serious topics and meaningful dialoges with comedic and funny moments in a mezmerizing way.",IMDB,Its a glorious re-invention rather than a remake,7.0
"I like the premise of the show, to highlight relationship issues, that naturally occur, especially in a marriage within the setting of two partnered assassins. It's very clever, and it's captivating. I just wished the entire time that the female lead would be slightly more likeable because I have a hard time empathizing with her because she's so incredibly annoying. Maybe that is the point, but I feel like the show could've been elevated by having a slightly more likeable female lead.It was because of that that I initially stopped watching, and then gave it another go because like I mentioned, I really liked the premise and I really like Danny Glover but I just cannot stand that woman. It's very hard to keep watching because of her but I'll continue watching regardless because I'm keen to see how it ends.",IMDB,Good show except for the female lead,9.0
"One of the best series I've watched. Nothing like I anticipated based on the movie by the same name with Pitt and Jolie. These two are not in the same league.Writing is excellent. Dialogue is natural, smart and funny as heck. The characters have surprising personalities, brilliantly done. It's immersive. Acting is flawless.It's classy and very touching. It's deeper than you would expect. It's fun and it's tragic. It made me laugh from my heart and got me teared up from the same place. It's quirky for sure.For me it's more than anything else a study into a relationship. An exploration of honesty and loyalty between two very different individuals.

"I went into the series with a blank slate, never having watched the Brangelina version. I immediately got onboard with the premise, two strangers recruited and thrown together as operatives for a murky espionage company. The question was, what tone would it it strike? Would it be serious? Comedic? It soon became clear that focus wasn't really the spy missions; those were simply the backdrop for what was the heart of the series, the feelings that Jane and John Smith were developing for each other.For me the chemistry between John and Jane was off-the-charts good. The writing was smart and insightful, and both characters quite endearing. Even if their missions could be somewhat cartoonish, with a slew of dead bodies in the their wake, the emotional content of the show was always real and authentic. Indeed, in the later episodes, the intensity of their feelings was sometimes shocking.I don't know if this season was a one off, or if there will be further seasons of Mr. And Mrs. Smith. For reasons that can't be discussed here, any subsequent episodes would have a different storyline than that of season one.Suffice it to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the series, and would recommend it.",IMDB,Surprisingly compelling,7.0
"I really thought this show was a lot like the movies, although it's more about the relationship and more of a comedy. The biggest similarities were probably the psychiatrist episode, obvi the murder attempts one one another, the character traits, Jane as uptight/ controlling, John as funny/ social, their agency turning on them, a neighbor with an agenda. I enjoyed the show more than the movies because it was more playful and artistic, ofc the show is newer and more relatable to the younger crowd (music, jokes etc) I liked that we got to know the smiths more in depth in the show, however I liked the movie as well. The two are different, but still very alike. The biggest differences is that the new Jane and John knew what they got into and went on missions together (putting a strain on the relationship) and the old Mr&Mrs had no idea who they had married and sort of had a reverse effect (trying to kill one another first, then going together) The new Jane and John only stopped trying to kill one another after the truth serum, but before that they were set up to think they tried to kill one another.Very good show and very funny, however I won't even get in on the ending. Season 2? Spoiler: Jane had one bullet, three were fired. They probably died, or did they survive ?I don't know.",IMDB,The similarities,1.0
"Watched one hour of the first episode - suffered through it is a better description. Incomprehensible because so much is not explained. Some sort of super secret spy agency is signing these two up for really cool incomprehensible missions to do really mysterious stuff running around New Yawk City. Why anyone would want to suffer wandering around New York is beyond me. Anyway, the very brief action sequences are punctuated by long, slow, boring sequences where the two look at each other and make irritatingly stupid small talk, or sometimes stare at each other and say nothing. James Bond type action and thrills this is definitely NOT. This is the video equivalent of the fatal radio mistake known as ""dead air.""

Once my guy told me, I can't tell of you like me or not! 😂 Of course I liked him! I see how John really loved love and having a family and there's a slight inkling of that in Jane. She is safe in her profession by having temporary encounters and no real intimacy. She's the queen of compartmentalizing! I feel that so much!

"Forgot I watched this a while back. Feel like it is more for fans of the Smith series than fellow Donald Glover fans.Don't get me wrong, he's solid in this....and there are guest drop-ins a plenty. I guess it's nice to see him operating with a huge budget. I don't think he booked this to get a series of location vacations, instead I think he did it for a chance to work with Maya Erskine. He even cops a move from her *outstanding* Pen15 series, and Donald has his real mom in a sweet role.As ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" features go, it has its moments. Ron Perlman as an aged proto-child for the Smiths was fun. Hard not to love Parker Posey, but wasn't crazy about her cross between GI Jane and a Stepford Wife.I assume Glover is creative even at a fast-food drive thru. So there are enough morsels here to satisfy a craving. Not sure I felt the onscreen chemistry between his and Maya's characters (compare the laughter in their promo interviews vs the laughter between them in the shows).I don't think the movie is a comment on online dating, but I kind of wish it were. And I definitely hope it is not a comment on the budget that the ""Deep State"" has.I *do* think it is an homage to the Smith Franchise, just not one I was jonesing for.",IMDB,Best if you're Jonesing for the Smith franchise...,9.0
Too many are watching this as if it is a comedy. This is a realistic scenario of strangers trying to get to know each other to make their jobs work. The perspective work in this is amazing. Every character is well thought out with what realistic personalities they cane have. Funny things occur because of this-but it isn't because it's trying to be funny. It just happens to be some potentially funny moments. This is psychological drama with spy thriller elements. I wouldn't rate this high as a comedy because it isn't a comedy.

"Having just watched the first two episodes I decided to see what the fine people of imdb had to say. First of all, the two leads are naturally awkward with each other as anyone normal person would be finding themselves suddenly married to a stranger. Their clumsiness with ""tradecraft"" would also fit if the audience makes the leap that the characters may not be experienced agents/assassins but, rather, people who the ""real"" agencies have rejected. I can't understand why some people seem to need inferred plot points signposted. The initial plot is slow to start but shows signs of picking up. Overall, two episodes deep and it shows real promise, will update after finishing entire season.Moving on to the plethora of negative reviews, don't be discouraged. Are you really going to be swayed by a review that states they could write better but make several basic spelling errors?

"I made it a half hour into the first episode and had more than I could handle. The writers and director should have been fired.

Then on a stakeout we are subjected to a lengthy inane conversation that is more than just boring, it repeats, over and over.

It was funny, played very over the top, and then all of a sudden it wasn't funny anymore, it was serious, straightforward, and it seems like all the development we saw these two go through is wiped away.

Most of the negative reviews are ones and they barely offer any real criticism besides blank terms such as bad acting or worst script I've ever seen and etc...This show is very good guys and its honestly better then the movie. This show has more depth and the acting is exceptional espically Maya Eskrine's. This show is good deep dive into a complicated relationship and while the spy elements aren't the strongest, they are still good. I would say for y'all to check it out at least before reading these reviews of dumb fanboys of the original movie.",IMDB,"Great show, don't listen to the haters.",10.0
"I really wanted to like this series, and episodes 1-5 were good fun. Unfortunately, from ep6, you are treated to them just arguing an awful lot, which gets really boring, really quickly.Also, the story is very much jumping around, you have no concept of time passing, lots of flashbacks to missions they've done (and largely bungled) but we've not seen yet. Their story also has lots of gaps, and it's jarring.Putting the morality to one side, they seem sociopathic and completely unlikeable. Their first ever mission together should've at least given them pause but nah, we live in a cool house now and are making mad money!Finally, again, we have a taste of ""Man- dumb, woman- really good at everything"", which is really tired. He even has asthma apparently and can't run for long??I can overlook the unlikeable characters if the episodes are engaging, but 6-8 really aren't. Won't be watching S2 if there is one.",IMDB,"Episodes 1-5 are great, 6-8 oh dear",7.0
"Such shallow reviewers. If you want to watch a Tom Cruise action movie or something with Jason Statham go watch that. This isn't it. And it's okay.Yes it's a little slow, but the characters have great chemistry, the jokes land, the dialogue is fresh and relatable. Not everything needs a hot white male lead and an overly attractive pucker lipped female (like the 2 characters in the pilot) fighting crime unrealistically. THAT's boring. Why? We've seen it before. Sometimes you want to see what it looks like when two normal people fall into this type of lifestyle and have to work through it. That's what makes this show pretty entertaining. It's not supposed to be the Mr and Mrs Smith you ""know."" Forget that and watch it for what it is. Also remember, Brad and Angelina's characters were at the end of their marriage. This John and Jane are at the beginning of their marriage, just having met. So the build up of their relationship is part of what makes it interesting and fun to watch. The show is great because the characters are relatable.",IMDB,This isn't Brad and Angelina. Get over it.,8.0
"Starts off promising with a violent shoot out and the assassination of Alexander Skarsgard and Eliza Gonzalez (a former Mr & Mrs Smith).Don't expect a spy & espionage procedural series. New recruits Jane Smith (Maya Erskine) and John Smith (Donald Glover) are set up as a married couple in a luxury double brownstone in NYC complete with wine cellar, panic room and of course, weapons.It takes a couple of episodes for the chemistry to build between this couple and viewers will have to suffer through slow dialogue, amateur spy craft, tourette like dialogue in stressful situations and a lot of bumbling. Almost gave up watching after the second episode but it does get better. Over time, the Smith's spy craft improves and each episode's guest stars make it more watchable: John Turturro, Billy Campbell, Parker Posey, Ron Perlman, Sarah Paulson, Paul Dano, etc...In the first episode, we learn John is a dishonorably discharged Marine with about $300+ in the bank while Jane tried to get into the CIA but failed. SPOILER: By the end of the first episode, a package they deliver turns out to be a bomb that kills 9 people, mostly innocent caterers in the heart of NYC. In the 2nd episode, they make a pact to keep doing this work until they build a tidy nest egg. They lack a moral compass and they're naive. Even teens who join a street gang know once you're in, you're in for life and there are consequences for failures but not these two.If you make it to the last episode, all is explained plus a cliff hanger that hopefully renews them for a second season. SPOILER: Max, Jane's cat, is killed.",IMDB,Awkward and slow initially but gets better,6.0
"Another commentator here reminded me of that movie and he was kind of right. It's less like the movie with Brangelina and does not even try to be it.Short: it's about intimacy between two people.They could have put the plot everywhere, but they chose to confuse the people and make some fun of it if people are able to open their eyes and ignore what they expected.Nonetheless: I like Donald Glover and it just takes some adjustment to find him and his message in the surreal plot.The surreal story around reminded me of the feeling seeing Severance, Cowboy Bebop and others.Whatever: Just watch it and ignore the title and anything You associate with it. No sense to read what people try to interpret in it.I watched it in two evenings and it was worth it.",IMDB,"War of the roses 2.0, but with Donald Glover ;) like it or leave it",8.0
"When you are using the same name of a spy thriller, action movie featuring two extremely good looking and high chemistry actors, you better bring it. I felt like this version did not bring it. Instead, they focused on the relationship building aspect. This isn't to say it's not interesting, but I found myself skipping some long drawn out dialogue parts just to get to the next thing.There are some notable plot holes and a few goofs but nothing extraordinary (Goof: While texting her boss, she types ""due"" in her phone only to see ""do"" on the screen, indicating she wasn't actually texting anyone). They also gain crazy skills out of nowhere, and AFAIK there's no indication just how long they are together - the sense of time passage is missing. Maybe that's my fault for forwarding some dialogue.While Mr and Mrs Smith starring Jolie and Pitt was amazing and did feature some couples therapy, there doesn't really feel like enough of a connection here. Mr and Mrs Smith in the movie was predicated on the notion that the spies were unaware that the marriage wasn't real and that the other was a spy. It was Spy vs Spy. In this series, both know they are not really married, but it feels like they fell in bed together right away and right away they are acting like they are married, even at home. While both actors seem more than capable of pulling this off, Jane is too broken emotionally and John is too vanilla for either of them to be more than caricatures of one person's imagination. Neither has anything interesting about them, they are bland people, and the entire series seems to be about their AI boss matchmaking.",IMDB,A Rose by Any Other Name,6.0
"Couldn't make it through the first episode without fast forwarding. Sooooo slooow. Main characters have no chemistry. The main characters spy craft skills were terrible, no obfuscation skills whatsoever. They stuck out like sore thumbs. Their interactions were flat at best and painfully not humorous. I could not get to the end fast enough to end this unfortunate poorly done prime show. Very disappointing, I had high hopes to watch a well made fun series from prime, I guess it's not to be. Unlike other viewers, I will not make it past the first episode. Just too painful to watch. No way to recover that wasted 45 minutes of my life.",IMDB,Soooo Sloooow. No chemistry,1.0
"Much like Barry or Killing Eve, this show takes the run-of-the-mill action drama and makes a dark comedy character story. The 2005 Mr and Mrs Smith suggested a war of the roses type comedy action about love, marriage and partnership. This show actually goes the distance in doing that. Hats off to Sloane and Glover. It's genuine, hilarious even in the darkest moments (Sarah Paulson was killing me lol), and has some seriously beautiful moments about partnership. Even the action sequences are full of unexpected and incredibly tense spy moments. That being said I can see where people looking for a John Wick action thriller might be confused. Nothing wrong with that, but this series will mean a lot more when you think back. If you loved Beef, The American or some of the shows I mentioned before, then you'll definitely enjoy Mr and Mrs Smith. Hope to see a season 2!",IMDB,So much more than a reboot,10.0
"An interesting show. Slow at times, fast at others. Good story line, funny, sad, touching, that rooftop wasn't that high, etc. When max was killed, i thought they'd use their hate for Hihi to attempt to destroy him in season 2 and then reconcile and resume their place in season 3. This way it would have kept us on the edge of our seat with the last episode as a cliffhanger: why there so many shots as she only had one bullet? Clearly she failed. Nope. One season with this John and Jane. Sad really. Now I'm not too keen on watching another season, if there's one, knowing that the new couple will not pass the season.",IMDB,Why kill them?,6.0

The first two minutes were promising , then lo and behold, decent actors get killed off (I bet they're glad) and we're left with this total drivel. I would normally watch until the end but this is far too painful to sit through. Life is too short to waste on this utter nonsense. Please,please don't make a second season !!",IMDB,Why ?,1.0
"With an outstanding cast delivering top-notch performances, this show shines with its crisp writing and captivating soundtrack. It respects the audience's intelligence, diverging from its namesake movie-earning it accolades. Fans of series like Patriot and Slow Horses will find much to admire in its nuanced storytelling. However, those in search of relentless, high-speed action might want to look elsewhere. Its unique blend of character depth, plot intricacy, and subtle humor sets it apart, making it a standout choice for discerning viewers seeking quality entertainment. Enhanced by visually stunning cinematography, it's a feast for both the mind and the eyes.",IMDB,Grounds the concept into a much more enjoyable show. Happily suprised.,9.0
"As long as there is not an expectation of feasibility, it's an enjoyable series to watch. The acting and chemistry of the two Smiths' (Glover and Erskine) make up for the unlikeliness of the stories in each episode. I feel the writers could have toned down the wild west gun slinging which would have improved the series without loosing the impact of the storylines and original humor. The settings are akin to James Bond which I guess is pretty much mandatory in a series like this. Some reviewers did not like the frequent slow pace but I like to think it helped build up to the climaxes and gave time to highlight the interactions between the two protagonists.",IMDB,Fun even if improbable,7.0
"Contrary to what most reviewers on here say, I found this series really enjoyable and, yes, also funny. This isn't all out, fast paced action and it isn't a run of the mill spy spoof. The pacing is slow, sometimes maybe a little too slow, but it delivers a complex, somewhat believable and at times hilarious relationship dynamic. The relationship between the two main characters is what this show is all about and Glover and Erskine both deliver outstanding performances. The emotions, especially laughter and joy, feel incredibly real.I was not a 100% convinced by some of the action sequences, especially in earlier episodes. I felt some of the directorial choices were a bit odd in those. For example, early on in episode one there is a shootout on a porch, in which someone pirouettes into cover behind a pole that is barely broad enough to cover a quarter of their back or so. Little choices like that, sometimes add up to it feeling like action might not be the forte of everyone who directed an episode of this show.That being said, I thought the the arc of the series as a troublesome marriage dynamic delivered some absolutely hilarious moments. The way the show's episodes are based on episodes of the relationship (such as ""should we have kids?"" or couple's counselling), with the addition of an absurd spy life twist, is thoroughly enjoyable. The episode featuring Ron Perlmann in particular is some of the funniest TV I have seen this year.",IMDB,"With complex relationship at the heart of it, the appeal is largely down to fantastic acting by Glover and Erskine",8.0
"John and Jane Smith, in this rendition of the concept, are not your usual spy movie characters. They aren't glamorous, quasi-omniscient, or even particularly competent. So far so boring. And yet, these very contradictions were enough to interest me. Early on, we learn (but John doesn't) that Jane was rejected for a job at the CIA. Both of their motives are murky for applying the job that turns them into Mr and Mrs Smith. Why are they there? Why were these utterly ordinary, not very likeable, people picked for this job? The nature of their employer is unclear. Is he/she/it good? Bad? Just messing with them?There is some humor in the concept, although I'm not sure about the execution. Jane and John (but particularly Jane) have a very bland, mundane way of interacting with each other, as if they are not spies in a high stakes job at all, but just office coworkers trying to get through the workday without awkward interactions. Indeed, at one point, Jane watches a clip that appears to be from the reality show ""Naked and Afraid"", and that's when it struck me that the rhythm of the characters' discussions was like contestants on a reality show. Just ordinary people, stuck in an awkward situation, created by their own (somewhat questionable) choices.I think the main problem with the show isn't the acting. It takes skill to be as dry and closed off as Jane is; I think the actress actually does a nice job here . Meanwhile, John is emotionally open enough that I felt like there was some decent conflict and contrast between them. For me, the problem was the pacing. It really was just too slow. I think this comes from the characters. The characters have a mission to do and we don't see them prepping for their mission at all. Even not-very-competent spies should realize, once they've caused on explosion, that they really should be working out some game plans, maybe a few visual signals, have some discussions about how to mitigate risk, who will carry the serum, etcetera. Instead they talk about bagels. It might be important character development that we are being shown these people are too stupid to prep for their mission. But, I would rather watch them just prep for their mission, otherwise why am I watching a spy show?I'm not completely uninterested in these characters. There's a scene in an early episode where Jane interacts with a neighbor. It's got some good mystery-building in it, but what I liked was that we saw Jane through someone else's eyes. I can't relate to Jane, or John, from inside their own perspectives. They aren't likeable enough. But I liked the idea that you could have these neighbors, they live in a nice house, they seem to work normal jobs, but you're pretty sure the woman lied to you when she said she didn't have a cat. You don't understand how they live in such a nice apartment, in an upscale area, for what their jobs are. They seem like very cold and untalkative people. You and your wife (or husband) joke that maybe their regular jobs are just a cover. Maybe they're actually professional hitmen. You laugh together as you sip your coffees. Then you shiver a bit and wonder if it would be better to sell up and move somewhere that's not near to them.",IMDB,Slow but has potential,6.0
Hihi. I'm calling this light satire. What I like is the lengthy quite natural dialogue about their relationship. Detailed chat but not forced or laboured or action driven about real topics like decision making and loyalty and caring. The light action is fitting for the good humour. The other very pleasing aspect is the exciting locations. The guest appearances are a delight. Donald is believable but his co-star is terrific. What do we say about men and women thrown together and fallng for each other? The same thing as spies needing to have super powers. I am sick of the intense scheduled exaggerated action shows. This show makes mock of those tired concoctions with gentle mockery.,IMDB,Confusing but Good.,8.0
"Nooooo!!!! I'm so upset!!! They killed Max!!!The series is slow moving....need more missions and such. I'm not a fan of the actress playing the lead. She is so ....BLAH. Wish Maria Bello was playing her again (she and Scott Bakula played the previous series...years back)
Also it's somewhat choppy and you miss chunks of a mission that you feel shouldve been shown. I also feel that the writer couldn't decide if they were to be serious or bumbling comedians. Feels like British writers wrote and produced this.This could've been done better.I did really like Parker Posey in here.I will admit the last episode was the best of all of them. It's like they saved it all for the last episode. And if course there would be a cliffhanger.",IMDB,Spoiler Alert,7.0
"This show is just plainly insufferable, it uses all the ""current day"" tropes in the most obvious way imaginable. It's not a show, it's a current day tropes vehicle.I have to admit that I couldn't make past the first 20 minutes of the first episode but I ended up skipping forward: someone made a boom boom and they run to hide and have more pointless, teenage-like conversations and reminisce like emo-teens.The male lead has been emasculated. She is an obvious girl-boss (copyrighted idea by Disney Corp and Co).The dialogue is vapid, just as their interactions, and everything else.Usually I would think that the camera work, the costumes, the music, CGI saved the day. Enough is enough with this kind of mediocre sub production vehicle for current day tropes ans political correctness. The only difference with other series is the amount of money poured in this production.I can't stand the slow piano and violins playing anymore.It's garbage, and that's an objective statement.",IMDB,Insufferable,1.0
"This is not a remake of the movie, but takes the same broad premise and takes it somewhere really interesting. Donald Glover and Maya Erksine are great in the leads, and there are so many wonderful actors making guest appearances (most of whom get killed off). Love the scenes with Sarah Paulson as their therapist. And love that Donald Glover's actual mother plays his mother in the show. Yes, it is violent, but also funny, and then surprisingly sweet and insightful about the real work of relationships and marriage. Also lots of great New York location settings.

"I liked the idea of this series. Thought that the 2 leads were well matched and a sprinkling of guest stars throughout.I enjoyed the first 3 or 4 episodes and then the show started to stall and really end up just being something on in the background. Had to see it through rather than enjoy.A lot of talking, not too much action apart from, again a sprinkling.The ski episode I thought was probably one of the best, Ron Perlmans guest episode, wasted him in the role he played but beautiful scenery, a waste of talent.Thought that episodes 6 and 7 were probably the worst.To be honest, I don't personally think it deserves a second season.

"Donald never fails. I had somewhat of average expectations going into this series because of the low iMDB scores, but I was so glad to be proven otherwise. This TV show remake of ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" movie (2005, never watched, probably will not watch for a long time), but from what I gather, it's nothing similar to the movie. The charming two leads, by DG himself and Maya Erskine seem quite perfect for the roles. The main part about this series that I loved was that it was first and foremost about the relationship. The action or any sort of spy-related business that was their work is mostly for the backdrop. The core of the series was always focused on the relationship. Seeing how their relationship evolves over time makes this show captivating. So any comments that lamented the lack of action (which I think there's still an adequate amount) compared to the movie can proudly label themselves as misunderstanding the series. The relationship issues that were presented in the series felt raw and real and very much felt like a dynamic that may actually exist. The ending was also beautiful as they finally reveal themselves to each other. They've loved under their masks but they were ready once again to be further vulnerable to each other. The ambiguous ending was also perfect for this show, while I secretly hope there may be a season 2. The overall comedic tone and subtlety were definitely up my alley and I loved it. The music by David Fleming also felt very fitting and modern. It's hard to find things to criticize about this show. Loved it and was certainly the best watch in recent months.",IMDB,Alana and Michael,9.0
"I can't get enough of this show. Simply genius how they humanized the couple and made Jane and John's dialogue so "" any normal married couple"" relatable .... their just kicking azz, completing mission after mission and surviving ego and jealousy in the meantime . Also, the leads are surprisingly great together. I wasn't sure at first, but by the end of episode 1 (maybe 2) I was completely sold. It's a weird chemistry that I can't put my name on, really weird. Lastly, the guest stars, from Pearlman, Posey, Paulson (alll the P's) and Michaela Coel, she can just stare endlessly and say nothing and you'll find yourself under a complete trance.

"After seeing a lot of the low rated reviews on here I can understand that people are going to compare it to the 2005 movie this is more like Atlanta and the 2005 movie smushed together. Unfortunately if that movie is your favourite you are not going to love this or it's pacing.The cinematography and flow is very comparable to Glover's Atlanta and the comedy is the most realistic I've seen on screen in a long time. A small conversation on a train where the two decide to share a room together had me rolling laughing.

While it ambitiously attempts to weave together action and deep relational themes, the imbalance in storytelling leads to a frustrating viewing experience.Lengthy dialogues about mother issues, insecurities, I'm better than you, marital strife, slow the narrative to a crawl, making it difficult for viewers to maintain interest.

"There is a lot to say about this show. The acting is terrible. From the very first scene till the end. Every episode is slow. The story line in each episode doesn't seem to have any correlation and doesn't give that exciting ""I can't wait to see what happens next"" feel. They make the guy seem very desperate and make the female seem like she has no personality. They lack that ""badass"" factor. The actors should have had more training with guns and shooting. They are very sloppy and don't make it look real whatsoever. Honestly, I was excited for the hype but it was an absolute let down. Nothing is ever as good as the original in my opinion. I gave it a shot, but honestly just a total waste of time.",IMDB,Absolutely terrible!,1.0
"I initially expected a rather silly spy comedy based on the comments, but the show has turned out to be surprisingly good. It's miles ahead of the movie with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. That's why it's garnered almost a 90% rating with critics on Rotten Tomatoes!The series boasts a captivating story, superb direction, and outstanding performances. With such a talented cast, it would be quite challenging to mess things up. Perhaps the only critique I agree with is that there isn't much chemistry between the main characters.

When you just look at the poster you think they won't be compatible, but their chemistry together on screen made each other better! I hope they bring it back! If they do bring it back of course they have to answer some questions about the ending first, but I also hope they keep the same format of them having a different mission each episode.",IMDB,People love to Hate,9.0
"As someone who's watched the movie version at least 10 times, I was very skeptical abt the new tv series. To my surprise, it's totally binge worthy. I've already watched this Mr & Mrs Smith tv series three times and I'll probably watch it again.Yes, it's very different from the movie but includes many of the fun scenes from the movie. The tv series is funny and action packed. The operations are unique and unpredictable. The ""get to know you process"" for John and Jane is relatable especially for those of us with trust issues. Glover and Erskine are great together!I hope the series is renewed for a second season. I'd love to see where the producers take the series.For those who disliked the series because it's different from the movie, I say, grow up and just watch the movie again. Or, look at it for what it is: ""inspired by."" It's simply a different interpretation of the movie. Much like the recent Sherlock Holmes-inspired series Elementary and Sherlock. Those series are completely different interpretations of Sherlock Holmes but are each great series on their own.As for the criticism that the lead characters do not have the same Angie/Brad chemistry, I say, who would? Angie and Brad are superstar sex symbols and were in the early stages of their love/lust affair. In the movie, John and Jane chose to marry each other and later found out that they're both spies. In the tv series, they're newly hired spies agreeing to marry another unknown spy chosen by the agency. It's like Married at First Sight for spies.And, for those who still can't handle a mixed race couple on tv, all I can say is join the real world - evolve or be left behind.",IMDB,Fun series!

Definetly not a action/spy show feel. Incredibly boring with hints about not wanting to talk to family members. Way to muching talking about getting to know each other.

"I do not understand the low ratings at all, the writing and directing is great with vibes similar to that of Atlanta with weird and surreal undertones. The leads are very humane and believeable, but bear in mind the show derives from the movies' plot a lot. I would categorize both leads as psychopaths that are very aware of it yet outside of their occupation they lead normal lives and come off as humane individuals. The lead actors have good chemistry, and give some scenes a very surreal touch. It's as much a character study as it is a spy thriller.I love it, give it a shot with little expectations.",IMDB,"Amazing, great dramedy with good performances for adults.",8.0

Who the hell would bring a child into their chaotic dangerous lives? We just can't get past how horrible their chemistry is together. Well, better yet, lack of chemistry! It isn't believable for one minute. After a few episodes we can't stand either of these actors and just hate the show.

"First of all, this ain't about rehashing Brangelina, this is a fun, sometimes awkward look at the spy rom com genre, watching this in a hotel room on a spa break and seeing Glover and Erskine bark like dogs is one of the more uncomfortable moments I will have in my life, but one fitting to the amazing bite me am I dreaming moments you will have watching this. Glover's writing is perfect and my wife and I both fell in love with his character a little too much, so much so I went out and bought a heavy cream cardigan afterwards. Erskine shines throughout as somebody you like but are very aware of how dangerous she is. Great premise, great cast and one to watch.",IMDB,Playful interpretation with some genuinely uncomfortable scenes,9.0
"Mr. And Mrs. Smith really comes across as a rom-com with a bit of action, while the Movie is an action-comedy, so you'll need to keep that in mind. But if you're a fan of Erskine or Glover you'll probably find it enjoyable.Erskine's acting is on point. If you're familiar with her you won't find it surprising that she brings a lot of range; she's great at bringing emotion when necessary and is really the glue that holds things together.Some of the dialog can be a bit slow at times and maybe slightly contrived. It doesn't always land, but there were some parts that had me laughing my ass off.Chemistry between the MCs is hit-or-miss, again mostly driven by Maya. I'm not sure about the rewatchability of the show - if I rewatch it there might be a couple episodes I'd skip. Soundtrack is OK but gives me EEAAO vibes which is weird.Overall I enjoyed it enough to binge, we will see how it holds up. Definitely watch if you like the lead actors.",IMDB,"You'll enjoy if you like the leads, deserves a higher rating IMO",8.0
"I don't know why people are bellyaching that this isn't just another show with endless explosions and muy thai. If you have watched Atlanta, or, like...the trailer, then you would know that this is going to be deeper and weirder than that.Personally, I'm loving it. I love the character development of the two leads and the surreal situations the initial set-up allows for. Using the spy premise to raise the stakes in otherwise fairly ordinary, realistic scenes between the main couple and a rotating task of wonderful actors is a great way to draw out the strangeness of everyday life. Plus, it's pretty hilarious to lean into the bougie hipster couple stereotypes in the context of sinister international covert ops. It's really an intelligent, funny, original show about relationships and power dynamics, with the occasional explosion. Enjoy!",IMDB,"Guys, it's a show from Donald Glover",9.0
"I'm shocked how bad this actually is. I find it hard that they have two actors that have absolutely zero chemistry with each other trying to play or recreate two characters that were so amazing like Brad and Angelina.TV show is extremely slow, I find it unbelievable that this was even made past one episode. The show makes absolutely no sense. The first episode could've been created in three minutes of video yet. They dragged out for their 50 odd minutes that this episode one goes for.Is absolutely zero chance that they will ever make a second season of this what could've been potentially awesome TV show. I do wonder was this show written by High School students because it certainly wasn't by the usual quality writers that we see in Hollywood.Honesty, I wouldn't even bother watching one episode of this. If you're reading this review, I'd move onto another show because this show will do nothing other than disappoint you.",IMDB,The reverse of the movie,1.0
"As someone who didn't watch the original movie but knows the premise, I thought this was a great watch; there's comedy, romance, and just some really good chemistry. The action was pretty bad but besides that it was a fun series.

"I watched 3 épisodes and couldn't stand any more.It is slow like a snail race... totally uninteresting stories / 'missions'
the actor play is close to null, making the characters totally blanks. Their games is bad, I mean really bad. Maya Erskine is really a bad actress on this serie and you feel she doesn't get into her character at all.All in all the serie is BORING.Whatch it if you are suffering insomnia : you'll fall asleep in no time.I really wasted 3 hours of my life watching this. What a waisted amount of money from Amazon to have paid for this.

"These are the ratings I'd expect if someone told fans of Pen15 or Atlanta to watch the original movie. And no disrespect to Brad who is one of the greatest actors ever and in many exceptional movies, even the Mr &Mrs Smith movie wasn't that bad for what it was, just not something I'd watch a remake of. This was advertised so hard as a remake, which is a shame. Hopefully people who are familiar with the works of the two leads will know better and give it a chance. I like the anthology feel where there were different new characters played by multiple exceptional actors (Perlman, posey, even Michaela coel!!), some of which come back throughout.

"A boring slogfest. Unlikable characters with no human qualities. If you're a sociopath you'll relate completely. Lacks any creativity whatsoever. I seldom write reviews but I felt a responsibility to warn viewers not to waste their time. The opening scene was senseless and unecessary. I could write a better script without a single second of training. Even the action scenes forced my finger to the fast forward button. John Turturro, an incredible talent, was wasted in one of the most cringeworthy scenes I've ever seen. Also watched with finger on fast forward. Here's how bad this actually is...if you gave me the choice between this and anything done by Tyler Perry, all of which is mindless garbage, I would pick T. Perry. I sense D. Glover is trying to be the black Q. Tarantino but failing miserably. I can't even give this one a nice try and if I could give it less than 1 star I would. Since Community D. Glover has been a huge dissapointment with the exception of his amazing turn in The Martian. You're all very welcome for the heads up.",IMDB,human?,1.0
"I was initially concerned about this being another poorly modernized movie turned into a series but found it to be a thoughtful exploration of relationship struggles (even if the couple is forced together). Great production value. Smartly written. I love that it's not a studio production on a lot. Car chases, gun fights, explosions tempered by real conversations about real stuff. I was waiting for them to turn on each other and wasn't disappointed with the cliffhanger. Chalked the slow pace to it being experienced strictly from the character's POV. No ""man in the chair"" or ""behind the scenes at HQ"" or ""villain's setting traps for the good guy"" filler you typically see in this genre.My advise: Give it time to build and grow on you.",IMDB,"Worth watching, don't expect the movie.",9.0
"It's too bad. I mean I really like Donald Glover. The show, I think is suppose to be taking off with the death of the previous mr and miss smith from the movie. They dont really say.It then moves into a weird recruitment storyline that is marginally amusing but rapidly turns into, as I said, Mostly unwatchable trash.The music is monotonous.The missions they are sent on are boring and mostly irrelevant to not just the audience but to the stars, Glover and whomever the girl is, themselves.Basically if James Bond was on Ativan, you'd have Mr and Miss Smith.Watch if ya like. I made it to three episodes and checked out.",IMDB,Mostly unwatchable trash,2.0
"Storyline wise this series could have done a better job, some things just don't add up if it were to happen in the real world. Nonetheless I had such a fun time watching this show. It shows how not all 'hitmen' (I guess we could call them that) act as mysterious and professional as James Bond, or Mr. And Mrs. Smith from the original movie. I think John/Michael was a very likeable character from the start, Jane/Alana did not really do it for me. Her personality was not likeable and every time John and Jane were in an argument I agreed with John which made their arguments less entertaining to watch. On the other hand, I loved the way this series got made. You can see there was a lot thought that went into the set and cinematography. Which is what made this series so worth it in my opinion.",IMDB,"Not Mr. & Mrs. Smith, nonetheless, very entertaining",8.0
"If you like witty, intelligent dialogue and performances, you'll like this. I've seen some other negative reviews here but after reading them I realised that their criticisms sounded irrelevant to me - eg referring to their fondness for the Pitt/Jolie film (which I've never seen). Clearly it isn't the film, it's just the same basic idea. Really the concept here is - what if a funny couple, who irritate each other and tease each other, were a couple of covert agents who barely know anything about who they're working for. Me and my wife are laughing a lot and enjoying it enormously. The dialogue is very good, very modern screwball comedy - it might remind you of Howard Hawks (or the way that Tarantino used Hawks-esque trivial/witty chat punctuated by violence/action). Anyway, the actors are good, the dialogue is funny, the action is pretty exciting - I hope there's more to come.",IMDB,It's really good,8.0
"If you just want to see Mr. And Mrs. Smith 2 in the serial version, it is not here. On the contrary, here you have the opportunity to take a new look at a well-known story. Of course, this interpretation has its drawbacks, but in my opinion, the novelty of the presentation outweighs them. I deliberately gave an inflated rating in order to level out what I thought were unfounded negative ratings. If the producers decide to give the series a second chance and continue it for a second season, it might make sense to allow the story to be developed with a different cast and a new crew. Let there be more TV series that are not similar to the original versions of the films on which they were based. Variety!!!",IMDB,This is not a remake.,9.0
"Writing is stupid .. I just cant find a less insulting word for it .. it is like the whole thing was written in less than a minute by a six year old from the special needs class .. acting is as done by the same child and his buddy from the same class with zero preparationaration, just on the spot .. it is just uncomfortable to watch and makes me cring as it would while watching a no-prep play from before mentioned duo. It made me feel bad and sorry for the creator and actors and to wonder how can they show their face in public after taking this huge dump on tv. It also made me feel embarassed for the people who created it and the two main actors, for putting a product of such shamefully low quality in the world. They should be ashamed, for sure. I usualy find a positive aspect in everything and I have none for this. It is just so bad and sad and embarassing in every way possible. Also boring, the atempt at humour that always failed without exeption was like watching a bad stand up comedian on stage unable to make the crowd laugh once snd just blabbing embarassing things .. so so bad ... brrrr.",IMDB,Terrible in every way,1.0

Looking forward to where this show goes next. Hopefully we dont have to wait 3 years. LolDonald Glover is so underrated as well, this really gave them both the opportunity to shine. Loved the quick cameos we got too from some wonderful A-listers.A lot of people are going to be disappointed that it isnt so PG-13 like the movie, its a series of its own, a great departure from the cinema version and much more realistic.",IMDB,Maya for the win!,10.0
"I loved the original movie, watched it over and over... not only is this NOTHING like the movie but you expect it to be funny with the cast it has.It's not funny at all and extremely boring. If you're looking for an action packed funny show.. look somewhere else. If your insomnia is hitting and you need help falling asleep this is the show for you!The idea is still good. 2 spies matched by an unknown agency get cryptic messages and jobs to do. They go from making rules about how they will work together and not get romantically involved.... But to know one's surprise they end up together.There are some great guest stars that are normally funny and awesome actors and yet there was no comedy at all. I watched through episode 5 and just couldn't watch it any longer. When you have a good actor like Ron Pearlmen and the only thing funny you do is have Mr Smith push him off a short roof.. then the rest of the time he's just whining and complaining..I really looked forward to this and really wanted to like it but sadly it's to boring to go any further.",IMDB,With this amount of comedic talent why is it so boring??,1.0

Some of the wants and needs that makes relationship what they are.Now you add that essence to the Mr and Mrs Smith film and you will start wondering ""maybe me and my girlfriend came become spies?""Donald Glover is amazing, and his co-star Maya Erskine complements him well.Give a try and disconnect yourself from what you previously known of the original film.",IMDB,"It's not the movie, it's a really good version of the movie",9.0

"I'm not sure why it's getting such low reviews. I'm guessing because it's supposed to be an action comedy. Really it's an action/dark comedy/romance so the wife is liking it. Also it's them going through a relationship from start to finish. Acting is great, and the stories pretty good there's some different things they could've done in the writing to make it more entertaining. When people easily die, when they could be easily saved, it makes it pretty boring. And one episode, they could've saved a guy and maybe made friends with him instead of him just dying would've been more of a story arc. With each fail could've actually been a positive.

"Unlike the successful film with the same name, Mr & Mrs Smith is not filled with comedic and witty banter, high-octane action and a celebratory tone. On the contrary, this is a slow-burn drama with brief moments of comedy, often spoiled by music and editing that add tension at a lot of the wrong times.The season starts with creative introductions and a decent first mission, but it doesn't take long to start getting puzzled with a lack of purpose. Both John and Jane have no formal training, no orientation, virtually no trade skills and, importantly, no chemistry as partners. This quickly leads to swaths of witnesses, evidence and damage in their wake - enough to beg the question why would anyone trust these missions to these people? They are pretty terrible at their job.John has some positive qualities, but Jane is a prickly, selfish personality that is not redeemed. The show exclusively focuses on their relationship, with stretches of boring banter and grim scenarios that lack comedic lift, suitable context or lack creativity while desperately trying to drive sexual tension while lacking any grand purpose. This leads to two conclusions: 1. They are expendable to their own story and 2. The writers are only interested in exploring the relationship between to the two characters, and not how they fit into the world.If this is what you are looking for, then you came to the right place, Mr & Mr Smith will give you some miserable grim situations for two people to find each other in. You won't find a smart spy series, a comedy or much action, which, given its name and marketing, one might expect.",IMDB,"Clumsy, slow-paced sordid drama",3.0
"This is a classic Donald Glover/Hiro Murai production. It has had a slow, awkward, and intentional tone, which is hilarious if you're a fan of these two.If you're looking for spy toys and high flying action sequences this show will leave you disappointed. It has plenty of violence and fight choreography in the later episodes, but the show never places it at the center. It's about relational satire and the absurdity of navigating a romantic partnership under literal life and death circumstances.For mouth breathers crying in these reviews about diversity in casting might be worth taking a look at who created the show?",IMDB,Don't watch it if you want an action packed remake of the movie,9.0
"Who in their right mind gave the go-ahead for this snooze-a-palooza?

You'll be out like a light before you can even utter the words ""lights out!""Seriously, it's like they distilled boredom into a TV show. If this were any slower, it would be in reverse. I've seen glaciers move faster than the plot development here. And the chemistry between the actors? Non-existent.

Forget counting sheep; just put this on, and you'll be catching Zs before you know it.

Some are worse than others, the double date episode wasn't amazing but still decent to watch though. The ending, without spoiling anything might piss off a lot of people. I still don't know what to make of the ending really which is why this gets a 9 and not a perfect 10 but it's probably the most realistic end to this show if I'm being honest. Overall the TV show adaptation of Mr and Mrs Smith was very surprisingly great and Donald Glover can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned.

People saying don't judge it by it's name. It's not the same as the movie. Then why is the name same? I wanted to watch it because I loved the movie. Number 1 reason of people who don't like is most likely because of they expected something similar for the series with the same name. I'm going to be honest I only watched 10 minutes and already disappointed that they killed the first couple. Swear to God I would've loved to see them as the lead of the series. They should make a spinoff prequel series about them. I am going to say this again why is it called Mr. And Mrs. Smith?

I'm convinced these two actors are the remnants of a bargain-basement, last-resort acting class, and their performances are more cringe-inducing than a middle school talent show.To sum it up, ""Do Not Waste Your Time"" should have been the official tagline of this TV-series disaster.

"Rarely am I surprised--in a good way--by a tv show or film. By the time I see things, there's been enough buzz so that I know what I'm getting, based on the actors, director, or genre.Which is why I didn't expect much going in. I had seen a few clips of Donald Glover from other things--and frankly was not impressed.This re-imagining of the Brad & Angie film is brilliant. The introduction of John and Jane is very effective, and allows the viewer to gradually get to like the two leads.The on-screen chemistry is bumpy at the beginning, but by episode 3, they are a solid, believable couple--like people we know.Each episode are different and present different challenges for John & Jane, as they continuously have to prove themselves to the mysterious company that employs them. My fav episode is the Lake Como assignment that, Episode 5, with Ron Perlman as the guest star.If there's any concern I have, it would be the finale episode--and it's ambiguous ending. There's talk online that if there's a second season (which I very, very much hope there is), it will have a New cast as John & Jane.I hope NOT. That would be a crucial mistake. Having hit pay-dirt with the current cast, asking the viewers to essentially go through the same process every season, will not work on this type of show.Bottom line: Well done, Donald Glover!

"Tl;dr If you wanted Mr & Mrs Smith the movie, or James Bond, or even Man from UNCLE, etc., then you're not going to like it. This is not a nostalgia spy movie the way James Bond has been in the last decade. It's a tv show in 2024.I enjoyed this show a lot and seeing the star rating on Amazon X-Ray I was surprised. I wondered if it was a race thing but I think what really makes it divisive is what people enjoy. As someone who has done deep dives into the spy genre, there are a few things to point out:They went harder against the Bond/girl trope than even the movie Mr & Mrs Smith. Jane displays a lot more ""masculine"" traits than John.Character development happens. Onscreen, off-screen, as time passes the characters change.There are no gadgets except a truth serum. Everything they do is roughly plausible given enough money/resources.It's a tv show. It's much more akin to Man from UNCLE in that it has different pacing to something like James Bond. That's how tv shows work.It's a bit more grown up. It faces real issues in a surreal setting, and follows them to their conclusion.Separate to that, I think that anyone who has followed Donald Glover through many/all of his projects would not be surprised by this show. Newcomers or those who have just seen Community might feel a bit jarred. I see people mentioning Atlanta, but I'd like to suggest This is America. It goes from soft comedy to darkness and back very fast.Warnings for animal death. Check doesthedogdie for more info.",IMDB,Would love a season 2!,9.0

Not an obvious choice, for obvious reasons. It was however nice to see a different dynamic in regards to the emotional and relationship side of a new Mr & Mrs Smith. Don't think we need a season 2 of this, though. Great ad and concept, however wouldn't recommend this.",IMDB,Mediocre,3.0
"I never write reviews, but this show deserves a higher rating than what it has right now. It's very well done. The script is great, the acting is great, the cinematography is great, and the directing is great. It's not too predictable like so many other shows are! It's action packed, but also very funny. The chemistry between the two leads is awesome, and all the other supporting characters are brilliant as well. What more could someone ask for? The world of streaming has inundated us with lazy and cliche stories we've seen over and over again, but this is something sharp, fresh, and intriguing. I really hope it gets renewed for many seasons to come!",IMDB,This deserves a much higher rating!,10.0
"While not perfect, this series is grittier and more believable than the movie. I wouldn't want to compare it nor expected it to be like the movie, but other reviewers seem to be making the comparison, so it is unavoidable.The movie was trashy and unrealistic. The series doesn't try to setup a couple unaware of the partner's profession. This makes the premise more enjoyable. There is mystery, action and humour.Yes, it is a little slow. But compared to most streaming content these days, it certainly isn't a weak point . It feels natural, allowing the characters to grow and become relatable, share parts of themselves and setup the mystery and humorous situations.Completely disagree with the low scores.",IMDB,Better than the movie,9.0
"I can see how people would either love it or hate it. It depends on the type of drama you're in to. Personally for me, I loved the chemistry, dry humor, and the intriguing relationship Maya Erskine and Donald Glover create together. Well-written from start to finish. Good job bringing together the little details and characters from previous episodes. Great scene locations in Italy and New York with beautiful backdrops and settings. Overall, a very refreshing and romantic story with a couple who are very different but seemingly perfect for each other. Looking forward to the next season! Bravo!!",IMDB,Loved it,10.0
"This is one of those series that you would hope it would get better at some point - by episode 2 or 3... Sadly it Never got better. The only good thing about it were the locations were they filmed. The characters are not likable, they had no chemistry, in fact they were absolutely boring. The stories were absurd and incoherent. Each episode ended in a blah... My recommendation is that you do not waste your time at all and watch something more entertaining like Reacher or Jack Ryan. I wish someone should've told me that. You have been warned. Watch it at your own risk, knowing that you will waste eight precious hours of your life.",IMDB,So Terrible...,2.0
"Love Glover's work and was not disappointed.Hilarious negative reviews here: ""Loved the first two minutes"", ""sick of diversity"". The whole point of those two minutes was to subvert them. They were a nod to the Pitt/Jolie movie, but also poking fun at it.If you're coming into this series because you thought the original movie was some masterpiece, you should skip this. I haven't thought about that movie since I walked out of theater. A fun, fine action flick, but nothing special. Might rewatch it when I'm hungover one Saturday.Glover took the concept and replaced the perfect action figures of the original with lonely, flawed leads. Still an action-comedy but the emotional stakes are the highest stakes, even when death awaits.Had a good ride throughout and was satisfied with the ending, whether it lives on for another season or not.",IMDB,Fun romp meets messy romance,8.0
"Major disappointment. Unlikable, seemingly sociopathic lead characters. Dark, seedy undertones, weird (albeit fully clothed) sexual scene I had no intention of watching, explicit sex scene I had no intention of watching (TV-14 how??), a post murder scene I also had no intention of watching. The absence of any action or thrills or comedy leaves me questioning why it's titled ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"".All I can say is, Glover and Erskine are great actors. Definitely capable of performing these character-driven scenes-the most compelling thing about the show. But that still doesn't leave me wanting more, so after having to skip through three scenes in the second episode, it's evident this show isn't for me. Therefore, I am done.",IMDB,Nooope...,4.0
"I absolutely love it! A bit of a slow burn at times but this show has everything you need for a good series. Believable story line, Mystery, suspense, humor, unexpected twists. The characters are real people. Not what you expect out of spy films but more of a chaotic story line that slowly creeps.Fun hints of dialog, characters and drama that eventually come full circle to creep you hanging on.Nothing like the action pact movie with Brad and Angelina. More of a lengthy artsy depiction of real relationships dynamics and sticky situations that make for a fun ride that leaves you satisfied enough and always wanting more until you actually get more. Expect the unexpected.",IMDB,Love it!,10.0
"Well... this tv show is good.. at first i was sceptical... even when i watch the trailers, and i feel like angelina and brad cant ever be replacedI tried not to watch this when it came out, but finally i give it a chance... first episode it was okay, and i give anither chance... and suprisingly i quite enjoy it...They are different form mr and mrs smith jolie and brad, the story and tv show dont try too hard to be their knockoff, its like.. fresh... new mr and mrs smith, i became a fan of them while angelina and brad still on my mind..So the tv show doesnt try to replace the movies, its more like a spinoff series...The series is good, fresh, funny, and i enjoy it, sometime i can relate to them also....i hope they will do season 2.. but i do hope they will do a bigger outdoor and action scene too..",IMDB,"It was good , not as i expected",8.0
"The dynamics between John and Jane is so fascinating to watch and is so relatable if you've been in enough relationships. From their initial meeting, to the honeymoon phase, to trying to navigate compatibility issues. Plus, the thrilling, action packed assignments adds to the story line. My favorite episode is when they ran into the other Mr and Mrs Smith. This is definitely a series worth bing watching and is way better than Brad and Angelina's movie version. I'm not knocking Brad and Angelina, but their personal drama is more entertaining than the movie. Please keep this show going into Season 2. I need more!!!",IMDB,I love this show!!!,9.0
"Super slow and boring, and the leads have absolutely ZERO chemistry. The only watchable part was the opening 5 minutes. I would have would have been more entertaining to watch Alexander Skarsgard and Eiza Gonzales sit in that old farm house staring at that ugly wallpaper for all 8 episodes. Donald Glover is a decent actor and musician, but is hit or miss with his entertainment output. Maya Erskine falls flat for me. She had no charisma as Jane, and zip her that she's supposed to be some kind of neurodivergent character type, but it doesn't work for a leaf in this capacity. It makes for a while lot of boring.",IMDB,"I don't care that is not like the movie, but bad is bad",1.0
"This television series is a stellar example of excellence in storytelling. With its remarkable director and executive producers at the helm, they consistently deliver top-notch entertainment. This particular show is no exception, captivating audiences with its brilliance. It sparked my interest in revisiting the 2005 film starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Surprisingly, I was unaware of Wagner Moura's involvement in this television gem. With its intriguing plotlines and exceptional performances, this series has left me eagerly anticipating each new episode. Give it a watch I promise you won't regret it.",IMDB,Great,10.0
"While the show has great location scenery and is visually beautiful at times, and has great music, it really is a waste of time. The dialogue is some of the worst I've ever seen... It seems like the actors are just improving everything, badly. The two leads have no chemistry together. The pacing and editing are baffling. One minute the main characters seem completely unattracted to each other, then suddenly they're humping, then suddenly they're in love, with no evidence of that relationship growth presented. The growth is just shoved in our faces as fact with no story arc to back it up. Then there is 40 minutes of that bad dialogue, then finally some build up to action, but then they complely skip the action and cut to the main characters reacting to the action that wasn't even shown. Did they run out of money for the non-dialogue parts?",IMDB,"Horrendous dialogue, no chemistry, bizarre skipping of action",3.0
"Okay, that was something. I've seen all the episodes, like it was a movie. I wanted to watch as many as i could. And i did it! All in one day (it is saturday so i had the time). Actors are good, you will recognize a couple of them. The storyline is catchy. In the beginning it made me a tiny bit depressed, so clumsy! But then it gets better, timelines are more streched out. They combined action/drama really good. Hopefully there will be a next season! I can really reccomend this show to watch. Maybe you can't manage it to see it all at one day..but if it is your day off you maybe will! Have fun.",IMDB,Triggers for bingewatching,9.0

It's funny, it doesn't take itself seriously, the action scenes are good and the characters are really endearing.The actors are very good, especially Maya Erskine who shows a wide range here.It might have been even better with a bit less of ""too much"" in the last episodes.

"I truly believe that some viewers are entering it with the expectation that it will be similar to the film, but that isn't how it should be seen. In my opinion, the show was superior to the film, with greater character development and excellent chemistry between the two leads. I would really love to see another season of this, as I finished watching it in less than a day. I really enjoyed every aspect of this show, and I thought some of the situations were hilarious.

There isn't so much chemistry between the actors either. No Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie here. I'm actually wondering if this is a similar premise at all.So, no mystery, no action, no chemistry... what else is there...no jokes either.The think is that it looks like they put some actual money in this.

"This is not a spy thriller comedy primarily. It is a show about a couple going through different stages of their relationship and reaching a boiling point before needing a catharsis like moment to finally open up and work through the issues. The action is secondary here, and people watching it should understand that. Although I must say that the whole mystery about hihi/supe and rival organisation is very intriguing and I would love to learn more in season 2.What I loved:
Whole couple's therapy theme (not just in that particular episode, but throughout the show)Music was superb. Kudos to whoever worked on that partGreat mix of fun and serious topics. The part where John started shouting on Jane in the forest by the lake was amazing, and cool to see how quickly the tone switches from Donald playing a person who is joking around to avoid talking his mind, and then finally bursting and spilling all the things he was holding backRon Perellman was amazingWhat I didn't like:
Fight choreography was not great. Even if this is not primarily an action show, it would be nice to make the fights choreographed better. I thought that paritucally Donald's fighting was not done well, it was too obvious when he was kicked and the way he moved from those kicks or punches, was over-actedToo many missed shots. People who are suppose to be good at shooting, miss too many times. The whole Italian episodes with people shooting at them from close range and missing. I understand that the action here should not be taken seriously as it's not a show rooted in reality, but still these parts bothered meOverall I really loved it, and hope amazon will renew it for season 2.",IMDB,Great show about working through couple's relationship stages.

"Some people here expected an action movie, but, unfortunately for them, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a story about the process by which two people can grow together, the things that keep them apart, and the work necessary to remain together; a process oft neglected today: marriage.SPOILERish~
The dark side of their work was a big aspect of their lives that made me want to watch to the end. Their supervisor is obviously ominous from the start, but they've done a great job setting up future story, if they are able to make another season or two.The examinations of both Mr. And Mrs. Smith were satisfying; the writers are not idiots, just not instant-gratification oriented. In modern media, writers are often blind to the less-than-savory aspects of their characters, but this show actually naturally discusses and addresses the flaws of both main characters, which is a lot better than many ""commentaries"" manage to do.On a smaller note, the writers engage with the more cynical sides of human nature without draining all affection out of the audience. The main characters are not especially stable people, and the writers are willing to complicate their emotions.SPOILERSI love that the writers did not take the modern approach to work/family balance, rightly noting the risks and sacrifice of a family life without discrediting the inherent desire for family that most every person has. Jane takes the stance of some modern people (not seeing the virtue of family), but her opinion is actually explainable, rather than merely being a voice for the writers.On an even smaller note, I thought that the solution to their animosity was obvious, yet so well done! Half of the show you're wondering, ""Will they just be honest with each other?"", and the truth serum is a straightforward, yet interesting solution. Darker shows tend to stick to being tragedies, but I appreciate that the writers have created a realistic comedy; the show follows the stereotypical story, but doesn't ignore the consequences of the choices the character makes.",IMDB,"Some slow moments, but a great emotional journey!",8.0
"I don't care about the ethnicity of the leads. I don't care that they (for some reason that truly makes no sense) named this show after a wildly popular movie when it has no connection to it or bearing on it at all. I do kind of care that there isn't a whole lot of actual action, and if it had more action that would have gone a LONG way towards a better rating. What I care a whole lot about is that this is show is simply poorly written, boring, long and drawn out and seemingly going nowhere.Will it get better? It would almost have to if it wants to stay on the air. But I won't be around to see it. I came, I saw, I was bored, I left.",IMDB,Just too bland and simply boring...,2.0
"Mr. And Mrs. Smith on Amazon Prime is a captivating addition to the streaming world, offering a fresh take on the classic espionage genre. Right from the first episode, the undeniable chemistry between the lead actors not only sizzles but becomes the beating heart of the show. Their dynamic performances elevate the narrative, making every interaction feel authentic and keeping viewers invested in their journey.The series seamlessly weaves together romance, action, and intrigue, creating a well-rounded and engaging storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat. The plot is filled with unexpected twists and turns, keeping the audience guessing and eagerly anticipating each new development. It's a testament to the writers' ability to craft a narrative that balances suspense with moments of genuine emotion.Visually, Mr. And Mrs. Smith is a treat for the eyes. The production team has spared no expense in delivering high-quality visuals and impressive stunt sequences. The attention to detail in both the set design and cinematography adds an extra layer of immersion, making every scene a visual delight.What sets this series apart is its ability to seamlessly blend genres. It effortlessly transitions from heart-pounding action sequences to moments of genuine intimacy and humor. The witty dialogue adds a layer of charm to the characters, making them relatable and endearing.Amazon Prime has truly hit the mark with Mr. And Mrs. Smith, offering a series that not only meets but exceeds expectations.

"This series is childish and amateur at best, spy agency? It's just another unrealistic candy coated drama for simple people. The acting is tepid at best and the premise is for people with zero concept of real world scenario, and the action, pathetic. This show tries to be cute and quirky for teenage girls and has no substance or meat. Definitely not for anyone looking for a true action packed or even thinking persons quality show. Statements like, I'm just happy to have a job and other tripe foreshadowed what I was in for. An agency hiring spys for real world scenarios does not grab people no one else wants. These two can't even stay on task for their first mission and glover is so smitten with jane he is constantly trying to figure ways to impress her. Huge waste of time and I am sure will be a hit with gen z's but anybody interested in substance should look elsewhere. And of course the page won't allow me to submit with less then 600 words somehow I have to waste my time writing extra stuff in order for this to be seen, which I must admit is clever because anyone thinking this isn't worth watching doesn't need 600 words but in order to convince others that it's worth it would require a lot of writing and convincing.",IMDB,Amateur hour,2.0

"I'm convinced all of the negative reviews are from people that wanted a carbon copy of the original film, something just as glamorized and flashy as its namesake (and don't get me wrong, there's certainly something to be said about that.

I went in knowing absolutely nothing about this version besides the original plot of the film and my trust in donald glover and maya erskine as brilliant actors.I finished the pilot episode wholly intrigued and tickled with the writing, their chemistry, and the entire dynamic of the show. The dialogue is so utterly realistic and charming that it makes you feel like you're intruding on an interaction between two very real people, and the pacing is perfectly done, it's snappy enough to be captivating without making you too breathless.If you're looking for an exact retelling of the 2005 version, you're not going to get it.

Yet others seem to think it was pretty decent because they had no expectations for it to reach.. struggling to explain my exact point here (this is why I don't leave reviews)... but look.

"The highly anticipated Mr & Mrs Smith TV show, inspired by the action-packed film of the same name, unfortunately falls short of expectations. Despite the potential for an engaging and thrilling series, the show struggles with a lackluster narrative, uninspired dialogue, and a peculiar take on the characters.One of the most glaring issues with the show is its tendency to prioritize romantic interactions over the intensity of the missions at hand. Instead of portraying the titular characters as skilled professionals, the series often veers into a strange territory where every mission feels like a forced date night. This approach diminishes the credibility of the characters and undermines the core essence of the spy genre.The conversations between Mr and Mrs Smith are a particular disappointment. Rather than showcasing sharp wit, clever banter, or engaging dialogue, the exchanges come off as flat and forced. The chemistry that should be the backbone of such a series is sorely lacking, leaving viewers yearning for the dynamic and compelling interactions that made the original film a success.Moreover, the pacing of the show feels sluggish, contributing to an overall sense of boredom. The lack of a gripping storyline and the decision to prioritize romantic subplots over action sequences result in a series that feels stagnant and fails to hold the audience's attention.The show's laziness is apparent not only in its narrative choices but also in the execution of its action sequences. Instead of delivering thrilling and well-choreographed stunts, the action scenes often feel half-hearted and uninspired. This lack of attention to detail in the action department further detracts from the overall viewing experience.Additionally, the show is marred by a stark contrast in performances between the main actors. While the male lead seems to be trying hard to engage the audience, injecting energy into his role, the female actor's lackluster performance is evident. Her portrayal comes across as disinterested and uninspired, creating a noticeable imbalance that further hampers the overall viewing experience. The chemistry between the two leads, crucial for a show of this nature, is unfortunately undermined by the female actor's seemingly indifferent approach to her role.In conclusion, the Mr & Mrs Smith TV show fails to live up to the excitement and intrigue promised by its source material. With a dull narrative, uninspiring dialogue, and a misguided emphasis on romantic subplots, the series misses the mark on what could have been a thrilling addition to the spy genre. While the concept had potential, the execution ultimately leaves viewers longing for the excitement and charisma of the original film.",IMDB,A Missed Opportunity,3.0
"Another remake I don't think anyone was asking for. All I knew was from the poster, that glover and Maya were in this, so I was going in blind essentially. I didn't know Alexander Skarsgård was in it and that was a pleasant surprise, and it only gets better from there. As I said I didn't know much about it but I vaguely recalled the premise of the Brad Pitt-Angelina Jolie movie, providing a sense of what to expect. Coincidentally, this was the second time in a row I encountered the idea that federal government agencies avoid hiring those with antisocial tendencies, having just watched ""To Catch a Killer"" before diving into this binge.Honestly, it surpassed my expectations, I was on the fence. Loved the casting, it has a really respectable supporting cast, lots of cameos. Donald Glover and Maya Erskine's exceptional chemistry, coupled with well-crafted writing, made each episode engaging with excellent tension and pacing. Every episode is invigorating. The runtime felt perfect, delivering good action and remarkable humor. The authenticity of the characters, driven by natural chemistry, often made me forget they were spies, when the show sometimes focused on their banter and marital dynamics.Pretty good binge. The last episode is a little weird and inebriated, it was basically the characters went on a psychedelic trip. I have to rewatch the movie, but my thoughts afterwards is that this is nearly perfect and probably better than the original movie. After the first two episodes, I completely forgot this was based on another movie. The premise seems ripe for spin-offs or an anthology series, given the versatile nature of the characters - anyone can be a ""smith"" without a defining trait. Highly recommended.",IMDB,Pretty good,8.0
"It was a fantastic show about a couple, who are spies, with new identities, and everything. And the show has something special when it comes to, you know, a certain feeling. And the feeling, the theme of the show is different. It's mysterious, yet very human. How they interact, how they feel about each other, and such, but at the same time how little they feel about the people they kill. So I would definitely say it's a really, really good show. A really good show, a good story. And you get to see the character's development. How the relationship progresses. And what ups and downs they encounter. Everything is so well-planned, I believe. I think that Donald Glover has a good mind when it comes to the story. And that he writes stories together with the other writers. And you know, the performances, acting, are top-notch. My only question mark is when it comes to the physical aspect of the show, when it comes to the fighting and actionsequences, it could be better. But when it comes to the story and everything else, it's really good. I don't understand why the rating is so low. Because it deserves much more. Everyone should definitely whatch it, and it definitely deserves a second season!",IMDB,What is it?,8.0
"I thought this was a brilliant and engrossing creation. The structure was smart, dialogue was strong and chemistry between Maya and Donald incredible. Also just the perfect balance between art and escapist entertainment (globe trotting from NYC to the Dolomites, beautiful sets/wardrobe and witty banter etc). It's a modern spy thriller that doesn't go so far as to parody the genre, but it's self aware enough to poke fun at itself. The amateur spy craft was distracting at first (why are they blatantly staring at their surveillance target!) but also makes them more accessible as two characters we might be able to relate to, who fell short in their attempts at joining top agencies.Would highly recommend.",IMDB,Brilliant and entertaining - highly recommend,10.0
"Mr. And Mrs. Smith is the most boring thing I've seen in recent memory. Nothing happens. I mean that literally - nothing happens. The dialog is the most simplistic of small talk. The leads Donald Glover and Maya Erskine as actors are dry as day-old toast, and have as much chemistry as oil and water. They are boring to watch, boring to hear, and just slog along from scene to scene with the hope that something interesting might happen.Unlike its excellent namesake film Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) the setup is slightly different here. In the film, the two Smith's were both assassins working for different agencies, and although legitimately married, had no knowledge of the other's true vocation. Here, the Smith's are recruited because they are losers in life and have nothing to lose, and put together in a luxurious house and given ""missions"" which aren't explained (not even to them) and hence we don't care about. They only pose as a married couple because reasons.Honestly, watching iron rust, grass grow, or paint flake would be preferable to this slogging, unimaginative rot.Hard pass.

"This show is so good. The writing, the production, and the acting is all fantastic. It's smart and funny and dark and light all at the same time. Very contemporary modern spy romance. Donald Glover, Stephen Glover, the Atlanta writers and producers, and Hiro Murai are the absolute best. They nail the tone so well. Maya Erskine was perfect for the role. Her performance is beyond excellent especially for her character and what eventually you learn about her. The only shows that match this level of finesse and integrity are Barry and Atlanta.

It set a really wrong expectation for me. There was no mystery, there was no tease, there was no chemistry and absolutely no cheesy cringe moments between the characters.

The characters become so endearing and likable over time. Can't help but root for them. Episode 4 was awesome! This show has some seriously talented writers! I laughed so hard listening to the conversation the couple had in bed at the end of the 4th episode. Somehow it was so relatable. There is action, but the show is more about a unique take on the original concept, developing characters, relationships and thoughtful, interesting dialogue. It's intelligent. So many surprising guest stars show up in this. I really hope that there will be a season 2.",IMDB,Love this!,10.0

They have zero charisma and are one demensional just like the storyline.The show starts off with two characters that, in just the 5 minutes on screen, showed more potential than the two you're watching for the rest of the episode.

The writing in this show is spectacular. Their adventures are fun but the dialogue between John and Jane is where this show hits a home run for me. It's realistic and raw and the cast executes with such a fantastic quality I couldn't look away. I highly recommend this show and watch the nuance between Donald and Maya. It's absolutely enthralling. The guest stars definitely add to the comedy and hijinks of the show. John Turturro and Sarah Paulson were my faves of the season.

Once the cat died at the start of the final episode I shut it off. I should have shut it off after the first five minutes of the first episode. A total vanity project and a complete misfire. Both actors should hang their heads in shame for starring in this atrocity. Poor pacing, god awful writing, subpar acting. Whoever green lit this should be fired.

"I wouldn't call it a comedy but it was witty, and fun. It's most serious but nearly every episode made me chuckle from some witty phrasing or situational humor. The characters are complex and interesting. You don't always like how they act but in a human way. My only criticism is the first couple ep have some dry patches.Despite their flaws they really grow on you. I really grew attached to the characters and kept coming back to see how they evolved. The action and scenes were done well. The ending was great, it had me on the edge of my seat the final episode. It was a really satisfying end to the characters, but I would love a season 2.

"This is not a remake of the Brad & Angelina hi octane Hollywood movie. However, the proposition is the same, John and Jane Smith brought together by some mysterious corporate entity to undertake high-risk clandestine missions around the world, while funded to live a lifestyle of relative luxury as their cover.Instead of a standard delivery of bangs, bullets and booms, what we have is a clever and witty examination of how our John and Jane interact and evolve, while still undertaking their perilous missions. So in essence the bangs, bullets and booms are still there, but interspersed with a well written and humorous examination of what it is to be a couple, albeit a couple whose jobs are assassination and espionage. And so to some of us that may sound a bit dull, but it isn't. It's really enjoyable, wel, paced series, made refreshing by the lack of endless chase scenes.Some episodes start, and you may think you're watching a purely human interest, drama, but the action is there, used in a more lite-touch way compared to what we might be used to. While other episodes it is more overt, a the central pillar to the story.Donald Glover and Maya Erskine do a great job as our Mr and Mrs Smith, and the locations take us from the Italian Dolomites, to Lake Como, Central American jungles to New York. I'm nine episodes into this 10 episode series, so I'm not quite sure how it ends but I sincerely hope they make a second season as entertaining as this one.",IMDB,"Witty, clever and better than Brad and Angelina.",9.0
"I find it strange that a lot of the reviews say the pacing, the script and the dialogues are bad, I really disagree with that. The aspect that I found the most touching, is how real and personal the dialogues are. The farting scene was what made their relationship become 'real' to the audience -when you start talk about farting, that is when you start to feel truly comfortable with your partner. I also loved the truth serum scene, where it emulates how people take psychedelics for therapy to be truthful and empathetic to one and other. The titles of each episodes represent different stages of a relationship: first date, double date, do you want to have kids etc. This couple full of chemistry is really a pleasure to watch on screen.",IMDB,Loved the dialogues,9.0
"The dull talky script says nothing. It crawls along like a wounded beast. It's only rescued by the fine acting of Maya Erskine, leaving boring scriptwriter and star Glover to talk s-l-o-w-l-y with big boring gaps between his inane utterances. It doesn't help that the sound design is almost silent for background sounds, making each dull bit of dialog just sit there. Yes, it does pick up after awhile but by the time it does, who cares?If you have an IQ under 100, this may work for you. This flick is pedestrian to the point of boredom. Only Erskine gives it life. Unfortunately, Glover's slow motion delivery results in the viewer nodding off for most of this lethargic exercise in bad - no worse, BORING - scriptwriting. It's about an actor's ego getting in the way of art. Avarice is a slow motion killer of art. Glover needs to his priorities straight.",IMDB,Somnambulant ego trip by Donald Glover,4.0

In a good way though- it makes you reflect which I appreciate.The true gold of this series is the relational arc and nuance they managed to capture and show so brilliantly. This is truly the struggle for most people whether they know it or not. I love how they subtly (and also at times outright) portrayed so many of the specific issues that come up between men and women (and between masculine and feminine archetypes) and subtly but also in a straightforward way really identified some underlying factors that show up often for a lot of people.I absolutely LOVED this and thought it was genius how they put it all together.

It's important to build the story.Anyway, we binged it. We laughed, we were on the edge of our seats at some points. Acting was great.

"Mr and Mrs Smith is a Prime Video series that reimagines the 2005 movie of the same name, starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as a married couple who are secretly spies for rival agencies. In this version, created by Donald Glover and Francesca Sloane, the titular characters are played by Glover and Maya Erskine, who are not married but posing as a couple for a mysterious organization that assigns them dangerous missions.The series is a delightful mix of action, comedy, and romance, with a dash of existential angst. Glover and Erskine have a natural and effortless chemistry, which makes their relationship believable and compelling. They are also hilarious, delivering witty and sarcastic lines with perfect timing and expression. The show does not shy away from the awkward and messy aspects of their situation, such as the fart scene in episode 3, or the existential crisis in episode 6. These moments add depth and realism to their characters, and make them more relatable and sympathetic.The show also boasts an impressive lineup of guest stars, who add flavor and variety to the episodes. John Turturro, Paul Dano, Sarah Paulson, Parker Posey, Wagner Moura, Michaela Coel, Alexander Skarsgård, and Eiza González are some of the notable names who appear as allies, enemies, or bystanders in the Smiths' adventures. Each guest star brings their own charm and charisma to their role, and some of them have surprising twists and turns that keep the viewers on their toes.The action scenes are well-choreographed and executed, with a touch of humor and absurdity. The show does not take itself too seriously, and often pokes fun at the spy genre tropes and clichés. The missions are varied and creative, ranging from infiltrating a cult to stealing a priceless painting to rescuing a kidnapped panda. The show also explores the moral and ethical dilemmas that the Smiths face as spies, such as the consequences of their actions, the loyalty to their employer, and the trust between each other.Mr and Mrs Smith is a rare reboot that surpasses its source material, thanks to its clever, thoughtful writing, its charming, talented leads, and its stellar supporting cast. It is a show that balances action, comedy, and romance, and delivers a satisfying and entertaining experience. It is a show that makes the universe feel a little better.",IMDB,Awesome,8.0

I feel kind of sad about how things turned out, but at the same time, I'm aware that's where it's all headed; so I'm not really sure what I'm writing here about, maybe I'm just rooting for it to end differently.I don't know, it just feels like this adds up to the long list of narratives where people should not hope for a pleasant ending, because in ""real life,"" probably there isn't one, and it's disappointing.Anyways, I had fun; it's not hard to watch; the vibe's there, and that's what matters, I guess.",IMDB,It's a fun watch,8.0

"This generation frustrates me; it produces constant trash. Cinema quality seems to have peaked, with people criticizing shows instead of addressing the real issue-lack of attention. Actors and directors work hard, entertaining an audience with the attention span of a 10-second TikTok video. To be liked, a show must resemble a 10-second movie, satisfying short-term memory. The best shows start slow, but our audience demands instant gratification.

"I went into this show not knowing what to expect. Only that I was a fan of Atlanta and all its weird, jarring, sharp, and often hilarious writing. Donald Glover has such an eye for human behavior and it shows in his work over and over again. I did not expect Brad Pitt to show up, despite his movie sharing the same name.This is a show about relationships. It does a deep, sincere dive into two people rushing into one. The spy element is secondary and frames the entire development of John and Jane's time together. Do not expect a shallow action series. Do not expect to see every mission together. Do not expect to have your hand held throughout the show.Do expect to watch two people fumble through a relationship under the insane constraints being a spy would produce. Do make assumptions about their time in between missions, based on the world and information the show has provided for you.To give you one idea how the show manages what it does - in one episode John and Jane are managing an older, belligerent target they have to secure in much the same way they would a young child. John suddenly reflects the dismissive and short father the entire episode while Jane grows soft and attends. It provides a perfectly unique lens with which to view a moment in time for many couples with all the trappings of a spy thriller.It wouldn't work as well as it does if not for the unbelievable performances by Donald Glover as John and Maya Erskine as Jane, who are phenomenal and very real characters to me by the end. The script allows lines that feel so authentically, organically human - it's pure joy to watch.I hated for it to come to an end. I want more of this world, more of John and Jane. More of his mother.

"This show is 90% talk and 10% doing, meaning the characters just talk and do nothing else other than talk for most of the show; after patiently listening to the boy and girl flirt and say clever things to each other for 19 minutes something finally happens, they get up and go somewhere, whoo hoo!. But when they get there they end up talking and talking and talking. Sure they say some clever and sometimes humorous things but its mainly boring talk designed to take up time. One mission was to make contact with a Chinese woman in a restaurant. They went to the restaurant and got a table where they could see the target then they proceeded to talk and talk and talk and talk until the target finally left so they had to chase down the target on a painfully lame, boring and idiotic chase scene, absolutely no fun at all, it was anti-fun. I end up fast forwarding through most of it to get to the parts that are slightly interesting.

"I was looking for a slick, fun, action-packed show to enjoy, and I thought this would be it. It's emphatically not. This is, instead, just a terrible chore. Just to set things straight from the off: I have absolutely NO interest in the film, which I saw years ago on TV and instantly dismissed and forgot, so I'm not even beginning to compare.After a cracking opening scene, this settles into a pattern of two ill-matched characters, played by bland actors with all the chemistry of two damp and mis-matched socks, mumbling, meandering and bickering all over the place. There is an endless conversation, early on, about what to call the cat, which will serve as a warning, as that slack, flaccid tone permeates this series. There is no tension, nothing of the intrigue and suspense that you'd think would come of two people having to live a cover story in the heart of New York City while serving as hunting/killing/espionage agents for an unseen department. They swan around their luxury brownstone with the rooftop garden, or in exotic locations, sticking out a mile. He smirks, she sulks, they bicker about family, kids, gender roles and bodily functions. Occasionally something happens. Just when you think it can't get any worse, they act as stupidly as possible (honestly, episode 4 is a head slapper, where they are as indiscrete as two people could possibly be, while episode 5 has them committing major errors of judgement that a rookie uniformed cop wouldn't make).

"If you're coming into this expecting it to be like the 2005 movie, you'll be surprised, possibly positively so.Similarities are contained to the base of a spy-themed action comedy about a married couple. But this is notably less carefree lighthearted fun, more grounded, serious with relatively sparse action, and comedy that verges more towards the dark.But mainly, it has a notable relationship dramedy core. It kind of uses the shell of the JolPitt movie as a Trojan horse to do something different, its own, more distinct and interesting.It's deliberately paced, takes its time, which may not be to everyone's taste as this at times perhaps can make it feel somewhat lethargic to some, but also gives it a pleasantly sedate vibe, time to breathe and settle into a more calming flow and allows it to expand on minute details, which gives it a distinct feel and personality I think.Something that feels like it would absolutely not work at all without the two leads and their chemistry. Glover and Erskine are both great and work well together, providing an emotional and comedic core that pretty much drives the whole show.",IMDB,"Not what I expected, and more interesting for it.",8.0

"Mr & Mrs Smith (2024) is NOT the same as the (2005) film, and that's what makes it great! Sure, it's the same name and a tale of two spies in a struggling marriage but that is where the similarities end. This series takes the themes of the film (marriage, communication, identity, compromise) and dives in further. John and Jane aren't just two spies; they come with baggage and the series does a great job portraying what it is like to sort it out with your partner. Anyone who has been in a long-standing relationship knows that success comes from duking it out, throwing your insecurities out in the open, and gluing it all back together again with love. This series shows that process with the added flare of sleek espionage, high-energy combat, beautiful film locations, and, my god, I loved looking at every well-decorated house that showed up on the screen. The soundtrack is wonderful (I expect no less from Donald Glover) and the main theme slides just like James Bond's. The main actors, Donald Glover and Maya Erskine complement each other and bring out the best portrayal of marriage I have seen on screen in a long time. With the bonus of some personal favorites such as Sarah Paulson and Parker Posey, I just felt like this series kept giving more and more to draw me in. Overall, give this series a chance. It is such a fun watch that is visually appealing and sucks you in with phenomenal acting. Brad and Angelina had their movie, but this series is its own entity.

"From the inception of the trailers in late 2023, followed by the backlash it unfairly received, I knew it was something I had to see for myself and it nailed it. Donald Glover absolutely destroys this role. He's certainly the shining beacon carrying the show. That's not to say that Maya Erskine didn't perform, because she pulled up and carried her weight as well. The chemistry between the two is top notch and believable. The spy genre in film has become stale over the years with obvious tropes and unrealistic scenarios. This show grounds it in reality in a way that is interesting and believable. Many will try to compare it to the Brad Pitt film (which is also not the original rendition) and pass it off as a diversity bait media. However, it absolutely stands on its own with a captivating story, characters and action.",IMDB,Epic Spy Thriller that keeps the genre fresh,10.0
"I love the direction this show takes because it avoids the cartoon shoot em up style of the movie altogether. Instead we get real people with real issues in a mostly realistic setting that normal people can relate to. The leads have plenty of chemistry and we see how two strangers in an awkward situation eventually grow together and fall in love. The situations they find themselves in are over the top and fantastic but presented in such a way that it never feels faked or forced. It was entertaining from start to finish and I can't wait to see more.The only negative I have is that maybe eight episodes weren't enough. I feel like they went from rookie agents to 007 level too quickly. Still, it was a great ride that leaves us hanging and hoping for a swift return.",IMDB,Excellent take on the subject matter,9.0
"I really enjoyed this, just finished binge watching last night.... So it was good enough to grab my attention.The two main characters are both flawed but, very lovable in their own way. Without giving too much away, they are both rejects from their background jobs and decide to recruit to take on high risk espionage roles. The two are coupled together, given a home and are meant to me husband and wife... Hence the title.Ok, there's lots of flaws and the writing isn't perfect as they seem to go from low risk to incredibly high risk in a short amount of time.... But that isn't the point, it's the bits in between that make the show so lovable.I hope there's a second season... Its kind of been left that way.",IMDB,Great fun,10.0
"I thought this was going to be an action-packed remake of the movie, in longer format...and I was hesitant to watch it. While I enjoyed the movie bc of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were in it...it was not a big hit. But when I finally had time to watch the show, I was pleasantly surprised...and instantly hooked. This shows the premise of the movie from the beginning: how 2 strangers are thrust together, and must make a false marriage work while completing very difficult missions. We are informed at the outset what will happen if these missions are failed, which makes the stakes dire in every episode. The suspense is always present, even in funny moments, bc we know what could happen. And while parts may seem like it could be from a romcom, the consequences are much more severe. I recommend this show to anyone who likes great story, realistic action, and suspense.",IMDB,Much more realistic Mr. & Mrs. Smith,10.0
"Somehow I accidentally started watching 8th episode of the show instead of the 1st, but... If finale was that boring, I doubt anything else before it was good.I mean, the 2005 movie did not inspire me at all either, and I also found it quite boring, but it had at least some... Pacing? It felt like it was, at least, trying to be a spy movie. This one - did not even try. One can say, that maybe they wanted a more ""grounded"" approach, something more realistic. That is fine, but not if it's mundane.Let's be honest, we all know why we like spy shows - high-octane action packed with smarts and wrapped in style. And intrigue, of course, we can't forget that. One would expect finale of such a show to be as exciting as it can get, but it was not. There was more talking than action, and the little pieces of action were uninspiring.Definitely, do not waste you time on this one.",IMDB,Buah,1.0
"To begin with, this is another show that takes a reknown one and does something completely different, like with Kung Fu. In this case, nothing related with Brad and Angelina except for the words spy and coupleThey better could have call it The Smiths to avoid comparisonsSecond, this is not a romantic comedy of spies like Night and Day nor a Jason Bourne sequel.This is a show about the stages or evolution of a typical heterosexual couple with the excuse of being paired by a mysterious company and having to complete missions, which are an excuse to reflect on the forementioned stages in a satiric and cool way that I found smart and well written.As I said, the characters are not Jason Bourne: They make many mistakes, like any mortal. It is difficult to point while you are being shot. Running on snow is almost impossible. Sometimes you forget to charge your phone when leaving home. Etc. I think that showing them as imperfect is what someone called good espionage show, but I don't think so. To me, The Americans is a superb espionage show, this one not, but making the characters clumsy and failing was necessary to keep the human lens on themMr. & Ms. Smith is simply about a boy that met a girl at work that will remind you of many discussions and conflicts but also promises and complicity lived with your couple and watched in other couples, especially if you have been for many yearsHighly recommended if you know what you are going to watch and accept the slow pace.",IMDB,Not what you expect and no relation with the movie,8.0
"I think it's time that we agree that we all have different perspectives! As for me I saw myself in the characters! I saw my relationships and I also believed the characters were real and I was spying on their life! Am grateful for this experience!Certainly! The storytelling captivated me from the beginning, weaving a narrative that mirrored aspects of my own life and relationships. The characters felt authentic, as if I were glimpsing into their real lives. The gratitude I feel for this immersive experience is a testament to the show's ability to resonate on a deeply personal level. Each episode unfolded like a window into relatable moments, making it a truly enriching and reflective journey.Donald Glover and Francesca Sloan's creative brilliance shines through in his infusion of surreal moments in every episode. Whether it's through dreamlike sequences or unexpected twists, Glover adds a layer of intrigue and unpredictability to his work. This surreal touch not only keeps viewers on their toes but also adds a unique and thought-provoking dimension to the storytelling. It's a testament to his artistic vision and willingness to push creative boundaries, making each episode a captivating exploration of both reality and imagination.",IMDB,Many people are angry but please don't cancel,10.0
"Soon as this was announced with Donald Glover's name attached I thought hmmm this just might be interesting, then the first trailer hit and my interest was peaked. The original Film was fun with great actors and lots of entertainment but far from realistic... everything this series is not. Think of this series is as Mr. And Mrs Smith with a hint of Black Mirror, it will subvert all your expectations because it ask the questions that the film would never. It's a dark action comedy that at times has serious suspense that I honestly couldn't see coming, and that's the beauty of it. Also the world building done in this first season could lead to so much more and I hope we see more of this World. The music, style, cinematography, and ""pulp fiction"" type conversations together made this viewing stand out from most spy dramas.

"One of the most boring, annoying, long-drawn-out TV shows I've ever seen. The whole season could have been resolved with a 90 minutes ""B"" series movie. The nagging and whispering voices of the two main characters definitely are a big minus. The last episode is a masterpiece of modern useless lingering repetition of the same crap that it will probably win some kind of award. They spent so much money going around the world shooting this slow paced and repetitive show that it is impressive. I fully understand that Amazon has to produce something to show to us clients, but this is definitely not something worth watching. Absolutely NOT recommended.",IMDB,"Bad, very very bad!",1.0
"Mr. And Mrs. Smith delivers. Smarter than the average action-based show, M&MS manages to have it both ways: exciting gun play and chases, satisfying character development and genre winks. That Glover is exceptionally talented and charismatic will surprise no one who has been paying attention. Maya Erskine is a revelation, with a nuanced performance and dynamic physicality. The series manages to balance the action and the relationship. The bar is set high, yet the hiccoughs are few and far between.High caliber guest stars add to the fun, with the always spot-on Sarah Paulson shining in the role of marriage counselor. Some of the action scenes riff on the ""impossible odds"" scenarios of Bond films, where the shots fired to landed ratio hovers at around 200-1. The truth serum bit of the wrap-up, set up with gusto by John Turturro in episode 2, may be a touch pat, but the leads carry it off with aplomb.Will there be more? The close strikes a mysterious balance that soon left me questioning my initial certainty about the fate of M&MS. If a second season happens I will be on board with the killer couple and their new cat. Hats off to the stars, the direction, the sets (Great Whale, indeed), and (most of) the writing. Highly recommended.",IMDB,The Goods,8.0
"Oof - what a swing and a miss in so many areas. First off - I think the Writers missed a chance to lock into some Spicy Independent Diverse Spies and ended up with a modern day blah fest of some horribly average (hard to believe) spy characters. With a heavy dose of Codependency and wayyyy overdone attempts at ""humanising"" said spies (at least I think that was the goal). Anyhoo - my point is that the energy these characters give off is NOT super successful spies. More like newbie spies who accidentally don't get themselves killed from mediocrity on all levels of job commitments.I just couldn't find a way to respect these characters as bad a*s spies. I do think the actors are quite capable of more. So the issue is somewhere behind the scenes.I did make it all the way through - but it rapidly became a ""background noise"" show as I did other things. And I did not miss much for doing so.",IMDB,I Like My Spice with SOME Spice,3.0
"I know it is still early in the year, but I anticipate that Mr. And Mrs. Smith will rank among my top five series. When I started watching, I didn't know what to expect, but by the end, I experienced a wide range of emotions. Glover and Erskin had excellent chemistry and complement each other well. Their portrayal of a blossoming and disintegrating relationship kept me on my toes. Initially, they display an awkward tension, which transitions into a harmonious and successful relationship before ultimately falling apart. The authenticity of their relationship's progression gave me anxiety in the best way possible.Although, while some have questioned the significance and purpose of THIS Mr and Mrs Smith, it's refreshing how the reboot serves as a commentary on the dynamics of marriage and relationships in general. The use of spy missions and dark humor as narrative devices effectively conveys this message. In contrast, the 2005 film was merely a fun, albeit campy, blockbuster. The reboot, however, is not a direct remake; it offers significantly more depth, which is precisely what gives it value.",IMDB,Unexpected Surprise,10.0

"Respectfully to those of you who have left a low review, take a breath.I'll be honest, the reason I watched this show was because of Donald. However, the reason I stayed was because this show blew my socks off. There is nothing else on streaming that is even remotely similar.Spy movies/shows just aren't my thing so I wasn't expecting to like it. I was just supporting a creator that I admire. I was completely taken aback by the fact that it gripped me from the first scene. Now having finished the show I love that the beginning scene paralleled the ending scene. I wasn't expecting that and I think it was poetic.I most enjoyed getting to watch our Jane and John grow. The shy beginning growing into a tight connection and then slowly fading to them growing apart to only in the end, reunite organically. Their growth felt palpable, I felt like I was watching a real life couple who are trying to navigate lives, careers, and love. I think that was the point, Mr & Mrs Smith ARE just real people chosen from the masses. Real people with emotions and problems. Getting to see that in the high stakes setting of the spy world felt so immersive. When watching action tv/movies the action is the plot and character development is on the back burner. This show spun that on its head, it prioritized the viewers connection to the characters to establish an emotional link (while still showing unique and gripping action) which immersed the viewer in their world. When they hurt we hurt. They felt like us.We watched Jane and John grow, succeed, fail & fall in love. This wasnt just a journey for them, it was a journey for us, the viewer. This show was art. This show and these characters felt real. I hope to see a season 2.",IMDB,"You're overly critical, take a breath",10.0
"This series is incredibly misleading. Bait and switch on minute number six of the pilot.I'm not sure who the audience is for this. After a absolutely terrible introduction to a shootout where a man and woman who are prepared for it, show us that they are actually unprepared and having gun and shells in weird places, like the bathroom medicine cabinet? Yet they have a motion sensor that goes off and alerts them. Then the male dies by an obvious sniper and is not the person in the approaching car. The female forgets this altogether and goes completely commando and targets the car, forgetting the sniper that took out her mate.Then we jump into interview sessions with the replacement team as they answer questions from a computer. Seriously lame at all costs with questions like ""how much is in your checking account?"" and ""Have you ever said I love you?"" WTF is this? Black Mirror wannabe?Then we get to the awkwardness of meeting and working with someone new, and instead of chatting and getting to know someone like everyone else, they separate immediately and go to sleep. Weird. Then their first stakeout they continuously stare at the mark. It gets annoying how bad these two are at any kind of spy work and we spin off 10 minutes in the pilot episode following/observing and then run into a hurdle and we have to stop to exchange numbers. Who actually writes this stuff?Then they split up and we get a one sided conversation through and ear piece and text messages. Incredibly lame when this guy is just is continually chatting in her ear. Then we get a great example of amateur hour by running away from an explosion. Nothing like that to draw attention to oneself. Spycraft 101 is wearing useable shoes, loafers and heeled boots are definitely both out. This is a lesson on what not to do.With such a great premise to build on with the success of the original movie and there are so many easy ways to make this a success. Yet we are shown two characters bumbling around like teenagers on their first date.At the end we are shown that one of the creators/writers is Donald Glover. Yeesh dude, how can you write yourself as a complete incompetent, yet also put in that you know that some pistol has a counterbalance in it?I decided to push my way through and watch Episode 2 as it can't get any worse. John Turturro must have needed a mortgage payment to sign up for this. He is just used terribly. In order to get him alone our strategy is to pay a waiter to do anything we want to him??? What??? This is the writing? And then then both are on the floor barking like dogs.This is the writing of this series. Then he starts spouting off stuff as he's injected with a truth serum, as these two are able to get the billionaire into a waiting car and take home. Then he dies and of course he has no friends or family.

Big studios, and Amazon MGM is now one of them, have to produce to survive - and throughout the history of Hollywood there are incomparably more bad movies than the good ones, but still I'm pretty sure Amazon would benefit from making less bad shows, and concentrate on trying to find a good one...",IMDB,Unwatchable,2.0
"This show never claimed to be the 2005 Film. This is an orginal and layered take on an otherwise waning genre that can easily grow stale.

This is a show for actual grown ups, it's not a sex crazed up fever dream. Boring is the the last thing I'd use to describe this show. It may not be the most fast paced show, yet it doesn't need to be. Most reviews seem as if the full season wasn't even watched. One, or even half the show is not sufficient.

"To me - and I'm sure a lot of other people - it's an engaging show. There's a lot of relatable pieces of dialogue and plot points that parallel with being in a relationship, and even some references to what's it like being a parent. I can imagine that might go over some people's head and it might not be funny or engaging because their experiences being in relationships and looking after kids are different enough that they can't relate to anything depicted in the show. This is probably Mr & Mrs Smith's weakest point. It does heavily rely on the viewer to relate somehow to what their relationship endures as the story's main focus is on their sometimes tumultuous relationship.I definitely recommend giving this show a go, but definitely temper your expectations if you're not a fan of underhanded comedy (ala The Bear) or ""modern"" love stories.",IMDB,I can understands the hate...but I love it!,8.0
"I had to leave a review to stave off the low ratings and reviews. It seems like all any of those viewers wanted to do was compare this to the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie film but it can't even be compared to the film... It's entirely different and better for it. The writing, directing, and cinematography are elevated. Donald Glover and Maya Erskine bring their own chemistry and charm into the roles. The way we're able to glimpse into stages of their relationship with each episode was unexpected and leaves you wanting more. The series takes its time in building out John and Jane's relationship and this pays off in that you're really rooting for these two to be okay in the end and be able to live out their lives together.

Sure, some of the camera movements are perfect, framing is perfect...but more than that, what hits you is how the city looks like a city. There's no impossibly steady drone shots from above, there's actually a ton of people moving along on the streets, in shops, in the background.

"The latest in a series of movies with the same title and vaguely similar story line (the 1941 version staring Carol Lombard and directed by Alfred Hitchcock remains best of breed). This time it's about a pair of psychopathic assassins for hire looking to boost their resumes and incomes, bought and brought together by a mysterious global organization (as always!), and using a fabricated marriage (and, of course, fake IDs) as cover. There is humor, romance, surprises, suspense, and a number of action set pieces (see below). There is also a very dangerous love/hate relationship. All of this is weighed down by the script and dialog deliveries. The movie is poorly written and punctuated with unexplained and hard-to-fathom events starting with the opening scenes in the first episode (which remain unexplained until the closing scenes of the last episode--if the viewer still cares). The usual Smith-to-Smith dialog is Reality TV quality. It seems often ad libbed, small-talk like, tedious, and far from interesting. This works against establishing chemistry between the protagonists that can be observed by the viewer. It doesn't help when the Smith characters frequently mumble their lines in English. The movie has been dubbed into many languages including Japanese. The leading Japanese voice actors, for example, clearly speak their lines with the leading voice actress providing a far more engaging (and understandable) line readings than actress Maya Erskine (Mrs. Smith) speaking English. Attempted low-comedy falls flat. Leading players are a mixed bag. Actor Donald Glover (Mr. Smith) has an infectious style of delivery especially in the early episodes. Erskine's performance seems to be a work in progress as she struggles to escaped being steamrolled by Glover's acting. She also appears to be physically mismatched to the part. The show is rather short (there are only eight episodes), but production appears to be lavish and it looks like most of the budget can be seen on screen. Action scenes are especially well directed/edited (and choreographed). The viewer will be tempted to fast-forward through the dribble in between. English subtitles can not be divorced from CC/SDH which is a constant irritation during the first six episodes. In the last two episodes, English subtitles appear to be normal, but foreign language versions can not be brought up. Below average popcorn movie. Viewed on Amazon Prime.

"I suspect the reason the series hasn't a higher rating is because a lot of people expected a similar plot and style to the movie. This is very different and it's likely those wanting relentless action tuned out early on and rated it poorly. For those willing to try something much deeper, then this series is a brilliant character study and genuinely clever and funny at the same time. The leads are superb, with Maya Erskine an absolute revelation. There's natural chemistry and you get hooked into their crazy lives and relationships very naturally. Okay so a couple of the early episodes are a bit slow but patience is a virtue and the investment of a few hours is really worth it. Production is excellent with some really great sets, both interiors and exterior. I'd highly recommend this for anyone who likes their shows operating on a few levels!",IMDB,A slow burn but definitely worth it...,8.0
"I personally liked the show and the movie for different reasons. The movie was sexy and fun. The show was more relatable and gave more insight on The Smith spies. I found these Smiths to be more relatable and likeable characters. Though the Angelina Jolie / Brad Pitt movie will always hold a special place in my heart, I feel like the show as a whole showed better character development than the movie. This couple randomly found love and just wanted to financially make ends meet like anyone else but with a dangerous twist. It makes you think almost anyone with some type of battle experience could take on the job. There were some humorous moments but i wouldn't exactly call this a heavy comedy. If you're going into this expecting the same amount of exaggerated acting that you saw in the movie, you will be very disappointed.",IMDB,Movie vs the Show,9.0
"I quite like the genuine storytelling style of Donald Glover and Hiro Murai tandem since their viral music video ""This is America.""
Here Francesca Sloane takes the position of her showrunner's debut, which makes sense since she has been writing since the brilliant if sometimes presumptuous ""Atlanta"", which despite a few episodes as a glimpse is very fresh and genuine, different from its competition at least (I won't talk bout ""Swarm"" because it is the worst stop in terms of pretentiousness and script, in my opinion, completely failed and surprisingly childish at times).The tv show is based on the 20yrs old film with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie (they were also a real couple and were both golden spotlights in Hollywood's ecosystem at that time). I think that did a lot in marketing and had a clear impact on its million-dollar box office. But let's be honest, it was and it is a mediocre movie if it weren't for its superstar protagonists playing the double game as a fictional/real couple.The paradigm shift here is clear and much appreciated, everything feels way more ""modern"" and updated as should be. The dialogues felt more organic and of course the character construction was pretty great. The chemistry between Glover and Erskine is undoubted. Overall it's a pretty fun series to binge, whose reflection on romance and relationships is very much in line with mine, probably because everyone on the team is the same age as me and I can see the seams, for better and for worse. And that is the double-edged sword of Sloane's proposal and Glover's trusted squad. What could be a really fun and smart action comedy sometimes wanted to be unnecessarily serious. Raising conflicts and debates that lead to more drama which wasn't needed. The plot is obviously completely surreal and consciously distances itself from a ""serious"" spy series (f.e. The excellent ""The Americans""). Starting from this basis, these serious moments for which they decide to experiment (especially the last chapters) for me failed miserably. The beginning felt great, and in my opinion they should have settled for the execution of an easy-to-watch series, a brilliant cast full of high-end cameos that only aims to entertain and laugh even to itself. However, at the end it leaves you with a bittersweet taste, confirming that it is a not quite convincing hybrid of genres that does not reach the level of ""Killing Eve"", which makes its intentions clear from the beginning to the end: simply quality entertainment with good black humor underneath. Even so, I recommend viewing especially to Atlanta's fans, including myself (there are enough uncomfortable situations in a good way here that will be appreciated by)",IMDB,Good enterteining but wants to be a little more... and don't quite succeed,8.0
"First of all .... this TV show shared nothing in common with the movie, which shares the same name, and who's characters they kill off in the first 10s of the TV show for no reason.Everyone says to judge this on it's own merit... yet they name it the same thing as the movie.... and have the same characters from the movie..... which again, they just pointlessly murder in the opening 10s.... and after that this TV show has absolutely nothing in common with it.Nothing about this is believable (not that the movie was supposed to be ""believable"") and everything is just dumb. The movie was an action / romance / comedy. This show has no action, there is no romance, it isn't funny, and the acting is flat.I hate that every show these days attempts to do the ""awkward humor"" ..... ""omg it's so awkward and they've added quirky music"" and we're supposed to think that's hilarious. This is completely tone deaf to the original movie. They should have just made their own original terrible tv show without ruining the movie by instantly killing characters we ACTUALLY liked.If this was an original show, unrelated to the movie, I don't see how people could give this anything more than 3 or MAYBE a 4 ..... but killing the characters we liked only to replace them with this .... and try making money by stealing the name of the movie that has nothing to do with it ..... well that gets you a 1.Don't waste your time.",IMDB,Listen To The Terrible Reviews and Don't Waste Your Time,1.0
"Having never bothered with the eponymous previous-century Pitt-Jolie movie, I found this a very entertaining romp of a binge-watch. Having never seen PEN15, I found Maya Erskine to be a revelation as ""Jane."" She's obviously no Jolie-class beauty, but I don't care one whit about that in the context of what an superb comic actor she is. Her timing is impeccable and her facial expressions exude an oddball charm and are always dead-on appropriate situationally while frequently managing to somehow surprise me. Donald Glover as ""John"" is also excellent, but IMO this is Ms. Erskine's series, with her fellow lead generously giving her all the space her talent needs to shine -- and shine she certainly does!""Jane"" starts off rather hesitant and cautious, but her true and much more assertive nature gradually emerges as the series progresses. Glover's ""John"" seems like a typically confident ex-military macho man with top-notch combat skills, but his development goes in the other direction as he's revealed to also be an emotionally fragile young man -- and quite the ""mama's boy"" in contrast to the frequently cold, distant, and methodically violent ""Jane.""All in all I enjoyed this series very much and hope to see another season of their wild exploits and problematic relationship pitfalls. Together, Erskine and Glover create a compelling, alternately hilarious and heartbreaking portrayal of an essentially incompatible couple helplessly attracted to each while pursuing their absurdly violent and ethically dubious mutual occupation.",IMDB,A delightful spy-action/rom-com hybrid,8.0
"When I heard about the this franchise being rebooted it seemed like it would be interesting, but we all know how this story usually goes and plays out. Another Hollywood running out of ideas still, and lets try and milk this franchise for more money.When they reboot old franchises they're slower and worse off than the original. The 2005 movie was decent, but this show brings the franchise down. Donald Glover is better off as in his music career Childish Gambino still, while his acting is ok. Maya Erskine has always been mid, and in this show they both keep up with their usual trend. Save your time and skip.",IMDB,Seemed it would be interesting...,1.0
"This show is a lesson in why you should not let IMDB reviews sway you too much. I appreciate this is an oxymoron as I type this out. The initial reviews to this show were harsh and I don't understand why. It was very well written and the acting was realistic and sound. I really really enjoyed it. It was not repetitive and despite this being based on a movie, it was unpredictable in a unique way. I didn't feel as it I was watching a show version the movie and that's what makes this an effective piece of TV. It had that thing that Atlanta had....that Swarm had, the episodes peaked and spokesman with different dynamics but overall the show cascaded beautifully.Really looking forward to the next season.",IMDB,I made an account to review this!!!,8.0
"While I was pleased with the series, it stresses me to know they ended season one without closer. Life is full of drama stress and chaos but we hope good entertainment would allow us to escape reality even for a moment, complete with a closer, even if it is not always a happy ending. I'm don't believe I will be watching or recommending season 2 with new lead characters if they are not going to give viewers the satisfaction of a closer to what happens with the Donald Glover and Maya Erskine characters in season 1. I became so emotionally attached to to the actores, their characters, and the their experiences. That's my two cents. I hope it's worth more yo the writers, director and producers and they listen.",IMDB,Good Series. Great Acting. Disappointing Cliffhanger.,8.0
"From the pilot to the ending, the entire series is awesome. The way it ended definitely can't wait to see the second season.Kudos to the director! Might be the first time as a film critic that I've seen where you genuinely believe the MAIN characters might die. If not one then the other. This is more than edge of your seat suspense, more like let me check my Ring doorbell camera for intruders trying to come at me in real life. That's how exciting/horrifying this series is.The deaths are all realistic. No over dramatic blood scenes, one doesn't need to be shot 50 times to die. And the deaths could come at ANY point the tape is rolling.Danny and Maya played their roles very well. Good series.",IMDB,Intriguing watch,9.0
"And the ending is also bad. The idea may have work if it was better written as a story and dialogues. Direction overall of actors and scenes is wtf. I watched all 8 episodes to arrive at a frustrating conclusion,
The major issues was badly orchestrate fights , lame dialogues, main actors that dont feel charismatic , a plot that dosent work.Another female lead that is totally miscast and not nice. Even compressing the 8 episodes to a single movie wouldnt really help.The overall editing is not flowing well, many scenes are not well executed. Some scenes wt texting where unreadable when they can had made it easy. The Writers and producers totally should be ashamed of this misfire, Not recommended unless like me you will FFW a lot and still feel at the end this was one of the worst first season series in a long time.",IMDB,"Lame writing, too slow, bad everything.",4.0
"At first I was kind of turned off by the idea of a reimagining of the original movie, which wasn't overly amazing in my opinion but had extraordinary chemistry between Jane and John. Also the reviews on here put me off from watching the show any sooner. Anyways...A few elements of the movie are still present in this series, such as the witty dialogues and brilliant chemistry between all of the characters. The 8 episodes fly by in an instance and leave you wanting for more (even if the cliffhanger is rather annoying in my opinion).The series builds upon the movie instead of retconning everything or ignoring its existence. Everything that happened in the original may have happened but in the same time- maybe not. It honestly doesn't matter, as the concept stays the same. Except that both of them know from the start, that they're spies. And they're matched together. Tinder for spies I guess.I love the music, vibe, cinematography and overall story. Give it a chance and don't pay too much attention to all of these subpar reviews. I couldn't get them if I tried.",IMDB,Love is blind for spies,9.0
Right off the top this series has done itself a disservice for using the same name as a popular Brad Pitt movie. Immediately you think it's a series that has been rebooted so that it can be race swapped to satisfy the immediate attention seeking youth generation. Not to mention the lack of original content coming out of Hollywood that we have to recycle something from the past and barely put a new spin on it.The main actors are absolutely solid so there is that. Donald Glover has shown himself to be a real solid actor going from Community to Atlanta. Maya Erskine has also has a wide range of roles but I especially enjoyed watching her in Plus One.Unfortunately Donald and Maya cannot carry a dry and boring story line.,IMDB,Dry and Boring,3.0
"This is a very good ""dry"" comedy series, with Donald Glover's amazing talent on full display, superb support from the rest of the cast and some amazing guest stars, and fantastic action and romance elements.Although listed as ""Action-Comedy-Crime"" on IMDb, It should actually be listed as ""Action-Comedy-Romance,"" as it is equal parts all of those. If you're just expecting a spy-thriller, you'll be disappointed, but if you come in with the expectation that this is a twist on the classic rom-com, then you'll understand the tone that the series is going for. It is the relationship between John and Jane that takes precedence in the series, not the action elements.The action and spy elements are well done and provide a nice added dimension, but the real strength of this show is on the development between its leads and the way their relationship progresses under pressure. 8/10.",IMDB,Action-Comedy-Romance,8.0
Hated the movie with Pitt and Jolie...just a big zero. This series on the other hand is fantastic. Lots of depth in the relationship between the two lead characters and the development of their relationship. Excellent acting by the two leads. A totally binge worthy series. Couldn't stop watching. Great guest stars in each episode add to the appeal even more. Highly recommend this series to those who look to mature entertainment. Maya Erskine deserves an Emmy for this.People who don't like the series clearly just want vacuous shot em up fare with zero complexity. Empty violence is what they crave. This series isn't it.,IMDB,Awesome,10.0
"I'm someone who believes that somethings are need to be left alone and not be remade but this was a fresh breath of air! Donald Glover is truly a genius and a multidisciplinary artist. I started caring for the characters and their relationship on the second episode and was so invested in the storyline. The cinematography is amazing and I loved the Art pieces they used in the show which was symbolically and aesthetically pleasing! The Yin and Yang, the masculine and the feminine like the twin swans paintings on their apartment wall and I was obsessed with the first painting Jane bought.The last episode was really pulling on my emotional strings and made me ball my eyes out. Love is such a beautiful, strange, terrifying thing and this was such a poetic way of capturing it along with the complicated dynamics and dimensions that comes with relationships.",IMDB,IT'S WORTH A BINGE,10.0
"If woody Allen did an action movie this wouid be it. This was hard to get through. The ONLY redeeming quality was the action. The rest was woddys overthinking relationship babble. Could t make it through the entire season. I think I made it to episode four or five and then I just couldn't take it anymore and jump to the finale. I'm just gonna see if they do a good job of ending it, but I hope they don't do this again on prime, as it was in my opinion, and experiment that failed.And while I am here, can someone please tell me why every movie has to show somebody brushing their teeth!?! It's one of the grossest things out there and we don't need it to humanise the person. Just the same as we don't need to see someone sitting on the toilet to know that there are human being.",IMDB,Bloody aweful,3.0
"My teenage daughter and I randomly picked this show to stream last weekend. We were hooked after the 2nd episode. The premise of being in an arranged spy marriage is silly, but it provides plenty of opportunities to examine what it takes to make a marriage work (trust), complicated by the dynamic of being spies.The dialogue is witty and fun. The chemistry between Donald Glover and Maya Erskine was earned, starting with the awkward flirting at the beginning and developing into the typical marriage conversations (who doesn't joke about farts?) and the stupid arguments that come from being around someone too much and/or being secure about the relationship at the end.I don't usually leave reviews but after reading a few here, it seems like my daughter and I watched a completely different series. I also watched the Brad Pitt / Angelina Jolie movie many years ago, which was light-hearted fun. This is much deeper and more enjoyable, in my humble opinion. I do hope we get a season 2!",IMDB,"Loved it, please make a season 2",10.0
"In the start of the first episode they kill off Eiza González and Alexander Skarsgård portraying Jane & John Smith. The signal sent to us here is : Sorry this a series without hot people. Lets just kill them off and replace them with a very unnoticable couple. The acting performance by Maya Erskine and Donald Glover is mediocre at best and they have absolutely no chemistry.. If they had killed off Maya and Donald instead and continued with Alexander and Eiza this would have been a hit, but no lets make a series with poor lead characters. Who wants that? Sorry, but that is not what we want. Production quality outside of terrible lead characters is ok. This is a mess and hopefully they will not waste money on another season.

"I absolutely loved this series! The acting of Donald Glover and Maya Erskine is top notch, not to mention the incredible guest actors and well written characters they portray. I was a fan of the original movie, and while this series is a departure in some ways, I appreciate that it goes deeper and feels much more contemporary all at once. There's still some Hollywood magic, a good amount of action and beautiful scenery, but this series appeals to a more nuanced audience too. I really enjoyed the insightful storytelling and humanity of the characters. This series manages to do it all, comedy, drama, adventure and I will rewatch for the subtle moments too.

"This show is great? I'm not sure why everyone is lying in the comments, maybe because the show doesn't center them? Thought it was well-written, superbly directed, and had great acting... I was completely engaged every episode of this season and I'm hoping the show runs at least two more seasons. At this point, Glover and co. Are masters of the television landscape and i'll be on board for whatever he creates.

Don't be a loser, check it out, it's a great show.",IMDB,Better than expected.,10.0
"The series begins with the suggestion that the original characters were killed. I like the first episode because it is different from the movie. I also like how they are attempting to grow the characters' connection instead of us having to image it magically exists as you find with most movies and series. Change the name of series and title characters and no one would link it to the movie. The movie was good, but it was not great. I prefer the series over the movie. Yes, there is killing, but the body count was higher in the movie. The movie was given a pass because it was syrupy, and the series is a dark comedy. Finally, fictional movies and series for me a just that and nothing more. Have fun watching, I know I will. Thank you, Amazon.",IMDB,"Excellent casting, like how they are attempting to build character relationship",10.0
"I'm not sure this series could start out any slower. The two leads are mechanical and honestly both are unlikeable. Alexander Skarsgård and Parker Posey who begin episode one are much better. The ""Missions"" are far from the old Mission Impossible TV show but almost as boring and predictable. The future previews are almost entirely action which rarely takes place in the first two I watched. The dialogue is tedious and robotic. The teases that these two non personalities like each other or eventually will have some spark between them is hard to imagine.

"I found myself laughing heartily out loud at the realistic everyday things that people do that's brought out in this story line. The acting is Superb and the writing & directing so spot on GOOD! I'm now a fan of these two actors, Donald Glover and Maya Erskin. Most people aren't killers or spies except in their daydreams but the series is so much fun I can hardly wait to see the next one when i get through an episode. Glover not only is the star of the show but he plays a very likeable character that I sense has a lot of his real self in it. He also wrote the story line and has directed and produced some of it. Maya is totally cool too and genuinely funny and appears to lose herself in some of her acting which seems so real. They are Very Good! WATCH IT!

I don't write reviews usually but this one I felt like I had to.. because I was shocked like what's the heck I'm watching right now! What is happening!!!! There's a lot of things that are missing, i felt like I regretted its just a lot if talking whyyyy why why... actually i'm now in episode 6.. and i hope it gets better in the end.",IMDB,I don't know.,1.0
"Loved it. Exceeded my expectations. Well written, directed and acted with beautiful cinematography. I don't get why some people are hating. Do people really prefer a boring, fight fight fight action sequences all throughout their movie? I like this version of Smiths better because it's more relatable as they have their own flaws and insecurities. And it showed that there are more than one way to build an interesting character. Yes, it's exciting to see extremely competent characters executing their jobs with surgical precision, but it gets boring sometimes, and we can use a breath of fresh air.

"Patience is a virtue, and ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" in this Amazon Prime redux, created by the talented duo Donald Glover and Francesca Sloane, is a testament to that. At first glance, it may seem like a rehash of the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie classic, but give it a chance, and you'll find a show that delves deeper into the human experience.The initial episodes may feel a bit slow and deterministic, but they're better than your average formulaic show; it's all part of the build-up. The real magic happens in the final couple of episodes, where the show absolutely peaks. The connection between John Smith (also played excellently by Glover himself) and Maya Erskine's Jane Smith will leave you in awe.What sets ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" apart is its exploration of the mundane aspects of humanity within the context of something sexy and not directly relatable (being mercenary spies for what particular mercenary agency (or are they?!)). The characters become the most intriguing when everything's on the line, including their own relationship and lives.If you're wondering whether you have enough time to watch another streaming show, I say, ""frickin' watch this thing to the end."" It's worth it, and you'll thank me later. So, buckle up and get ready for a rollercoaster ride of mystique, suspense, and humanity with ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith,"" starring the weirdly relatable duo of Donald Glover and Maya Erskine.",IMDB,"starts slow, ends strong (watch to the end! :-)",8.0
"I loved this show! It was everything I hoped for from a show with Donald Glover involved.Too many shows set up a thin premise and then deliver the same drama, action, or comedy we've seen a million times. Why not acknowledge that the premise is absurd and USE that?! But no, for some reason shows restrict the absurd to comedies like Seinfeld, when in reality it happens all the time, including in drama and action. That acknowledgement of the obvious absurdity makes the show more relatable, which heightens the drama/comedy/action.Consider the original film with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Did the thought ever cross your mind that one might genuinely eliminate the other? No...of course not.The suspense was undercut by the film's adherence to a 'safe' narrative. This is far too common and I'm tired of it.With this show, you can't know what is going to happen because it acknowledges that the world is messy and things aren't wrapped up in a bow. Episode 1 makes this very clear. So for the rest of the series you are never quite sure if they will follow the usual trope or not.Anyway, you don't have to like it, but it is certainly different and was a breath of fresh air for me.",IMDB,A standout in the sea of formulaic entertainment,10.0
"Don't go in thinking this is going to be action-driven. It isn't at all. It feels like they are being forced to write action scenes, which clearly they don't want to do. And the actions scenes they write are by-the-book, meaningless to the entire story, and quite boring.What am i watching?And here i had high hopes when i saw the trailers. It looked like a fun ride. Once again, don't trust trailers.I went in knowing it would be totally different from the movie. I even knew i was expecting more relationship stuff. But wow, this is terrible.It seems to only care about a forced ad-lib sessions between the two actors in what feels like two teenagers pretending to be spies.You never feel they are spies at all. They feel very incompetent in their job. It also feels the writers don't know how to write action scenes or what spy films are.What am i watching (again)?Donald Glover is likeable, as always. The woman actor is okay, i guess. But it feels the writers have nothing to say and just think having meaningless banter between these ""spies"" is what people came to see. Who cares what is being said, it is just the idea of a man and a woman in the same room ragging on each other and then kissing and f'ing is what matters only. OH COME ON! Anyone can write this stuff. This is film school 101 garbage.The action is far and few and when it comes it is as basic and pointless as they come. Again, it feels like the production company enforced they write action and they then angrily write some weak action scene which lasts maybe 2 mins for the entire episode and then we are back to the boring, pointless, and very superficial love stuff.The best i can describe this is it is written by teeneagers who have never written a love story, never scene action films, and don't know how to write a proper screen play. They were just given a great budget and told to make something.Real shame. The concept is good. The actors are good. But the execution is terrible.I've only watched 5 of the 9 episodes of this season and i am cringing so much that i decided to come write this review, rather than finish the last 4 episodes. I just can't do it.",IMDB,It Feels like It's Forced Filler With Total Contempt For Action Scenes,1.0
"First and foremost, the story line was simply gold. I love that it lightly plays on the 2005 Mr. & Mrs. Smith dynamic but gives the whole show its own character. The character dynamics were fantastic, and we love the dry humor! I think the writing and actors were a perfect choice. The only thing I can say is though we love a good cliff hanger and set up to a season 2, I WILL ABSOLUTELY LOSE MY MIND IF THE SHOW DOESN'T FOLLOW UP WITH A SECOND SEASON. I am simply so invested, I want to see the characters develop even more into the story line. The action to romance was done tastefully and not too overbearing on either side.

"You love nonsensical plot lines that have no basis in reality and love your main characters to be sociopathic losers.Guy and gal answer IT ad and interview with machine.

First assignment is to steal package from middle age woman and deliver to set of coordinates that turn out to be the location of a mansion being prepped for a party. During seizure of the package it's tossed and dropped but on delivery is seen to contain a very fancy decorated cake that somehow shows no damage. Many caterers and others in the house that blows up as if a nuke has been dropped on it killing almost a dozen. Our hero's are not the least bothered by the carnage even though they have no idea who the people were or why they were murdered. Just a few giggles about how they signed up for the dangerous assignments. It goes downhill from there in the next episode.Nobody to root for in this show and thus far stories are ridiculous and boring.

"Really good. I know people were going to hate this, because it's two humans who look like humans hooking up. But it's so much more than that. The two main characters really do grow on you, and I ended up caring about them in a way I rarely get to do these days. Love Donald Glover, and he manages to appear kinda annoying making their marriage problems feel more real. Someone already mentioned that the show has a similar tone to Atlanta, also written by Donald Glover, and it really does.One of the reasons I ranked this so high is how much I appreciate how chill this show was. I'm so exhausted by current crime/ mystery shows having the most in depth, way too complicated plot with a million characters, usually dealing with corruption, politics, you name it. That's all good, if that's what you're into, but I was so happy this show just focused on the characters and didn't have a boring corruption case that I had to follow. Side characters mainly functions to create interesting situations for the mains, and we barely learn anybody else's name. Honestly, I needed that.",IMDB,Refreshingly chill and human,9.0

If you go into this looking for a full on action film you will be disappointed. This is a relationship series with comedy and enough actuon to keep it fun and lively.

"""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (2024) bursts onto the screen with a dynamism and depth that redefine what it means to adapt a beloved story. With a script that crackles with wit and emotion, this series is a tour de force in modern storytelling. Set against the backdrop of trust, pride, power dynamics, and love, it resonates on multiple levels, eliciting laughter, gasps, and introspection.The writing is the true star here: thoughtful, memorable, and textured---singed with layers of meaning and literary references, including Khalil Gibran's ""The Prophet,"" a book of 26 prose poetry fables. The show navigates themes of trust in strangers, pride and prejudice, the nuanced power dynamics between the sexes, and the complexities of love and teamwork with finesse. Each episode is a masterclass in narrative construction, weaving together action-packed sequences with moments of genuine human connection. Unadulterated honesty.Donald Glover's performance as ""Mr. Smith"" is a revelation. He brings a depth and charisma that elevates the character beyond mere action hero tropes. His portrayal is fun yet weighty, fearless yet vulnerable---a ""Daddy Rollin' Stone"" type of sexy that is as pensive as it is magnetic. Glover's ability to inhabit the role with such nuance is a testament to his multifaceted talent.Maya Erskine shines as ""Mrs. Smith,"" delivering a performance that is nothing short of showstopping. Her portrayal is nuanced, grounded, and believable, capturing the essence of a complex character with effortless grace. Erskine's chemistry with Glover is palpable, creating a rich on-screen partnership that drives the series forward with intensity and charm.The absence of Phoebe Waller-Bridge is hardly felt, as the series confidently charts its own course with a fresh perspective. The script's language is sharp and dynamic, hitting its marks with precision and wit. It's a joy to witness the characters evolve and grow, each revelation and twist adding to the richness of the narrative.One of the series' standout qualities is its soundtrack---a gem that complements the action and emotion on screen perfectly. It's a choice selection that enhances every scene, leaving viewers humming its tunes long after the credits roll.I found myself re-watching the series multiple times, each viewing revealing new layers and secrets. The surprise twist at the end is a stroke of genius, delivering a satisfying conclusion while leaving room for future exploration. It's a testament to the series' ability to keep viewers engaged and invested in its characters' journeys.Comparisons to the 2005 film starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are inevitable, but this adaptation stands tall on its own merits. It exceeds expectations, offering a fresh take that honors the original while boldly venturing into new territory. For those unfamiliar with the 1941 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this series serves as a compelling introduction to the timeless tale of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith.""In conclusion, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (2024) is a triumph of modern television, blending action, romance, and intrigue into a compelling narrative that leaves a lasting impression. With stellar performances, exceptional writing, and a soundtrack that delights, it's a series that demands attention. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a thrilling and thought-provoking viewing experience. Stop what you're doing and watch it now---you won't be disappointed.Linette Marie Allen

"I like action. I also like comedies. This series is labelled as an action comedy, but so far I have seen very little action, and no comedy whatsoever.The pacing is unbearably sloooow, and the writer/director/editor have no clues how to tell a story efficiently. The dialogue is cringeworthy, long-winded and babbling, unfunny and getting nowhere very slowly. Nothing happens, just relationship talk and ""yeah, okay, yeah"". There's maybe two minutes of (very lame) action near the end of each episode, and the storylines make no sense.Even worse than this, though, is the abysmal acting. C- and D-list extras in every single role, and absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between the leads. Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves and have a hard think about changing careers. Maybe working in the sewers - less public and more suited to their abilities to work with fecal matter.",IMDB,"No action, no comedy",1.0
"The show is intelligent, personable, well written/acted/directed. Love it, no complaints at all... except: In the 1st or 2nd episode, Jane buys breakfast for John.

I find it amazing that someone, anyone, on the staff of the show didn't catch this foolish & completely avoidable error. Doesn't anyone review the script pre-taping? Was the take so amazing that the director/editor/show runner knew of the error but assumed the audience was unsophisticated or distracted or completely unfamiliar with lox &/or salmon that no one would notice?

I haven't compared the show to the film of the same name, so my opinion is only on a show that should be capable of so much more, but just keeps running in slow motion.

Good job👍anyone would enjoy this. I think and hope that we get 6 seasons and a movie! 6 seasons and a Movie! Lol Glover is authentic and doesn't seem to be chasing anything but artist expression. Which is the way it should be. I do believe a majority of actors look at are just looking for that fat check, fame whatever. The truley great actors/musicains make art. They make you feel something other than angry or broke.",IMDB,Great show,10.0
"Long cringy conversations between Donald & Maya is all you're getting. The worst part is that if they were on shrooms, weed, or some other psychedelic, then at least the dialogue might be interesting in a metaphysical sense, but no.Imagine watching 2 people with zero chemistry, who don't appear to have any physical attraction to each other.... and the guy is constantly begging the chick to have sex with him. Like a ZILLION times and she keeps rejecting him. Ongoing painful cringe.And their total lack of spy skills?! They almost lost the slow walking 90 yr old lady who they were supposed to be tailing and tracking. You can't help but think to yourself, how bad would you have to be to not be able to keep up with an old lady who couldn't move any slower unless she was crawling!!They seem to get lost in their own world of long pauses, long stares, and words/dialogue that you could probably over-hear in any random airport at any time throughout the day.It is like she is supposed to be mysterious and sexy, but she isn't. He is supposed to be thoughtful and clever, but he's not. Since when did anyone start to think that two (2) cringy nerds with no skills, no chemistry, and a total lack of good writing for the sake of realism would be entertaining?",IMDB,Donald Glover is the New King of Cringe!,2.0
I actually really liked this show. More than I thought I would. I checked it out because I liked the Mr & Mrs Smith movies but I really couldn't figure out why they'd try to make it into a series. So I was sceptical that I would enjoy it. But I really think it's great and the chemistry between the main actors is great. They really seem to bounce off each other. It's the right amount of funny and action and romance with all of the awkwardness that comes with each. It makes the characters really likeable.My only complaint is the cinematography. This show has definitely fallen victim to the dark cinematography trend where it always looks like someone has turned off all the lights or somehow dimmed the sun. I'm not sure why that has become a trend but it adds a level of cheesiness to everything. I hope if they ever make another season they aren't afraid to turn the lights on. No one likes watching something they can barely see.,IMDB,I liked more than I thought I would,8.0
"Weirdly boring for a tv show about spies. There is also no character development, and we don't find out anything about the characters or their pasts (until maybe the last ep). Both main characters also come across as selfish and just unlikeable, so there is nothing to root for. I also found it quite predictable. The acting in the last ep was great though. I guess I was cheering them on at the very end, but only because the other characters were somehow even worse.Disappointing for a show with such big names attached, just poor writing imo. It was all very on the nose, felt like I was getting hit over the head who was evil and not. Would've made for a much more interesting show if they let us ponder about the moral quandaries of all the characters. Good premise, incredibly poor execution. Left it on a cheap cliffhanger too.",IMDB,Boring and obvious,4.0
If you read through the negative reviews you'll notice a trend that it's just people who were disappointed that this isn't the Angelina Jolie sequel. This is a smart and thought provoking story that has a lot of substance. It beautifully tells a story of two people making a marriage work through the ups and downs all while traveling the world completing spy missions. It leans more on the relationship side of things but it has plenty of shoot em up scenes as well as a ton of laughs. This is an easy 10/10 for me. Thank goodness this got renewed for season 2 because although the show could be billed as a mini series there's still so much to explore between the two characters and the unique spy world they live in.,IMDB,Fantastic spy show about marriage,10.0
"Tell me you didn't understand the show with out telling me you didn't understand the show. Are people rating this with out even watching it? I don't actually think the show is a 10 but a solid 8. People are being too harsh on this show because it's not a copy of the original movie. I thought we wanted more originality... I guess not. Overall I loved it. Donald Glover is very talented. I can't wait to see what else he creates. And there is absolutely a throw back to the movie when they ""try"" to kill each other. I hope they get a second season. I need to know who Hihi is.. and do they live? My only complaint is that I have no clue on the timeline. But that's it.",IMDB,Tell me you didn't understand the show with out telling me you didn't understand the show,10.0
"Ignore the Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie movie, this is the exact opposite. John and Jane Smith are rookie recruits of an organisation (CIA? FBI? SMERSH?) that are thrown together to do 'things' that are clearly undercover ops, but they are never told why they are doing them. The first episode, ok it sets the scene (although Jane, the one who's never killed anyone before, seems not to question the mortality of killing 9 anonymous people at a family get-together).Episode 2 involves trying to get a pervy at liver to 'soul the beans' about something out other - we never discover who he is, what he knows it why the information is so essential to their secret organisation.Episode 3 require or inexperienced couple to plant bugs on the phones of a married couple in a ski resort. Sharon Horgan is sadly wasted in a walk-on role as the woman in distress. Why the bugs? Dunno. Who are this couple of interest? Dunno. Why is she kidnapped, by whom, and what are our heroes supposed to do about it? Dunno, but a good excuse for some random killing of the abductors, a ski mobile chase, and some cheap attempt at humour regarding thawing out John's penis after he had a roll in the snow
Episode 4... Oh, I can't be bothered to watch it
Overall, a poorly written attempt to cash in on the movie's reputation, think I'd rather watch The Rookie, at least there is some sort of discernable plot.",IMDB,"Starts well, quickly descends into chaos",4.0
"I loved this show. A perfect balance between character development, spy-thrills, and exotic movie locations. Donald Glover and Maya Erksine have great chemistry as two somewhat neurotic CIA wannabes who get paired together as covert operative/assassins with a mysterious handler known as ""Hihi"". Donald plays ""John"", a sensitive-strong Black man who cares for a loving mother who happens to have a military background and enjoys yoga and green tea. Maya, having failed her CIA-entrance exam due to being a ""psychological sociopath"" is excellent in her role as a quirky and intelligent ""Jane"" with a bit more tendency to ""shoot first"" before asking. Together, they exude a down-to-earth clumsy realism that is absent in this and perhaps most genres today. This is a ""get-to-know-you"" love story superimposed upon a hysterically comical but dangerous spy craft theme that takes the viewer to some really beautiful and intimate movie set locations. Best show I've seen this year. I wish I hadn't binge watched it but rather savored it over the course of a few weeks. The ending is ambiguous so here's to hoping there's a second season.",IMDB,This is a love story first and foremost,10.0
"Slow, no chemistry, too much rambling, long moments of silence with no substance.We had no delusions that it would be anything like the movie.It has very little spy action and no good plots.There is no closure on any of the episodes for the actual assignments.We were really looking forward to this series and are extremely disappointed!The constant small talk / chattering is irritating and boring.Too many holes in the plots.When typing on phone and tablets you can't see what they are saying.We turned on Closed caption but it doesn't show us what was typed.Each episode that we watched could or should have been cut in half and we wouldn't have missed anything.",IMDB,We were looking forward to this.......but yikes,2.0
"First off this has nothing to do with the movie with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie other than it's a couple who are both spies. The beginning starts off a little slow but once it gets going it is so refreshingly brilliant I don't even know where to begin. The writing and the acting is so beyond and it feels so genuine authentic and fresh. Not to mention it's as much of a drama, action and comedy all wrapped into one. I really love how the two primary characters execute their relationship as married and spies because it feels real. My favorite scene thus far is when John goes completely off on Jane at the campfire. I had to rewind that back 3x. It was just so amazing and then when she closed the scene asking about his emergency contact and she says you're mine you feel so bad for her after she just got chewed through the ringer. It's so good that I'm nervous to keep watching because I don't know how much longer they can keep this going. It's that good!",IMDB,Absolutely Brilliant I love it,10.0
"As many have noted, the new ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" series takes a different route from the original, and that's okay. While it nods to the source material with scattered references, it avoids the trap of being a mere replica.John, portrayed by Donald Glover, emerges as a more likeable character, while Jane, played by Maya Erskine, leans towards the mysterious and selfish, albeit somewhat one-dimensional. The chemistry between them, while not reminiscent of the original cast, is well-acted and exhibits a subtler, non-sexual tension that aligns with the altered premise.However, the series falters in its lack of a compelling underlying plot and resolution. While the Smiths navigate through various missions and experience personal conflicts, the absence of a shared objective, big reveal, significant plot twists, or cathartic resolution leaves the narrative feeling somewhat incomplete.Despite my initial skepticism, the series managed to surpass my expectations. Yet, like many shows, it falls short of its full potential and could have benefited from a more cohesive storyline and resolution.",IMDB,Better and worse than expected,8.0
"15 minute in I'm already a hater so I had to pause it and read a few reviews (no spoilers) to adjust my perspective.So before going in I had to 1. Remove my expectations based on the Brad Pit and Angelina Joilee Mr and Mrs Smith 2. View this as an Atlanta (the show) coded programme in the form of spies and 3. View this more of a Marriage/relationship type series as opposed to a Spy heavy on the action film.Turns out I love this show, its everything I expected from Donald Glover and the Atlanta crew, very interested in this Actress Maya Erskine first time watching her preform and impressed with the analogies they insert on relationship conversations especially the ""child"" episode.I grew to adore their on screen chemistry and can't wait to see how they will continue the story in Season 2 if there is to be any.",IMDB,Not what I expected,8.0
"The writing is stilted and boring. If I wanted to listen to ""real"" conversations, I'd turn on realty TV. The characters are not likeable. They laugh after their first kill without knowing why the killed them. This is fine, but then don't try to portray them as likeable characters.Make them characters you love to hate or show them wrestling with what they've done. This could be good with writing making you question the motives of the main characters, loving them one minute, questioning them the next, etc., but these characters are just plain boring.Plus, they're not particularly good at their jobs, which could add some comedy, but instead ads to lackluster character development.",IMDB,"Stilted, boring, unknown character motives",2.0

"There is too much inane dialog and not enough action. The acting is just so-so and most of the dialog could be written by a romantic 10th grader. Scenes that could have been titillating were simply banal. I was surprised by the well-known actors in these parts and cannot imagine them enjoying the results. By episode 3 I was wondering why I was wasting my time. I didn't like these characters and the plot was simply unbelievable.

"The first season has all you can want in a show: action, drama, suspense, romance, heartbreak. I genuinely was concerned coming in as the film (Jolie & Pitt) is a decent action film. However, I believe the show is much better and worth a watch. The guest appearances from various actors add a nice touch.The only reason I don't rate this show as a 10 is because I believe John (portrayed by Donald Glover) is far more likable as a character than Jane (portrayed by Maya Erskine). This isn't for lack of acting as Maya portrays the character beautifully. In addition, the ending to the series is a bit predictable. Other than this, I have no complaints.",IMDB,Season One is a Must Watch,9.0
"This is a brilliantly complex take on what marriage is actually like. The spy premise makes it hysterical, but it also captures the stakes and the emotional reality. When the characters laughed, so did I. There were a few times when I had to suspend disbelief, but I was too absorbed in character to linger over what would normally be a dealbreaker.Casting was also pitch perfect. I fell in love with the Smith's but also with Denise. Her brief time on screen was comforting.

"There's a reason it was nominated for 16 emmys.....I know what you're thinking, 'the best?' Here are 3 simple supporting statements.It's relatable:
Every episode touches on the shared human experience. We all know what it's like to have nervous energy when meeting someone new or tight-roping a situation of politeness, when being annoyed by someone.It's poignant:
So many times throughout the show, a moving moment anchores the drop of this roller-coaster. The expansion of the story from the movie allows for a better character connection and understanding. John's sense of humor vs Jane's for example.It's an upsurge:
Each episode is better than the previous. This is just a plain result of phenomenal writing. Even in a situation of a day off were the action understandably should be dialed down, the viewer is still left with a 'I didn't see that coming' moment every time.Honestly, 2 wins is a bit of a insult to such a supremely well executed project.",IMDB,"Hands down, the greatest scripted of 2024",10.0
"So, if you've read other reviews, you know that this isn't really a remake/adaptation of the Brangelina movie. Spy movies have suspense, intense action scenes, intrigue, and in the case of the Brangelina version, like the U. N. C. LE. Movie and many others, they are fun.There's none of that here. They purposefully skip the action scenes and cut to the characters' faces in the aftermath, to focus on their emotional reactions.I thought ""ok, this is different, let's give it a go"". So I watched maybe six episodes, not sure, but gave up in the middle of it.The emotional tension is not interesting enough, the relationship between the two protagonists isn't interesting enough and the fact that it's a brand new story every episode, meaning there are very few (if any) recurring characters, makes this feel like a cheap police procedural.Also, Donald Glover doesn't look to me, and doesn't move, like the kind of guy who could kill people for a living. I'm not sure he's ever punched someone in the face in his entire life. You know in which movie I had the entirely opposite experience? Tenet. I saw John David Washington in the kitchen fight, I thought ""hold on a second, this guy can MOVE"", so I googled him and realised he played football in high school and considered going pro.The female protagonist looks even more harmless. If only the filmmakers only allowed me to SEE them in action scenes and change my mind about what they can or can't do. But no. Emotional drama is more important.This is a soap opera with spies. If you're a cat lady or the male equivalent of one, you'll probably enjoy this. If not, Skip!",IMDB,Skip!,2.0
"Something I liked about this show is there's always stuff happening that you wouldn't think would happen. It kept you on your toes. You think something is gonna go one way and it goes the other.I wish there was more explaining the end. Or at least we could have seen what happens at the end that was the only problem I had with the show.I loved that cast. I feel like I've never seen these actors in a lot of movies, especially having childish gambino in it was fun cause people who like his music are more likely to watch it now.Their love story was my favorite how it took until the end when they are about to die to realize how much they love each other.",IMDB,Surprises,10.0

I couldn't even be bothered finishing it because it's just like someone is spilling their trauma onto a page for everyone else to ""enjoy"". Oh wait I did finish it I just forgot because of how forgettable it is.The writing is stilted and dialogue is laughable but pretty cinematography.There are points where I think they're getting to a point but it seems like they want to continue to edge infinitesimally to absolutely nothing.If I wanted to see people moving around scenic Europe at least Top Gear had a cohesive narrative and a goal. From close to the offset it's established there is no end beyond being killed. Can you even call what they do foreshadowing? Foreshadowing for children who shouldn't be watching something as violent and relationship wise... just a bad perspective on how that works. Even the zingers dialogue wise are flat. It's trying to be Mr Robot without any of the writing.The episode with Sharon Horgan seemed really interesting, almost. Parker Posey did a lot of heavy lifting as well. Every other couple seemed more interesting. I can't find the episode now but the one where John is playing cards and Jane sniping is the best.",IMDB,Seems like a vanity project cooked up by a child,4.0
"It's surprising this show hasn't gotten more attention/praise. Maybe some expected more of an action genre based on the previous movie. This is something much more unique. An average rating of 7 for a new show on imdb is definitely under representing the quality here. Rarely do you get well written characters like this in any show, let alone in a show that is not only a drama but also a comedy/ action. A really unique show. I think it will be trending above a 7 in the months to come. My only gripe is that the 'spy"" situations could have used more detail/realism. I think it would of only added to the situational humor and character building this show does so well. I could see some taking issues with the way the timeline and pace of the show changes/skips forward a bit sporadically, but I think it works. You can tell the cast/crew really gelled on this one. Having the Glover brothers writing together makes for some great dialogue. I can't wait for season 2.",IMDB,Incredibly fun,8.0

"So I saw the trailers for Mrs. & Mrs. Smith. I wasn't impressed. I love Donald Glover as one of the most exciting talents out there, but man in the trailers they were unconvincing as spies and killers. I had seen the original movie with Brad and Angelina when it came out and I thought it was entertaining enough, but I haven't seen it again since it was released.My partner asked me if I wanted to watch the TV show. I grudgingly said yes to make her happy and for compromise. The first episode was decent.THE PLUSES:
I was actually Amazed by the naked raw honesty of the couple's relationships, the dialouge, their connection. This was by far the most compelling for me. This was a couple's awkward meet, growing a relationship together in a challenging environment, and their complete devolving of their love story. I loved this so very much. This could have been a romantic drama. There were moments of such real uncomfortably recognizable truth, I actually had to look away a couple times. Really well done.The guest stars from Pearlman to Paulson do good work with their single episodes.THE MINSUSES:Only two: I rarely ever believed these two people were convincing martial artists, fighters, spies.Why would John tell a rival spy all the details of Jane and him and details of their cases. It's Unbelievably inane. I cannot believe he would have done that. Putting them all at risk. From a writing standpoint: it's preposterous that a spy would do this.I read there is a season 2 in the works however the two lead actors are unlikely to return.Really good show. Episodes ranged from 7 to 8.5.",IMDB,My thoughts on this show,8.0
"Let me start by saying I had high hopes for this series, because I am a huge fan of the movie, Mr. And Mrs. Smith. I was highly anticipating a creative new, take on the movie with the series, very much excited about the diverse casting, and hoping for an action packed series with intrigue, spy/assassin activities, and a splash of romance.But what I saw was anything but intriguing. Can you say boring, painfully, slow, excruciating relationship bs, overshadowing a lackluster, completely horrible storyline, that was written by people that clearly hated the original movie, hate viewers and generally hate everyone.Like why??!! Why do you make Jane and John tiny frail actors with not one muscle in sight who cannot fight and have no abilities to complete a mission in the first four episodes then all of a sudden they become these great fighters and supers spies. Say what now??They are so naïve to the world of being a spy that they meet another spy couple and immediately allow them to come into their home just because they also are spies. Are you kidding me? Like what kind of spies are you??Then the relationship drama, and the dysfunction in the relationship completely overtook the whole entire series from episodes 5 through 8 to the point where they were completely unwatchable and a huge waste of time.Like where are the missions, and why would they trust you to complete these missions known that you were clearly amateurs. The original chain and Jon were the real deal and that's why they were exciting to watch because they were affective and entertaining and they handled their business like pros. Yet they were relatable and funny, and their romance was real, even though they had a ton of sect.This was thrown together with no real spark, which was very creepy and uncomfortable to watch. They clearly had no chemistry whatsoever in the movie or in real life. And therefore this couple is unbelievable, and should have just been coworkers. On top of that who wants to root for their relationship we were not invested whatsoever. Because we didn't see any redeeming qualities from either of them. They were awkward and hard to watch. And no one was rooting for them at all. The only person I was rooting for was Jon's mom to make sure that she was safe and OK.And, let's address the counseling sessions. They should've been simply sprinkled throughout the series. Why would you instead create full episodes of the short series surrounded by the counseling sessions then make the action inspire activities, simply flashbacks that reiterate, the relationship drama.That was an unwise move and so far away from the original series that did not focus on the relationship, but focused on the spy piece. Then the relationship took over because it was so intriguing. This was trying to force this dry unbelievable, and entertaining relationship down our throat. It was very gross to watch.Then why? Why? Why in the world would you set that woman's house on fire because she recorded the sessions. Like a spy that doesn't read the fine print as to what you signed when you join the sessions? Like, who wrote this? This was very poor Writing to the point where it seemed amateur.I mean, I totally just wanted to throw the TV listening to this couple squabble for entire episodes. Did you understand that these TV series is supposed to entertain the audience not annoy them to no end? Was that not understood when you took the job of writing? Did you understand that these TV series is supposed to entertain the audience not annoy them to no end? Was that not understood when you took the job of writing this series?The episodes did not build on one. Another, were not cohesive, and the character development was nonexistent. Who were these characters and why were they even here? We know nothing of substance about them, and we're at the result, uninvested.The conflict did not even make sense, and the ending where you finally bring in hints from the movie when it came to this big showdown of them trying to unalive each other was completely Out of left field. We had no understanding of what constitutes the couple being eliminated, why Jane was the star and Jon was the problematic spy who couldn't cut it. Like excuse me? Who came up with that idea? Jane all of a sudden can beat up grown men , with one hand tied behind her back, while Jon could barely complete a mission without Jane stepping in. Lol...you suck.Then you try to insert elements of diversity by bringing John around his black friends, or peers only for Jane to step in and ruin every situation and feel personally attacked. Are you kidding me?This made her even more unlikable and was painful to watch. Overall, this was completely awful writing, boring acting, and unrealistic and awful execution. And on top of that the soundtrack to these episodes were so bad and weird, that I had to mute my TV for long periods of time.Like way to push further garbage down our throats with this.I think one star is generous for this bs because the first episode was decent. It could've been funny, clever, and unique. But ended up being a total flop and waste of time.Please hire some actual writers who understand, audiences, genres, plot, And story.

I came back at the end where it appears that the bathtub antics got them ""hot"" and they went at it on the couch. Yeah this is great television. NOT. And pandering to the times.

They find the lady and Glover looks like such a doofus, so poorly cast, and such a worthless actor, in this part, I could not watch another seccond of this bad idea badly executed.

So don't humanize them then. They were killing machines, let them be killing machines.The humor in the first 2 episodes were okay.

Think I will revert to re-watching some old stuff so at least I do not have to hurt my brain by trying to figure out what the heck I am watching.

Spoiler warning they killed the fricken cat. Also the story is like really depressing and sad. Sad face emoji. Then they tried to make it funny with a lot of action in between but that made it more sad. And why did they get together in like the second episode. They should have prolonged it more. Anyways I had higher expectations for this show the first episode was really good but then all of the episodes became more sad and also they killed the fricken cat. There was a lot of really good things that happened in the show but I wish this show was better. I'm sorry if you're reading this expecting a better review this show kinda sad. Don't know if that your thing or not but I'm so sad that they killed the fricken cat.,IMDB,They killed the cat,4.0
I wonder if people are objectively watching this or not. The ratings for this don't make any sense. It's a mediocre show with mediocre dialogue. There's some good moments in this but there's just not enough for it to be compelling and a second season but I've seen shows this awful get multiple seasons and it seems like Glover is Amazon's golden goose so to speak. I'm a fan of Glover (his music and acting) but this show just didn't hit the notes for me for being different and better than the Mr and Mrs Smith movie and 90s show. I don't see this as a remake but a reboot of both old properties with a new spin.The Americans to me does a far better job of this sort of premise. That is what this show could have been but failed to be.,IMDB,Pure trash,1.0
"So clearly like most people, I was expecting it to be like the movie. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are a married couple and both spies but they don't know this and discover about each other which was the most fun part of the highly forgettable one time watch movie.I was hoping this would take a more serious and darker take on the movie which it did seem to with the opening scene, where jane and john have fallen in love and gone rogue now the agency needs to take them out, off the a great start.Then you get 2 misfits put together as a pretend couple to carry out missions, their first mission is delivering a package which turns out to be a bomb that kills 9 people and these idiots celebrate their success of the mission instead of questioning anything they carry out these type of useless missions and get paid.The part where this turns to a real mess is it all becomes about their pretend marriage and their feelings about each other and how those feelings affect their professionalism.If you are looking for a spy thriller action show this isn't it, its just a bore fest after first episode, don't expect any twist or the curtain to be pulled to expose the mickey mouse agency.",IMDB,What an Absolute MESS!!!,3.0

Also stopped watching the Jennifer Lopez movie about her wedding that's taken over by terrorists and after she and her fiancee kill in the jungle, she asks ""You killed someone, how does it feel?"" and the guy says ""Good, it feels good"" and I immediately clicked out.

"This is another show in a genre of Unreality, in this case a spy show that is completely removed from this world.But what bothers me most is just how incompetent they are. They're just like random people, but dumber. No tradecraft, no discipline. When doing their first surveillance assignment in a restaurant, they talk loudly about the assignment and about their jobs as spies...She even asks him if he's killed anyone. Loudly. In a restaurant.They literally crane their necks, in unison, to stare at their target. It's unbelievable.And he asks her so many questions about her background, previous jobs, etc. The day the first meet. There's just no way anyone would do that in their position, no way she would answer. Rather, she would pull the plug immediately, report him, tell their superiors that this guy is some kind of traitor or brain injured.These are just random idiots, not spies. Apparently they're also failures from previous agencies or something, which was weird and unexplained. Who would hire them? But even such failures would operate at a much higher level than this.They were so shallow and empty as humans that I couldn't care about them. I mean, who would want that life? Who would sign up for it? And they're stupid, which ruins everything. Their lives are meaningless - they're not admirable people doing something that matters.",IMDB,"Incompetent characters, weirdly shallow",3.0

Everything else fell short for me. The dialogue was horrible, especially in the theater scene. It was too slowly paced.Amazon is really letting us down lately.

The second thing I can't understand is why they chose an actress so ugly that makes you not want to look at the screen. She is obviously a good actress but not for a protagonistic role as she's not easy on the eyes. Maybe she would be a good fit for a second role of an intelligent maid or a cold businesswoman but not as a protagonist..I never had to look away in a (heterosexual) romantic scene before in my life. Also they don't match as a couple.",IMDB,Could be very good but...,5.0
Trailer seem like a fun action series but it is not is a basic it is a Rom Com/drama series. There are very few actions scenes but when they finally show up they are really well done. Donald Glover and Maya Erksine have pretty good chemistry between them but bloody hell there is so much talking about basically nothing. There are very few funny parts which is a shame since Donald Glover is a funny dude. I only watched four episodes and I am done with the series since I am not really into Rom Com series. If you like them then you should really check this series out.

The movie starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is not one of my most favorite action-comedy flicks of all time but a solid piece that got some really good and fun moments, action- and comedy-wise. The show, after two episodes, already feels stale, cliched, boring, generic, redundant and so on and on, and so I quit watching the show - Mr. & Mrs. Smith got a script and production on autopilot, to much blabla just to strecht the show, everything right out of AI-wonderland or written by some bored writer.

This is not that and I have no idea why some reviewers compare them at all-that is a deep intentional show about race and class and ambition and being stuck. This is a lazy attempt of a remake. I also thought the movie was terrible but was excited to watch this adaptation! That excitement did not last. The leads are ill suited to one another and have no chemistry. Even if they did, the dialogue is wooden and mediocre. There is very little plot and no character development. Leads say random things and are constantly irritated with each other and then kiss. There is no backstory to understand their motivations and the characters go from one random event to another without deepening our understanding of them.",IMDB,Donald Glover is wasted in this role,1.0
"The series started off with promise. The first episode opening was a glimpse into what the series should have been, a battle couple fighting against the odds. The setup seems good from there, meeting the Smiths, sending them on their first mission that seems low stakes but eventually proves to be something more. This should have been the premise. They could have even kept in the arch of each mission showing different points in the relationship. But the pacing was horrible. I'm sure Amazon loved this series because most of it is two people in a room talking, so those parts would be very cheap to film. But the scenes of two people discussing ad nauseum every feeling that has ever occurred to them wears out its welcome. When the episode of the dinner date with the other Smiths came around, I thought oh, this is a weird episode but maybe they just want to show a slow night and give you that feeling before we go back to the action. But after that, we basically never get back to any action. That just is what the series is from that point forward. They could have still hit the same points they hit, but had more entertainment, less dialogue. Each episode could have been half the run time and we would have still understood what was going on without needing to hear every single thought. Some people will enjoy this deep dive into relationship minutiae, but this just feels like a worse version of Beef to me. Beef somehow has the same amount of action in a series about a small business owner and a contractor, and doesn't bore you with the dialogue.",IMDB,It could have been great,5.0

"Full disclosure, my review is after one episode; it was that bad. In the movie Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie are both spies of some sort, meet, fall in love and get married not knowing the other is a spy. In this TV version, they both apply to work at some secretive organization and are then sent to live in a home and pretend to be husband and wife.That is the plot of the series and it goes downhill from here. John Smith (Donald Glover) is so annoying I couldn't wait for the episode to end so I could watch something else. He's like a 6 year old child constantly asking dumb questions. He's like the kid that keeps asking ""Why?"" and you answer and he replies ""Why?"" And his questions are dumb. I get he's thrown together with some woman he's never met & they're supposed to be married and it would help to know a bit about her but his timing is terrible. In one scene they are in the middle of their first assignment and he's asking dumb questions via text. There's a time & place for these questions, not in the middle of an operation.Then there are the insulting shortcuts they take with reality. They do stupid stuff. Maya Erskine as 'Jane Smith' on the other hand is delightful and very likeable. Don't get me wrong, I have always liked and enjoyed Glover's work but this performance is terrible.*SPOLILER ALERT*
The couple make a delivery to a house; they walk out and are walking down the street and the house explodes. They are on a residential street and the neighbors come out to see what's going on and what do our erstwhile secret agents do? They start running down the street like two guilty people; a Black man and a Japanese woman. Who wouldn't remember those two?This is just a bad series in my opinion and I only watched one episode. Bad script, bad direction, and except for Maya Erskine, bad acting.",IMDB,Unbelievably bad,1.0
"I am sitting here quite astonished at how terrible this series is. I sure expected more from Glover. First of all the writing is really poor, there's nothing intriguing about either of the main characters, there is no story development in terms of the progression from normal people to spies, they don't behave like spies, they don't have any tradecraft, nobody knows why they would have been selected, and the entire spy businesses is completely and utterly unexplained.The series is not funny, and most of all I don't understand why Maya Erskine was cast as the female lead. She's not sexy, she's barely pretty, and it's impossible to relate to her as the seductress that they portray her to be. What does Hollywood have against casting attractive and sexy women? I know a lot of women aren't going to want to hear this but she was terribly miscast for this part, and there's no chemistry between them.I just don't get the vast majority of what this film and these filmmakers are trying to convey for me. For me this is a total failure.",IMDB,An abysmal failure of a show,2.0

I have made it through the first 4 episodes, really wanting to like it, but I just don't.The two main characters are both decently likable but have no romantic chemistry whatsoever so its really hard to take them seriously as a couple.Both characters allude to having pasts in the industry, but both act like they have no idea what they are doing when on ""missions"".The plots of each episode so far are all extremely basic and mostly very predictable.I just don't really understand what the point is of using an existing IP to tell such a bland story that brings nothing new to the table?Overall I'd say its neither good nor bad, just very, very bland. Its watchable and has some good music and interesting shots, hence giving it a somewhat passable score, but I would not waste my time watching any more of this blandness.",IMDB,What is the point?,5.0

Subsequent episodes moved a little faster, but lost some of that character interest they created in the first one. I very quickly lost any investment I had in the characters AND their missions.

"Had too much expectations when i watched the first episode. Then from 2nd episode onwards it gets extremely boring. The entire series is literally a couples therapy session. Wish they shown more detailed missions but the writers were entirely concentrating on the relationship which is not bad but it was too much and were too long. I decided to go ahead with people's reviews but watching this one was huge disappointment. I guess amazon will be renewing it for season 2.

"The show started off with promise but I never could get over the lack of chemistry between John and Jane. Frankly, I think Jane was miscast.

There are too many holes in the story and far too many implausible scenarios. I really wanted to like the series but it felt like it just got worse every episode.

Taking a non-stop action movie and stretching it out for many more hours would be excellent for distracting oneself from things you want to distract yourself from. But what is actually delivered amounts to nothing more than dull, content-less dialogue, in a love story that fails to convince. Indeed, it's not just the plot that's weak; the action scenes are dull as well. One could even argue they're the worst spies in Hollywood history, including all the comedy films in the genre. The choice of an interracial couple as representation is interesting. However, in the first episodes, we see Mr. Smith laughing and mocking a Brazilian immigrant and his accent, while in the subsequent episode in Italy, Mr. Smith only repeats: ""Per Favore.""

"Anyone remember when Hollywood used to make shows and movies with original content and stories? It seems like those days are gone and the days of remakes and checking all the right boxes has taken over everything. The thing is, is that the world doesn't really enjoy that kind of entertainment.

The giant film and tv show companies are imploding financially, yet the Hollywood machine keeps on churning out content that nobody wants to see.Mr. And Mrs. Smith the tv show is definitely no Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie film, nor does the swapped in approved actors fit the bill for a knockoff.

"First of all, I think it's great that the show doesn't just try to copy the movie. It seems like a blatant copy with the standard showbusiness trope of replacing the leads with PoC people. But luckily the show does it's own thing and leans way more into the personal story of the Smiths instead of being an action comedy.The writing is good and some of the reactions and dialogue feels authentic, but it's a very mixed bag.The main issue is that the leads just don't have the same chemistry as in the movie, so you don't really buy their passionate relationship that's falling apart. They have no history of being married and it feels like they dislike each other for two days, then fall in love for a couple of months and then begin to have issues. It's made worse by the fact that they pretty much just copy the phone conversation from the movie, where Jolie is driving in the car after they fight. It feels completely out of place in the show to the point where you're just baffled that they decided to put that in.I also have some issues with the characters. They're supposed to be good at what they do, but they keep making stupid mistakes. The comedy in the movie came from the Smiths hurting each other and both of them being competent enough to not get hurt, while in the show it's more that they just can't seem to do anything right.Overall it's was better than I expected, but it's not really something I'd recommend to my friends.",IMDB,"Pretty decent show, but it falls short",5.0
"The premise is good - a world of Mr & Mrs Smith spy pairs who execute no-questions-asked missions in exchange for a lavish lifestyle and lots of cash.The settings in the first few episodes are gorgeous and I suppose, meant to seduce us into watching some more.That's where the good stuff ends.The casting is suspect. Donald Glover must have killer representation coz Hollywood has been trying to convince us that he is talented and has leading man chops. He doesn't.In this, he and his missus are supposed to be 'Higher Risk' spies and yet he has asthma (the all-knowing, all-seeing HiHi didn't know that?), the duo's running coach might as well have been Phoebe/Friends with her awkward style, their fight choreography is unconvincing (the machete scene is a blip-blank, their fight scene near the shelves in Ep8 is cartoonish) etcNext, their naïveté as 'Higher Risk' spies. They seem to trust everyone they meet - their marks, the other Smiths. They also have no awareness of their neighbours (watch Sherlock or Elementary or any regular spy/detective stuff and the leads know who's who and what's what in their hood). And most importantly, for a pair with overhyped chemistry (for the first 3 episodes), they trust everyone else except each other. Which...results in their micro aggressions towards each other till the collapse just like that!That's why, to me, this is 10% spy and 90% watered down Marriage Story.

We didn't need to see that at all. Even Parker Posey couldn't save this steaming pile of caca. Honorable mentions for terrible acting goes to Paul Dano whose face looks like bread pudding. And what freak fest wouldn't be complete without the honorable Sarah Paulson. There is no why to why this was made. With so much talent this shows streamers are just desperate to get content they can market with ""cool"" stars. But Donald Glover has reached his expiration. RIP Mr and Mrs Smith. Bury these characters and never let them see the light of another season Amazon.",IMDB,What a waste,1.0
"This show is, almost impossibly, horrendously boring and completely unfunny. The actors have zero charisma and absolutely no chemistry between them. I figured maybe the action can save the slow bits but no. I mean the show Citadel is much better, like way better, which is amazing. The anatomy of a relationship/marriage thing is lame and psychologically obtuse. The initial premise was promising and the two main characters promised a less glossy pairing than Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie but their blandness is overwhelming. I m only through episode 3 but I can't bring myself to watch any more. I just don't care.",IMDB,Simply awful,1.0
I agree with the not so good reviews.The storyline is flat and is riddled with uninteresting characters.This is not Donald Glover's element.Most of the time I was on TikTok drowning out the bland dialogues and scenes.I'd be biased if I didn't say anything about the sex scene- but Erskine's moaning was sooo fake and forced. Bad acting to the max. I had to rewind the scene..The characters tried to act tough but failed miserably. Antagonists included.Overall the show shouldn't have been made with actors who do not belong in an action-thriller show.Who is the casting director anyway?,IMDB,NO CHEMISTRY,4.0

They lacked more action, more coherent dialogues and actions that represent that they were really trained agents, they seemed like two common clumsies, they seem more like a reality type, poor actors, they deposed them in something so bad that bad production, they spent a lot of money on something else, the first 3 made more sense.

"First off, having read more than a few of the reviews of Mr & Mrs Smith here on IMDB, let me state from the outset that I have not rated this show based on the original movie starring Pitt and Jolie as I didn't rate that movie particularly high.Secondly, my low score is not based on, or has anything to do with, the ethnicity of the two lead actors. I admire and support the many very fine non-white actors out there and their work.I found this series to be poorly written and the actors in lead roles not interesting enough to sustain my interest enough to care about the characters they were playing.The plot in fact was implausible to say the least and combined with the acting gave me little to no reason to waste any more time on this series beyond the first episode.I have mentally filed this show under ""just more rubbish that the streaming services try to pass of as entertainment"". Another example of content being more important to the streaming services than quality.Further evidence of the ongoing drive to dumb down of our society.",IMDB,Missed by that much ....... actually missed by quite a bit!,3.0
"This series revolves around a pair of assassins who, at the outset of the first episode, have been carefully screened to be qualified for their roles. These are not average joes off the street; they have particular backgrounds, and match a psychological profile that dictates they're perfect for this extreme line of work. It's a given that they'd have to think on their feet, survive impossible situations and onslaughts of countless assassins at any given time. Of course the viewer must suspend reality, as with most every modern day action series or movie, where every fight or action scene is carefully choreographed and edited such that our heroes always miraculously survive. But it only works if you believe the characters can pull it off, and I don't. Their naïveté and lack of common sense would get them caught or killed immediately. The romantic drama that develops between Mr. And Mrs. Smith makes up somewhat for how ludicrously they go about their business, but not enough to save the series.",IMDB,Assassins with zero common sense,3.0
"""'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' Falters in Balancing Performances with Flimsy Script: A Lackluster Viewing Experience"".In the much awaited television series ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"" viewers were given a tempting premise: an inside look at the lives of two killers juggling the demands of marriage and espionage. Expectations were naturally high because the notion had so much potential and the cast had given outstanding performances. But as the show progressed, it became more and more obvious that ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" fell short of its original promise, leaving viewers dissatisfied and yearning for greater depth.Making its main characters, who were assassins by trade, likeable and relatable was one of the main problems the series had. Although the actors performed admirably, the script lacked the nuance and complexity necessary to completely humanize individuals involved in ethically dubious actions. Rather than exploring the intricacies of their line of work and the ethical quandaries it poses, the show chose a shallower strategy, portraying the assassins as little more than regular people with peculiarities and eccentricities. The characters' credibility was damaged by this oversimplification, and the audience was unable to fully immerse themselves in their trip. Feeling let down and yearning for more.In conclusion, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" has some excellent performances, but the series has trouble making assassins seem like likeable protagonists. Although the actors did a great job, script is too flaccid for a series.",IMDB,The story is too sloppy to be a series.,1.0
"I exhausted myself and regretted it. I don't understand why this was created. Neither thriller, nor comedy, nor drama.Boring episode number 1, they talked to each other about everything for 40 minutes of the first episode, and in the end, Boom.. I waited 40 minutes thinking that maybe this episode would get better, that there would be action, shooting, and hand-to-hand fighting, but nothing happened. Both main characters talked nonsense for 40 minutes and nothing happened. The same thing happened in episode two, ah literally nothing. Whole 40 minutes, Stupid episode, a waste of time. In the third one, they both go to an auction to find a guy and inject him with truth serum so that the guy would publicly embarrass himself. It's just that they gave him too much and killed him, 2:1 for the agency. In the fourth episode, they meet spies just like them and invite them to their house for a party, 40 minutes of talking, no action. Then they sent them by helicopter from New York to somewhere in the Caribbean (how childish) to deliver a package, in the last 5 minutes of the episode the package is delivered and things don't go as planned, so they kill the bad guys and go back to New York by helicopter. A shallow plot, with no action, and little humor, the worst thing is that you keep waiting for something to happen and nothing happens, the worst is episode 4, nothing happened.I'm wondering if I should watch the next one, what a low-budget series, they try to make up for the lack of action with a bit of sex, but they don't show anything. Zero breast. So no humor, no sex, boring and endless narration for 40 minutes in episodes with nothing happening. DON'T WATCH, it's a waste of time.",IMDB,Don't waste your time,1.0
"Love Donald Glover from Community but do not understand casting of Myra Erskine. This was potentially a prime role for a myriad of actresses, yet I can not understand the complete swing/miss on ""Mrs. Smith"".The Initial suspicion of the protagonist partner is understandable, but the sudden ""hookup"" is jarring and inexplicable.The role of ""Mrs Smith"" should be an alluring femme fatale. Ms. Ersine is best cast as protagonist friend/co-worker but not a ""risk your life"" love object to base a series on.I had high hopes based upon the original movie and I truly wanted to like this reboot but after 2 episodes will not be back.",IMDB,Zero Chemistry,1.0

What transpires is one long drawn out dialogue heavy series of scenarios which are not helped by the wooden acting of the characters (especially the male lead).It is such a shame the original film was an enjoyable spy romp with two big characters that bounced off each other, this in trying to be different has failed miserably.",IMDB,Such a let down,4.0

The parts that are supposed to be funny aren't. The parts that are supposed to be suspenseful aren't. The parts that are supposed to be romantic aren't.

Jane was your a-typical feminist that can do anything better that you. In a small unrealistic package. They even had a scene where Parker Posey (another Jane) beats Donald Glovers character in arm wrestling..... it's just unrealistic and not believable at all. Back to Jane who is constantly degrading every form of masculinity that John (Donald) has. He can't do anything right. She even makes fun of him for loving his mom to much. While she's just a sad nobody herself.

The toxicness of their relationship can be boiled down to John making some mistakes and Jane treating him like a worthless idiot whenever he does. This they fight over a lot.The show should have ended with them either breaking up or Jane resolving to not be so judgy. Instead Jane caves and says she will have children with John, knowing this will keep him in the relationship, despite her ongoing emotional abuse.

"When I saw this on my Amazon Prime, I thought hmmm... I liked the Mr & Mrs Smith film, it was fab, the music was great, there was a fun premise between two rival assassins and they didn't know until much later.This could have been good, even if the premise had to shift. In the first episode there is a bit of team building where they are given a mission to get a package to a location. This package turns out to be a cake and they don't think much of it, like it could have been a simple test to make sure they are agent material. The cake explodes killing 9 people and then it feels like we are moving into the right territory.But there's a problem. Maya Erskine and Don Glover don't work. Maya Erskine especially sucks the emotion out of the room by being a cold fish. I feel like Don Glover is actually trying but I'm not sure with Maya Erskine and because this all hinges on them being a couple, it doesn't keep me engaged.The original Mr & Mrs Smith had guile, pizzazz and class. This feels like somewhat of a void of a TV show. I had an inkling this was going to be a bust when I saw all 8 episodes launched in binge format. I know it's not going to be great when delivered that way.Could we have had the Mr & Mrs Smith with Parker Posey and Wagner Moura instead? (credited as other Jane and other John). I would have watched that. Sadly not. I wish Amazon would actually pay better attention when making these, or vetting them.

"Tv Series '' Mr. And Mrs. Smith '' is a ''remake'' of the 2005 movie with the same title and the similarities end here. The series is more of a ''Scenes of the marriage'' rather than a spy movie, though there are some action scenes and each episode is dedicated to a different case.However, there are a lot of things that play off camera and it is not easy to piece things together. The pace didn't aid at all to it, as the relationship between the two leads go from total stranger to I love Yous in just an episode.

However, that movie ended up mildly entertaining because of the charisma and chemistry between the two leads (and that it didn't take itself very seriously).This series however runs out of charm and steam in the first 20 minutes, once the premise is out.

"It just doesn't work. Ill start with the negatives. To call this a comedy is a stretch to say the least, it isn't really an action series either, it falls more into the offbeat drama category. The episodes are slow and there's little to no plot in each. The series comes to rely and focus on the relationship between the two main characters. This is where it really fails, neither of them are likeable and more importantly, interesting. I honestly don't care about either of them or what happens to them. This isnt helped by the predictability of their character development. Falling in love, rubbing each other up the wrong way followed by loathing. Donald Glover is a capable and versatile actor but I didn't enjoy him in this at all. I didn't find him remotely believeable as a CIA agent.Some positives, there are moments of great acting from both main actors. Visually, its very well shot and the location shots are nice treat.

First few seconds lol ""Brad"" Smith endearingly brings up that squirrel! After that? All downhill. These are two dull characters badly acted out, rejects from other programs, but not for anything cool lol simply for being defective...

"I am a big fan of Donald Glover's music and his show 'Atlanta'. I was a bit skeptical about his role in this show, but I decided to give it a chance... and it ended up being a total bore. It has also been a long time since I saw the original Mr. & Mrs. Smith movie, so I was not really comparing this show to anything in my head.The first few episodes are entertaining as we are learning about the characters, what their job entails, and how they will work together. However, the latter half of the show is a slog. This is a problem I find that a lot of streaming shows have- they try desperately to stretch out multiple episodes with runtime to 40-60 min when, most of the time it isn't necessary. There is hardly any action in the latter half of the show, and when there is, it's nothing special. It's just one tedious conversation after another with some shooting and explosions in between.I was also disappointed in Glover's performance as, for the last several years, he cannot seem to play any other character but himself. He is always just a monotone guy who is a little bit nerdy but also suave. There are even moments in this show when he discussed a few musical artists- WHY WOULD HE BE DOING THIS? His character has mentioned nothing about music before, so why bring it up? We know you are a musician, Glover, but that is not who THIS character is. Come on.The final episode is in itself a total letdown too. The pacing is all over the place and the characters do and say so many things that don't make sense. There were so many opportunities for them to wrap up things in a clever way, but then the writers didn't do anything with it. To add insult to injury, there was a PAINFULLY long sequence where Glover and Erskine take drugs to be honest with one another and it was just really, really stupid and contrived. It reminded me a lot about the ending of the show 'Beef', which I also thought was terrible for similar reasons. I know the rich and famous in Hollywood are disconnected from reality and are probably just used to tripping instead of actually connecting with people, but this is a trope that needs to be nipped in the bud. It's not relatable nor funny nor good writing.I might have gone easier on this show, but that last episode just set me over the edge. The only reason why it's getting 2 stars instead of 1 is for cinematography and the decent first couple episodes. I would suggest maybe just watching for those, otherwise, you can skip this one.",IMDB,Disappointing,2.0

And how do the two of them avoid getting shot or injured by about 50 bad guys? And they fell hopelessly in love after maybe a week?

We had McDonald style movies that did their job, like Twister, and Mr& Ms Smith. Wasn't great, but hit the spot.In 2020+, we can't even have that.

Thanks to other reviewers for hinting at that.I'm not an expert, but the acting seemed pretty good to me.However, I quite couldn't get attached to the characters or the situations they find themselves in.The characters evolve from a cold working relationship to being madly in love, then to hating each other, and suddenly they're discussing having babies with barely any transitions shown. I think I 'rationally' understand it: quite a bit of time passes between episodes, and relationships develop off-screen. But understanding that doesn't mean I connect with their evolution.Even in the last episode, there's a gunfight that somehow goes to show the whole problem: they go from trying to kill each other to not really, to hating each other, to loving each other with no clear transition or reason.Plus: the show ends on a massive cliffhanger, and I'm getting really tired of that.",IMDB,"Some goods, a lot of bads",4.0
"Hard to say what show, if any, the 8+ reviewers watched. Maybe there was a special release that they saw where it was edited with a lot more funny scenes and the story made sense. What I've been watching is a dumpster fire.When you name a series after a movie it is assumed there will be some kind of linkage to the movie. The series ""The Continental"" is expected to have some linkage to the John Wick series. If it is about a low end hotel in the bad part of town with John Clease as the manager then it would be a disappointment. Even if Clease gave the comedic performance of his life.Now, onto the other implied expectation in the reviews and postings. That this is a comedy. No. It is not. There is nothing remotely funny about this show. There are no buildups to jokes that execute and make you laugh. At no point does tension build and suddenly something funny happens and you laugh at how your expectations were subverted. The charachters don't even quip. They are like two uncomfortable strangers with nothing in common trying to have a conversation on a 22 hour flight to New Zealand where one of th has a 1 hour layover while the other is on a 2 week vacation. Nothing at all in common and nothing funny from the situation.I don't care that they traded the two attractive and sexy leads for two moderately attractive actors who can't create the least amount of sexual tension much less the impression of romance. Screaming that bigots are down voting this is total BS.The show simply sucks. Nothing more, nothing less. It's another in a pointless parade of garbage on the streaming services. Content for contents sake. Watch it if you want. Some people like this kind of garbage, you might be that kind of person.",IMDB,Most of the 8+ reviews are trashing on the 4- reviews.,1.0
"First off I love Donald Glover. The man oozes talent. Secondly I, like everyone else loved Mr & Mrs Smith! So how could combining the two result in this? Half way through episode 1 I wanted to hide my eyes. By the end my family & I was so grateful that it was over there was an audible sigh of relief. There is zero chemistry between the characters. Furthermore how are we supposed to care about their personal lives when we just met them? Yet their awkward personal banter went on and on. If we didn't dislike the characters enough we see them excitedly laughing at the realization that they had murdered several innocent laborers who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.",IMDB,How could it be so bad?,3.0
"Movie turned tv series doesnt work unless you have some sort of hook like great dialog, interesting stories and characters, or just interesting subject. This has none of those. It formulaic and simply failed to sow any interest in anything. The original movies were only interesting because of the humor but you can only do that so many times before it gets old. That is all they have here and after episode 2, it became repetitive.So where to start? I just dont like the characters. They are not intelligent nor are they very funny. They are just generic Jane and John, following orders, and trying to figure out what marriage is supposed to be and failing. They are both extremely mopey. Every episode has them whining about something and some episodes (the therapist arc was unwatchable), were all about their feelings... It was tiring to watch.The stories are largely an after thought. Its a bunch of disjoint missions where they go kill someone or protect them or whatever. It plays like generic quests in a video game. None of them really matter and are just plot points to feed us more interpersonal drama. The only recurring theme is they run into other Janes and Johns but this didnt result in anything interesting. Just more of the same.The action in this show is largely not great. Again, its mostly about the interpersonal drama rather than an action adventure. The plots are there just to help the two main characters ""bond"" for lack of better word. In one episode, they didnt even bother playing out the action. They just went to a cut and we came back at the end after they fought everyone and won. No problem if the drama was interesting but its not.Its a very average show written to be as generic as the main character's names. They should have stuck to 1.5-2hr movies.",IMDB,Waaaaaay too long,4.0
"Okay I really waited for this when I saw the title it immediately took to back in time to the Mr and Mrs Smith movie was so good and here I thought it was going to be like the movie well it is not!! It is so slow and flat oh my God they should have stuck with the movie concept I felt like the only good thing here was Alexander Skarsgard who only had a cameo it is hilarious really! I just wish they stuck to the movie idea, this was not good at all. I have great respect for Donald Glover but this is a pass for me. I did not even go past the third episode because I couldn't stand it geez. Hollywood what is happening these days mmh?!",IMDB,Should Have Stuck To The Movie!!,3.0
"Worse than the movie! Will never recommend! It had good promise, but fails to deliver on the action! It doesn't even have good writing let alone the acting! I am so glad they never put in seasoned actors!I hope it doesn't go to season two! It is sad romance/comedy that's not even funny! The last show is just bad writing! The actors can only be good as the writing! The characters make you want to kill them just to get to the end.I can't even laugh at the end because it was so stupid! American television has really gone down the tubes in recent years and this show just proves it even more! I watched but will never watch it again or even recommend it.",IMDB,Sad rom/com,1.0
"I say sad because it feels like so much of modern television is trying to manipulate us into normalizing abnormal situations and the abnormal reactions of people to those situations, which, given the context of the world today I believe, is unhealthy and has actually contributed to what is a very unhealthy sociopolitical situation in our society. The characters in this show have agreed to be hitmen. As an audience we don't know if they're working for the ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" but what we do know is that they're quite willing to kill people for money and have no qualms about doing so. Overlaid on top of this is the ""meet cute"" of a romcom juxtaposed against all of the murderous and antisocial behaviour that they display in carrying out their sociopathic work. As an audience, we are asked to see this as normal. They're just a ""normal"" we're having trouble adjusting to working together and living together and determining whether or not they want to or don't want to have children like this is just just, a normal suburban couple with normal suburban problems, which happened to be that they're under a lot of stress, because they go out and murder people all the time. I think the show is well produced, but of course, everyone is upper middle-class (look at the clothes, look at the furniture look at the house) which, of course is calculated to help North American audiences understand this situation as normal. I think the acting is perfectly acceptable, and I like both of the actors and how they are performing the starring roles. But most importantly, I think that this show is terrible and it's sad that it is presenting a world in which we accept as normal, that people are so completely sociopathic that they are willing to do anything to have these beautiful clothes, this high-end furniture, and this custom home that they will kill indiscriminately, and without question anyone that they contractually aimed at killing. If you want to know why people today have a problem, figuring out what's real and what's the truth , this show and the history of shows like it that have let us here. Dexter is probably an example is exactly why North American society in North American politics is so f'd up. It's truly sad.",IMDB,Sad,2.0
"This was very poor in acting, direction and 'comedy'.i actually think it needs a totally new team involved, or bin it. Some of the stunts and effects would indicate a decent budget, which makes the results even worse. A couple of the actors do an OK job, but come across badly because of the dialogue and direction.Really trying to find some positives in it to be fair, and I have definitely seen worse (not much), but not sure why Amazon green lit this and gave it so much money. There are a hundred TV series in the past that worked with similar dynamics, just done in a much more effective way. I would save time in your life and avoid.",IMDB,"I gave it a two/three, but that was being kind",2.0
"This show was a solid 6 for me before episode 6. It had ok-ish acting, interesting (but unrealistic) concept and some genuinely funny moments.Boxes need to be ticked these days in Hollywood for a tv show to even get the green light to be made. So I understand that and that is fine with me. These days if you want to watch anything better than a 6 you need to watch foreign or old movie.That said, I went in with low expectations and was genuinely surprised how funny it was in some parts. However, the show gets progressively worse with each episodr until it gets to episode 6 when it turns into a full-on couple's therapy and you feel like you're watching an episode of Jerry Springer show and that is exactly where I decided to quit watching.A wasted potential.",IMDB,Full nose dive from episode 6,1.0

"So many amazing scenes and amazing effect work. Characters and acting seem fine to me. The quality of camera and sets are top notch. My only complaint is it is SLOW. I mean it seems like one 5 minute action scene every episode and the rest is dialog or random mind games with each other. Even my better half wife stated it's not a love story either. It flashes greatness but at the end of the day if falls flat IMO of what it could be. If you expected the movie, the storyline is there just different people.

"I guess the comedy is in two agents lacking in skill as regards spycraft or relevant information to do their job while being more interested in getting to know one another than doing the job (at least from the first few episodes)There are better spy based stories out there.But if you want drama in a ""spy"" series, I guess you could do worse.This just left me flat.Everything they do is seemingly inconsistent with ""spycraft"", from constantly looking around while watching the target, to running away in public, failure to communicate and getting emotionally attached at the drop of a hat, distracting them from their job.The chemistry feels forced, perhaps by the end of the season it will fit better, but the first few episodes it feels they are doing things because the story needs them to do things.",IMDB,Secret organisation hires untrained agents,3.0
"This series is terrible, save yourself hours of your life. I gave it 5 episodes hoping it would improve, joke was on me.The characters are full, their interactions with each other and others are cringy, awkward, boring, and very unrealistic. The premise itself is dumb, the missions, how they were selected, the company giving as few details about a mission as possible. Makes total sense.Episode 5 has a chase a shoot scene with is ridiculous. Never seen so many missed shots in all my life. And the convenience of their safe house is laughable.

"I certainly never expected this to be similar to the movie and thankfully it's not. It's something else; a poorly written pastiche led by two remarkably dull and uninteresting characters who struggle to do their job, talk incessantly about themselves and have no chemistry whatsoever. I've watched the first three episodes all of which were poorly written and, even worse, remarkably boring. It's generally accepted that a series can start badly and pick up later on and that might happen with this one but, for me, potentially wasting another hour in the hope that it'll all turn out to be an exciting romp through spyland is enough to call it quits.",IMDB,Something else,5.0
"I hate reviews, mainly because reviews are like beauty, it's in the eye of the beholder. If you're looking for this to be like the movie, look elsewhere. It does have elements from the movie but not many. The concept for this show is awesome. However the chemistry between the 2 main actors is pretty much nonexistent. Being that the premise is 2 strangers thrown together in a sham marriage, you expect a certain amount of awkwardness. Then they find their stride and everything is great. No it just feels akward and forced all the time, like putting 2 people who hate each other in the same room and say act like you're in love. The actors don't do anything to make you like or dislike the characters. I just couldn't connect to the characters good or bad.",IMDB,Lacking chemistry. Just blah,3.0
"A remarkable disaster with little going for it other than some laughs and cameos of actors that were okay. This is 85% dialogue and 15% action, making it an all boring affair.Sadly it jist wasn't believable in that they would be picked as agents, they come across as so naive and adolescent. Who would seriously have hired them, whatever organisation hired them did not carry out enough background checks, in nearly all situations John/Jane they were pretty useless. They were told to leave there old lives but that clearly didn't happen, what sort of organisation is this that hired them?The conversations between the pair were bizarre, I can't tell if the direction and chemistry between Jane and John was to either make them connected or not, the acting felt forced either way and didn't deliver a conclusion or any character progression. I couldnt feel any connection with the characters, so I didn't care what happend to them.In fact there was far to much talking, it slowed everything down, for example ep6 with the therapist was totally pointless and added nothing and neither did John's mother turning up announced at their house right before they start shooting at each other.There were plot holes with some of the missions for example ep1 where was the cake lady going with the cake/bomb. In nearly each mission thee was little reasonsing provided to viewers why John/Jane were doing what they were asked to. The info given for missions was so vague it was no wonder they failed 3 of them.Pretty poor effort really.

"Truthfully, honestly. This show is a joke!. I could barely stand watching the first episode!. I prefer the 2005 movie, cause it had a real & moving story/plotline. The show didn't have any of that! Seriously, two complete strangers with barely any field experiences, thrown together in an arranged marriage by the agency and tossed into missions. It didn't work for me. Truthfully, the only reason why I wanted to watch the show in the first place, is my most favorite girl ever!... Eiza Gonzalez!. She was wonderful as her character, called the ""other Jane"". I don't care what anybody else says, but eiza's character & her on screen husband the ""other john"" were the real Mr. & Mrs. Smith! They had a real true love for each other. They were 100% intriguing & engaging. They were the real driving force of the whole completely better story/plotline!. The great news is, it was one of eiza's greatest & memorable performances so far. She truly made ""other Jane"" 100% beautiful, hardcore, outside of the box & wonderful. The bad news, it went downhill severely after her character & the ""other john"" were killed within 4 & 1/2 minutes later. Then they lost me after that. Eiza & her character deserves better treatment then that! At least, eiza's Jane went down fighting.She truly owned & drove the show & moment from the very first second!.I give the show a 4/10, but I give eiza gonzalez and her co star (Alexander skarsgard) 10/10.

"Watch the movie.Oof this one is a misfire for a couple of reasons.1. The couple played by Glover and Erskin should work, they are both talented and charismatic historically but limited dialogue and deadpan delivery throughout the 8 episodes makes it seem more like two lazy, socially inept people get together out of convenience rather than having legitimate chemistry. Compounding the problem we are given almost no information on the two characters until much much later (and still not much) which makes all of their interactions seem two dimensional.2. It was a mistake to have this marketed as having anything to do with espionage, spycraft, or even intelligent action. The two main characters almost always behave exactly the opposite of what common sense would dictate... trying to get away from an explosion? Run down the center of the street through traffic as fast as you can. In a remote ski lodge during a blizzard trying to observe only? Kill a bunch of people after you get identified by your targets. Asked to be discreet on a mission? Leave through the front door with your target incapacitated while leaving a checked article of clothing behind. And of course being a covert operative requires being inconspicuous and hard to locate so naturally... live in a 15 million dollar brown stone. Well at least they are super skilled at what they get paid to do... no not at all, in any way.3. Complete absence of consequences. Nothing and I mean nothing that happens seems to matter. Not the mess ups, not the mistakes or public spectacles, it just happens and never seems to matter, the episode just ends with bland dialogue regarding how the two character suddenly love each other. Non of the details seem to be anything but red herrings.4. Incredible guest appearances that are mainly wasted on simple and quick mission fodder never to be seen again.5. Locations, cinematography, editing along with the general production quality is very good! In some ways this makes the show even more frustrating as all the skill involved is wasted.6. From episode to episode the narrative isn't moved forward instead each episode serves as a glimpse into each mission. It's obvious that it's in an effort to expedite the passage of time to focus on the missions but 4 hours in and there is still very little development of story, characters, or context to any of the events that have happened. This makes it very hard to care about.TLDR; A cold mess rightfully discarded into the past.",IMDB,Compelled me to...,3.0

"Series shouldn't have taken it's name from the Brangelina movie but that's entirely beside the point.I love Donald glover. I liked the couple/spy premise. But boy is this hard to watch.There is a veneer of spy thriller here. A very thin one. And the comedy element is so much thinner I was literally surprised to see in the synopsis, after watching the first two episodes, the word ""comedy.""Ninety plus percent of this movie is just palpably weird melodrama between the two a la their cover as a couple. I can't tell if it supposed to be funny or darkly funny or just sink or swim acclimation. The strangers having to pretend to be a couple and warming to each other has been done to death and frequently done well. But it isn't here.John just can't seem to wrap his head around the idea that the marriage is a pretense between strangers. He is weirdly and continually trying to make it real. He's like the pitiful theater kid that gets to play Romeo opposite a high school idol and Absolutely. Can. Not. Get over it. And just be cool and professional. And that's a generous comparison vs the coworker or boss who behaves the same with less reason for pretense.Given the premise, virtually everything he does is invasive, presumptive, wildly inappropriate and overtly unreciprocated but he just keeps going. Simply cannot make an appropriate, normal, socialized-human comment.His obsessiveness isn't supposed to taken as creepy according to the writing. He is a deep guy who loves his mother. They try to make his bizarreness seem normal by hitting the bell over and over that Jane is afraid of connection/commitment and whatever. But GD who wouldn't recoil from this guy's clueless attentions. I haven't felt so viscerally creeped out by someone that is supposed to be the good guy protagonist since Passengers.Jane is also weird. But given the writing it's really hard to read her weirdness as anything other than self-preservation in light of being stuck with an unstable stalker.And from this context 90+ percent of the dialogue and situations are generated. They just keep insisting harder and harder there is chemistry between them (quite apart from insisting they are semi-competent agents) while making it harder and harder to buy apart from Stockholm syndrome or similar explanations.",IMDB,Obviously it's not the A-lister B-movie.

"I watched the first episode of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, a spy comedy starring Donald Glover and Maya Erskine, and I was very disappointed. The show was dull, predictable, and tedious, unlike the 2005 film that inspired it, which was fun and thrilling.Glover and Erskine are wasted in serious roles that do not match their comedic talents. The action scenes are boring and unoriginal, and the humor is scarce and forced.Some critics and audiences liked the show, but I did not. I gave it 3 out of 10 on IMDb, and I do not recommend it to spy comedy fans.I expected more from Glover and Erskine, who have shown their skills in their previous roles. They have such elastic expressions, it can feel like a waste to see them so still and serious all the time. The show tries to be an intellectual commentary on marriage, but it ends up being a bland and repetitive story.The original film had a completely different dynamic and a much better chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who played the titular characters.The film was not boring at all, but rather a fun and thrilling ride that balanced action and comedy.

"Let's get this out front straight away this is a TV show about an arranged marriage first and foremost that just so happens to be with two wannabe spies / assassins. It could easily be about two accountants or chefs that work together as the spy work is sparsely dotted around each episode.It does add a small amount of tension in the fact that they HAVE to make it work or consequences.Here's a deep dive into the first episode (Spoilers)
The show's opening scene starts with a bang with Alexander Skarsgård and Úrsula Corberó who after deciding not to continue running from the unknown assailants decide to stay and fight for their freedom. Bish, bash, bosh they're dead.Wow, cool cold opening but it's not actually a cold opening it's just a hook. In a not too subtle way for the show to say whatever fond memories you had of the movie (or even the criminally short run from Scott Bakula and Maria Bello in 1996) we just dumped all that in the trash and this is our story now.Okay, I thought take me on a journey.We cut to Maya Erskine enrolling in a secret organisation via a kiosk in a sparse office building then ditto for Donald Glover.They are both accepted and assigned to the same house and well lookie here, they are married and renamed Mr & Mrs Smith.From here on in any resemblance to previous Mr & Mrs Smith outings are well and truly left behind but no worries I thought I never bring any expectations with me because it's up to you the writers, cast, director etc... to take me with you on the story you want to tell.Some chit chat happens as it does with strangers and then they get their first mission via scrolling text messages. I am asking myself why would texts scroll and why is Mrs Smith reading them aloud as they can both see the laptop. The mission is to 'intercept a package immediately' from a mysterious lady.This is all happening during the day because it's still sunny outside and the text message says 11:47.They are given details of where she will be at 12pm (13 minutes away) and a specific restaurant in NYC along with drop off co-ordinates strangely in latitude and longitude but it's actually in the 200 meters out in the Hudson River (I looked it up). Why not just an address, ooh because it sounds spyish, I don't know. There's also an instruction to 'sit near bar', er why? Doesn't matter and I still don't know.Quick better get a move on the last text was received at 11:48 only 12 minutes from now.Er no. They mooch around the house for a while do some yoga, cooking and eating. He sees unwashed dishes in the sink setting up a pet peeve to be revealed later. Can't wait for that pay off (ah sigh).Donald Glover shows off some man boobs just because and an awkward conversation follows.So the text message was not for today but another day, I can only assume it's for the next day but if these are the instructions from their boss it can only end in failure every time.The next day arrives and we have the restaurant scene, inane chit chat and some personal stories and details for 5 minutes while looking very suspicious, with constant head turning to look at the mysterious lady and not sitting near the bar. They follow the lady to a nearby park and 5 more minutes of inane chit chat goes on while they are watching from a park bench again looking very suspicious, with constant head turning to look at the mysterious lady (oh I said that already but it happens).Then there's 8 minutes of running after the lady to eventually do a bump switcharoo, the box falls to ground and is swapped. The mysterious lady immediately realises the box has been switched while turning it over and over in her hands and then does nothing. Box in hand we are now on the train to deliver it to the specified location. It's delivered to a house that is about to hold a shindig or some social event and the parcel is opened in front of them. It's just an innocuous cake for the event taking place later but hold on viewers it's really a bomb and it explodes Joker style as they're leaving blasting out a small portion of the side of this huge house and throwing them to the ground.They run away causing people to notice them, they continue to run from the suburbs back into the city in mere moments and through busy streets and shops for no real reason rather than just walk. Not sure why, I think that the writers have played too many computer games (Red Dead Redemption or GTA) where if you hear a Marshall or police sirens then the NPCs will automatically and relentlessly hone in on your location.Hiding in an alleyway with only some dust on them and a small cut on Mr Smith's hand (which I didn't notice) Mrs Smith hatches a cunning plan from the cunning plan bag of Baldrick. She does not think to pat each other down to get rid of the dust and wipe their faces off and walk off, oh no too simple. She covers her face in Mr Smith's blood and he carries her into the back of an Asian restaurant screaming incoherently. As Mrs Smith is screaming in pain an NPC cook shouts 'I'll go for help' and runs out the back door. Not sure why he does this as the door leads back into the empty alleyway, maybe there's a payphone round the corner. I'm pretty sure all restaurants have phones. The other NPC staff just flap their arms around doing nothing in particular. They enter the restaurant restroom and I imagine all the NPCs do what NPCs do when the protagonist is not in the line of sight; they carry on doing what they were doing before as though nothing has happened.Wanted level has dropped to 1 star.They split up and meet back at their house and have a little talk and open up a little.END OF EPISODE 1Well so far it wasn't terrible but the next seven episodes withered away along with my focused interest into an exploration of how an arranged marriage can evolve or devolve between two socially awkward and dysfunctional people. It meanders from social exchange theory to social penetration theory even to the point where one episode is just therapy session after therapy session.After digesting the first episode it began to dawn on me that this show was not going to be that coherent.And here was my main reasoning taken from episode 1.A huge, all powerful organisation wants someone dead, fine. Could they not supply the cake bomb rather than having to steal it? Okay so maybe the target would recognise that the cake was not the same one as she had chosen. Not a problem, they took the wrong cake and they could make their apologies and let the target keep the cake and pretend to go and come back with the correct one. What was the mysterious lady doing with the cake bomb in the first place? This seems like an interesting subplot. Did they save her life, did she know it was a bomb, did she know it was a cake? Was there another target? Where was she taking the cake / bomb, who knows? After the swap why would she turn a cake over and over in her hands to identify that it's not the same package with a cake in it?This mission took at least 18 minutes to get the cake bomb from the lady then probably even longer to get to the drop off location in the suburbs as they took the train all for the bomb to be on a timer. If it wasn't on a timer why didn't the triggerman wait a few more minutes to let Mr & Mrs Smith get a block or two away?As mentioned it was a very large house, the intended target might have gone to the garden to oversee caterers, rearrange chairs or have a smoke. If they completed the mission as instructed 'immediately' then even more time would have elapsed after delivery for the target to not be near the cake bomb.As my title says the spy stuff has been thrown on haphazardly like glitter from a child's hand.Can Donald Glover carry a TV show or film? In my opinion, no. As likable as he is as a person in real life his charms fall flat on screen and lacks real passion in the emotional scenes. He's just a cool dude.Could Maya Erskine carry a TV show or film, yes and without her on the show this would have been a total disaster. She's an intriguing actress with an even brighter future. I am sure if Phoebe Waller Bridge was the female lead it would have been a very different show and possibly/probably not for the better.Did I find it illuminating or entertaining, No, not really.Did I find it mildly intriguing? Yes.Were there any redeeming qualities from this show? Yes, Maya was solid and carried the show for what it's worth, the cinematography was really good but with the ending as it was it just turned the whole season into content.With studios nowadays just dipping their feet into TV shows and not committing we are always left with show directors and writers begging for season 2 to be picked up with vague or loose endings rather than actually telling a story to its final conclusion come what may.Fargo does this with aplomb.Will I be watching season 2 if there is one? Probably not because if there is a second season I would have the answer to the cliff-hanger already.If there is a season 2 I would expect the same actors to come back but then where would the relationship drama come from now they have committed to each other or if the writers were really bold they could start again with another two Mr & Mrs Smiths but that won't happen.If you want to see something about arranged marriages then I highly recommend watching Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) with the legendary Shah Rukh Khan, if you want to watch a spy film then I recommend The Spy How Came In From The Cold and if it's a good old 90's Spy TV show than the original with Scott Bakula and Maria Bello is fun and free on YouTube or Chuck which is fun and stupid.If you like relationship shows and Maya Erskine then I can also recommend Man Seeking Woman.Even now I can't say that I liked or disliked this show and I know why some people will hate or love it but for me it did nothing. It will fall out of my memory like a runny egg from a plate.",IMDB,8hrs of meandering analysis of an arranged marriage with some spy glitter spilt on it (not decoratively).,5.0
"I get that this is different from the movie and so on. Its a series it can be dull sometimes but this it hard to watch.If it only said drama then its fine, but when you call it action, comedy then you think it supposed to be funny.The chemistry between the two main characters is not there. Feels like a series about two depressed people in a social experiment.Action is there periodically but mostly not, unless action for you is two people talking a lot, and talking to others when not talking to each other.Like someone wrote in one of the previous comments, Fubar is a action comedy show thats really entertaining, and Fubar is not great but its gold in comparison in ways of commedy and action.",IMDB,Where is the comedy?,1.0

"I was definitely not expecting anything like the movie. And yep, it isn't.But having seen the trailers and a lot of reviews, i was expecting something very good.It is really slow. Very contrived. The acting is good, but they don't have much to work with. Story lines are simple. There's not much depth to the characters, or the missions, or anything. There are lots of gaps and pieces of stories that just don't fit.It's billed as witty - there's perhaps one or two amusing bits in each episode, but hardly witty.There were so many opportunities to make episodes more exciting, more in depth, more engaging, more witty. It's missed the mark in all of these areas.One wonders why so much effort went into this (picking great actors, some scenes are really well out together) yet the choice to run it as a slow paced series gives the impression it's only done to make money rather than to entertain.Perhaps I've missed some nuance. Are there hidden messages? Are there references to other movies or events, that I'm not tuned into? Is it because I've spent too much time watching mainstream TV and this is deliberately slow, eclectic and disjointed, to cater to a more 'refined' audience?Some people absolutely love this and best of luck to them.

"A reasonably promising concept with good actors. However the writing is simply terrible with so much focus on trivial boring aspects that I found it very hard to concentrate on an entire episode. Before long I'd be looking at my feet, wondering what tomorrow will bring and not watching the programme at all. However, I though that as I had invested in a couple of episodes I'll try a few more. Unfortunately it only gets more tedious. If you make it past the exceptionally dull episode six then you're a more tolerant person that I am.

"Though I watch the entire first season, I wish I hadn't. The amount of drama between these two main characters was just over the top. I went from liking both of them to absolutely despising them. I loved Donald Glover in Atlanta, but if his future work is like this series, I will pass. The main lead Maia, was intriguing at first. But after a while, I could not bear her overbearing personality, and all the innuendos that went on with it. One episode of the fighting and marital strife would have sufficed, with more episodes, focused on interesting missions that seem to be the background for Marital discord. The ending of the season is so unsatisfying, you'd hope that there would be some sort of conclusion. But clearly the creators felt so confident in their work that they would leave everyone completely hanging expecting they would come back for more of the same drivel . I can't promise you I won't watch out of morbid curiosity, but I hope to avoid the second season.",IMDB,Loathsome couple,3.0
"Will start by stating that I did watch the movie with the same name and that is not the reason that made me watch this show. The main reason being that I love Thrillers/Spy/Crime shows.I have watched 4 episodes till this review, hope the rest are better.That being said, this show is listed as Drama&Thriller, but is indeed a Drama, Romance, Comedy with some Action.There is too much back&forth useless nonsense and too much damn romance.When there's actually some action, it fails miserably short and sometimes they cut it to another scene and you actually have to guess what happened. Like with a fight in the Italian ski thingy.Also they made both characters dumb as hell most of the time.Want to see some good spy stuff with Drama/Thriller/Comedy/Action with amazing acting?

"I see Alexander Skaarsgard in the first scene and become instantly excited. Then I learn that he is supposed to be the Brad Pitt Smith, coupled with an equally good-looking Angelina Jolie Smith version. The show immediately goes downhill from there, introducing a new Smith couple with zero chemistry and charisma that I begin to wonder what is the point of all this. The plot lines are intriguing enough, but for a show heavily dependent on the relationship of its leads, it is severely lacking in any form of appeal. The crux of the problem I am afraid to say is the actress playing Mrs. Smith. Granted she is portrayed as a plain Jane in this 2024 version, not even remotely close to the God-like beauty of Angelin Jolie, we expect to see some refreshing charm and humor, both of which she lacks. If the show is opting for a clever, firecracker version of Mrs. Smith, Akwafina would have made a better choice.",IMDB,The opening scene is a tease,3.0
"This show first and biggest sin is the one we been seeing more and more since streaming services became so prominent. These services need to add content to retain audience(subscriptions) and they count their stats in watch time, so an 8 to 10 episodes show is great for that.The issue is, these shows often have very little plot or evolution and just drag and drag to fill the gap. If you cut all the fluff and padding, usually you could have a 2h/2h30 fine movie. Disney been guilty of this with their Marvel shows and this one also is.Now on the show itself. The second sin for me is the lack of spy stuff or even action. 80% of the show is dedicated to their relationship and bickering. If some jokes and dialogues DO LAND, a lot do not and if you want fun spy stuff, you get so very few of it.Of all their ""missions"", maybe one was slightly interesting to follow and the others felt more like a context to have the dialogues kinda like a sitcom will have a random situation every episodes just to give context to the jokes.I also have to adress the cast obviously since its been something peoples talked a lot about. In the first episode you got Eiza Gonzalez in a cameo. I don't know if her and her ""John"" are suppose to be Brad and Angelina from the movie or not, but i think Eiza would had been a much better casting choice for Jane than Maya Erskine.If Donald Glover would be consider fairly attractive and fit, Maya seem a lot more ""blend"" and average. It would be fine if the show didn't often try to present her as this super attractive beauty. It made it harder to get into the characters.The show also has a weird structure with several time gap between certain episodes while others seem to happen back to back. As another review mentioned, i also backed out of an episode a few times to made sure i didn't skip one by mistakes.Ultimately the show just simply ""bored"" me. Exept the last 2 episodes because i wanted to get it over with (and obviously was expecting more action for the final) i couldn't watch more than 1 at a time and pretty much forced myself to finish it because its only 8 episodes.Alias from the 90s was a better spy show and i had more fun in recent years with the True Lies show despite this one also having its flaws. I felt it embrassed its silly side with better jokes while still having its share of action. This one tried to be serious and grounded while also having some wonky situation and elements that felt completely out of place. It made for a weird mix.I'm not even sure if i will watch Season 2 if there is one. Maybe if bored since its on Prime video wich i pay anyway for other stuff, but i really don't care if it get renew or not.",IMDB,How to pad a 2h movie into an 8 episodes miniseries.,5.0
"If this were a show about, say, two new cafe co-owners that were thrown together to run a cafe, I think it could be great. The spy plots, on the other hand, are so forced and unbelievable that it throws off the pacing of what could be a very good romantic comedy.Glover and Erskine are good together and build a nice rapport, but after three episodes of goofy plots and slapdash spycraft, I was left wondering who the idiot was who hired them (the spies, not the actors). I get it that the perfect-at-everything spy thrillers are old-hat by now, but mediocre-at-everything spy thrillers aren't thrilling, and just keep you wondering why the cops aren't after them after all the clues they've left behind as people fall dead or go missing in their wake.",IMDB,Not Great,5.0
"There is a real problem with a TV series or movie when a five minute cameo is the best part the work and that is exactly what happens here, Alexander Skarsgard and Eiza Gonzalez absolutely smash it out of the park as John and Jane (but not THE John and Jane) in the opening scene from episode one and after that it's downhill all the way. The first big problem is the lack of chemistry between the two leads, Glover and Erskine have nothing going on and that is reflected in the totally unreal arc of the characters. The second big problem is the pace, SO SLOW and with no payoff for that slowness, no character development, no reveals, literally nothing. The biggest problem however is the concept, two complete strangers with some kind of background in the military/intelligence world are put together by a bizarrely secret/corporate organisation, are shown to be pretty average at what they do, yet are completely OK with blowing up a houseful of people for no reason other than it's the mission and putting the body of a man they have killed in a composting machine. The casualness of this is definitely sociopathic; the collateral damage of the bombing is shrugged off - pretty sure the staff were just ordinary working stiffs, and after the composting they have rampant sex despite having known each other for a couple of weeks and automatically become ""an item"".

How could this even come close to a seven? This is the stupidest dialogue the most predictable problems. There is no chemistry between these two.

I keep wanting to like it and think it's going to get interesting but it's still remains boring as heck. I can't get these hours back that I wasted watching this. The fight scenes are way too long. No real movement in these characters. None of it makes sense at all! This other couple joining them is ridiculous. Now they're going after them?

"Will you like this? Depends what you're looking for.75% of the show is them talking through their relationship troubles. It's well acted, believable, and a nice story arc. If you want a relationship drama, you'll enjoy it.The spy stuff is seriously half-assed though. It's frustrating to watch and takes you out of the experience, because it's supposed to be some international secret spy agency, but they act more like untrained buffoons who happen to fight like Bruce Lee. They talk like they're serious people, but then blunder into every situation with zero planning and completely wing it. They seem unequipped and unprepared for every scene. Their handler doesn't help either by giving them 1 sentence of instruction, like ""protect this person"", and none of the detailed intel you would expect to actually make the mission a success. Who is trying to stop us? What do they look like? Do you know about any bombs that could kill us?The show just really lacks that high-tech, highly-trained, intelligence ops kind of feel that makes people love spy stuff. It feels more like some ex-UFC fighters who do random jobs for some crypto bro through the internet.It's clear the spy stuff was secondary to the writers, but it's so incomplete that doesn't feel like the characters in the show care about it either.",IMDB,"Solid relationship drama, disappointing spy/action",4.0
"Well it was definitely not what I expected. I think I get what this show was trying to do but it just couldn't get there. The acting is superb and is really the only thing saving this show. The whole cast was exceptional. But bad writing and so so directing couldn't save it. I don't understand why the current trend of action, thriller, or spy movies and shows is overly emotional. It's all so touchy-feely. It's like estrogen overload. I get this show was trying to be something different and I guess appeal to a wider audience? But it was basically watching a married couple work out their problems while doing some hit work on the side. The limited action was decent but was quickly overshadowed by the couple's emotional state and whiny ass complaining about each other. Action can have drama and emotions but good lord, this was way too much in the feelings department.",IMDB,"It tried, but meh",5.0
Very overated show in my opinion. The acting is good but unfortunately the characters literally waste more than half of the episodes runtime on small talk that leads nowhere and when the entertainment finally arrives it's all rushed and quick to conclude. Slow burn can be good sometimes when the conversations are actually meaningful or funny but there's none of that here. The slow portions of this series take upto 20-30min of a 45min runtime and yet they seem to exist merely to pass time and save on funds. I'll admit the show does have it's moments but I doubt anyone who's watched a fair share of television or film would see this as anything other than hot garbage.,IMDB,A bore fest!,1.0
"I whished I liked it, but it was just utter trash. The writing was just awful, nothing really exciting or spy stuff. When there was action it was just OK. But mostly it just boring talk, like watching a bad Woody Allen movie. Casting was also not great, both the main characters don't really have a spark onscreen. Glover might be a great actor in other things, but he wasn't in this, which he mostly created, written and produced. Even the last episode was a miss in regard to writing and wasn't really believable if you've actually paid attention during the previous 7 episodes.

"This really has no relation to the film of the same name in terms of plot, general vibe, genre, or otherwise. That is fine, but the name and high level description of the show sets certain expectations, which are not met.First of all, this is not an action, comedy or spy thriller. If you are looking for that, you won't really find it here. Action sequences are few and far between, and those that do exist are very poorly executed. The spy action in this show I would score a 1/10.This show is a drama about two flawed, awkward people working through a situational relationship. And, if that is what it was advertised as this, and all the spy stuff was removed, it would be a decent show.At some point , one of the leads tells another character they are a computer scientist. This is believable. If these same characters were actually awkward, flawed computer scientists forced together through some circumstance, then things you see on screen would make sense.The issue is these characters are just not in the least bit believable as secret agents capable of murder in cold blood, assassinations, and the like. The juxtaposition between the drama scenes, and the ""action"" involved in their missions just is jarring and pulls you completely out of the story.In short, the personal drama in the show sits at complete odds with the spy stuff, and each makes the other unbelievable.",IMDB,"Not what I expected, in a bad way",4.0
"I have to admit I have a similar sensation to a lot of low star reviews - this show started off with a huge bang but then kind of petered out. The opening scene is so intriguing yet 2 episodes in nothing remotely as high-impact occurs again, although there is a bit of intrique about once every 20 min.If the intent of that opening scene was to show the demise of the previous Mr & Mrs Smith from the 2005 film, as a plethora of other reviews confidently claim, why did the couple look completely unlike Brad & Angie?First of all, the 2005 film is, itself, a remake; take on the 90s tv series starring Scott Bacula and Maria Bello - 2 spies who pose as a married couple. It's an action comedy. So it's much more likely this current show is a remake of that 90s series. The opening scene is much more likely just showing what happened to their predecessors and what John and Jane may have to look forward to.My disappointment is in the rediculously unnatural and drawn out dialog between the couple, mainly, as well as the utter incompetence of these two. On their first assignment, they haven't bothered to exchange phone numbers until they must waste precious seconds right before key actions must be taken. They drop off a package that appears to be a benign insignificant item but, although it was delivered in a metal box, neither manages to take it seriously until they realize they just escaped with their lives - and then run frantically as if being chased. Then when they are supposed to get info out of a millionaire, they take him to their own house after realizing they essentially just gave him an overose because they had no plan of any kind before embarking on the charade. I'm just not convinced 5th graders couldn't show more intelligence than these two.Is it supposed to be funny, that they're so inept and focused on petty conversation or their sexual needs and fear of intimacy?This is so targeted at today's generation of poorly educated, poorly disciplined, navel focused crowd who can actually identify with these characters. The alleged humor lies in the couple's bumbing inability to hold an authentic conversation that doesn't indulge their own needs and idiocyncracies. Now on E4, I've only slightly chuckled twice.So, if you aren't one of them, you will likely not enjoy this series since 30 min of each 45 min episode is spent watching these two acting slighty above the IQ of a 10 year old with a lot of carrot on the stick innuendo about their far and few spy activities - which, honestly, seems more like another waiting game.",IMDB,A show with huge mood swings,5.0
"First if all. I never saw the original series. I did see the movie, and I liked it, so I had high hopes for this remake. Decent actors, and a good plot. A lot of hype...
Episode one was promising. Two, kept the promise alive. But after that it was mainly down hill. For me it lacked a proper sense of humour. It lacked action. The little action scenes that do come up, are shot in a way that doesn't quite meassure up to 2024 standards. So if you are looking for a fun and action packed series, like I hoped for, this doesn't quite deliver. Way too much boring conversations with little or no significance to the plot. Maybe it would have worked if it was two-three episodes shorter.However, if you do look for a more serious show, with a lot of personnal interaction, slow conversation on basically the same topic (will you love me/I dont think you do...?) and in general, a series to watch as a couple, I guess it hits the spot ok? I would be careful to put it into a «gender-box», and I'm sure it is a show for everyone and no-one, and I guess that's a strenght in itself?To sum it up; another mini series that runs way too long, but high quality acting, and several good parts.

No, diversity of cast is not the gripe, nor is it inherently bad - but when your show hopes that casting is enough to carry it through, then it all seems for vapid and without merit.The writing feels amateurish and juvenile. Dialogue seems to fit within high school movies, not so much when bound to a supposed spy versus spy motif.Overall, this show ends up feeling like another empty offering to audiences that loved the source material, only to be slapped with the modernity of ticks in boxes.Hard pass.",IMDB,The Writing has Failed the Mission,3.0
"But this is actually worse in some respects.It's a shame because it's a missed opportunity, as the cast is great including the many guest stars, and the acting is actually good, apart from the action sequences.What lets it down is the script and the directing.The script is missing a backstory, almost completely.We have no idea who these people are, why they have made the choices they have, or for that matter why they are supposed to be competent killers... and at the end of season 1 were are barely any wiser.It makes the characters one dimensional and rather uninteresting.As for the directing it's mostly about the action scenes, as they are simply not put together well enough.In hand to hand fight scenes everyone moves too slow, stuff that shouldn't hurt particularly is highly impactful, while stuff that should put a man down they just shake off.In gun fights they don't move like professionals, they don't handle weapons like professionals, they make impossible long range one handed shots on the run with pistols, but can't hit a barn door with a submachine gun at 5 paces.Even just the act of running makes them seem untrained.Not to mention to dumb usual Hollywood mistakes, where people can take cover from bullets behind a couch or the door of a refrigiator, and bullets that miss the target magically also miss the full wall of glass right behind the target.It makes the whole thing seem outdated, disingenuous and cheap.I'll score it a middle of the road 5, and watch for massive improvements in season 2, or I'll stop watching.",IMDB,I wasn't a fan of the movie.,5.0

Definitely kind of weird, not really digging the actors as the main characters, their personalities are just dull and off and they have no chemistry. When they killed off the cat in the last episode it made me pretty upset and was really unnecessary. Probably won't watch if there's another season. The ending was really off and not satisfying after watching 8 episodes of the show. Definitely not anywhere as good as the original Mr and Mrs Smith was. I would be surprised if they renew it for another season to be honest.",IMDB,It was just ok. Ending was upsetting.,5.0
"With each episode, the focus turns more and more towards the drama and relationship stuff. The title was a cheap shot at easy publicity.I didn't have much expectations given how Amazon always effs up its productions - like it did with Lord of the Rings and Wheel of Time. Their mantra is probably ""throw money to make more money"" rather than good scripts and bringing together talented people who are passionate about cinema.If we honestly take it for what it is, it feels mediocre but definitely not bad. However, when we start with expectations because of the title Mr & Mrs Smith and assumptions on how a spy series would be, then it is bound to feel like a disastrous show!",IMDB,Title was a BAIT,5.0
"Even without comparing it to the film, I didn't find myself enjoying this series as much as I could have.I thought the performance from the actors was great, and how they displayed the dynamic relationship. But as characters in a show, I found them terrifically annoying therefore hard to continue to watch. I understand that this show is centralised around them, hence the name, but some scenes in my opinion dragged on (for example, the truth serum scene, in the last episode. I found myself a little bored as they continue to move like snails whilst on the truth serum. They tried working out the problem, as they could be honest with each other, but us the audience already knew how they were both in their wrong).What I think they could've taken further was the idea of Hihi, as this mysterious company with different levels of missions, why they can only have 3 fails, etc. The closest we got to this was the other Mr. And Mrs. Smith couple, who were no better than the John and Jane we got to focus on. They seemed like a high and pretentious couple.",IMDB,Mr & Mrs Smith,3.0
Slow story development plus annoying female lead not a great start to a show. I definitely will not be watching any further. They should've cast Eisa Gonzalez as the main female lead instead of being a cameo in the introductions.There are simply too many boring character interactions during this episode. They should've made things more interesting immediately to reel people in before all these awkward conversations. With so much good content available now a show has to be really compelling for people to invest their time on new material. The main purpose of a tv show like this should be to entertain and it has failed.,IMDB,First episode only review,2.0
"This may be a good viewing experience for couples who refuse to interact with one another. For anyone else, the acting seems wooden and prone to empty pauses. That's right. Empty pauses. ... The talent is there but the direction is lost in ennui. Alienation, though, requires a release, to refill the emptiness. But that has hand happened here so far Unfortunately, I sense that the denouement might be rather a predictable formula rather than a capable rendering of complimentary vacuousness. Too bad, because given the talent it is lost. I stopped caring. Too bad, because I really like many modern spy dramas, but this just seems to be a version lite of the depths of previous and more well written spy concepts that involve more to accomplice that strange symmetry.",IMDB,A whirlpool of silent dram,4.0
"I love action movies and series, but this one is kind of lame. When it comes to Spy and C. I. A, I expect grand action and suspense, but this is giving more comedy, drama, romance and a little action. I didn't need the romance and drama part because it's kind of taking away from the real job, they spend more time getting to know each other than getting the job done. The characters on another hand are good actors, however I am not sure if they fit the series in my opinion. When it comes to the actions, it's giving very much ""meh"". I seen way better action series than this. The beginning started off good and end up being a lil cheesy. They also got the job so easy without showing what they are capable of, and in my opinion they are not skilled enough to do the job because of the cowardly actions they shown. I am at episode 4 and I stop watching because it didn't excite me that much but I might continue, just because I am hoping it proves me wrong.",IMDB,A lil lame,4.0

"The TV Show is just related to the 2005 movie by name, everything else is unrelated, which at first sight could have been a good move to create something new and fresh that had the movie's feeling but with different characters and a new story. However, I am just into the second episode and in both of them they just talk and talk for like most of half episode, which wouldn't be bad if the dialogue between them was good, which it isn't: it's just plain boring and unrealistic with lots of exposition. The characters themselves are also plenty dull and there's not much chemistry between the two leads. As I said before, in episode 1 and 2 there is like 75% boring dialogue and the remaining 25% is action, which was honestly the best thing in the show, as the missions they found themselves entangled in were pretty funny and entertaining. Overall, I had to stop watching the series after episode 2 because I didn't care about the characters at all or its story.",IMDB,Aimless TV Series that lacks the charm and comedy of the 2005 movie,1.0

It's obviously not the movie or show, but it could really have benefited from a title change. That's a huge problem here, especially pacing wise. It just doesn't flow in any fashion.Although im not feeling all that compelled to continue watching, I will. This just feels like lame spycraft with terrible dialogue, but decent acting.We shall see how it all turns out, but my hopes are set at medium for the moment. Enjoy what you want to enjoy, people.

"Ive watched the first three episodes and I have to say that the plot is not bad, the action is pretty decent, the acting is quite good and Donald glover is really hot :). However I felt that there wasnt enough story dedicated to John and jane's emerging relationaship and it all happens too fast. Also, it seems like there is not much chemistry between Glover and Erskine and that really affects the credibility of the whole plot line. I will continue to watch as I love the fact that each episode has a different story line, camera work is good and the dialogue is quite good and it's quite entertaining.",IMDB,Not bad,5.0
"I manage to watch 3 episodes. Every episode has a hole in the story or something illogical. For instance, guy gets shot through his cheeks and dies from ot on the spot...main characters literally take of with the druged billionaire in front of room full of people, some of them recording everything, drive of with him, he dies in their house, and no one looks for him? Video+road and street cameras+a missing billionaire and no one cares and/or can't find them? A black guy and asian girl couple?Guy has a shootout with a bunch of people, kills them, frees some lady, no one cares about dead hanchman, shooting at winter resort, and the freed multimillionaire lady does not want anything investigated, no cops, no nothong?

"I've been watching this in between watching some British spy series. One is super low key, layered and intelligent and the other... uh, this one, seems to be aimed at high schoolers. But, yeah, it has big stars, hyper modern production (but the dialog mix! Lol) and beautiful locations, etc. If that's all you want, it's great.For me, the script is just abysmal. It started out really engaging and mysterious, which hooked me in pretty good. I just finished the 4th episode and the romcom stuff is just ruining it completely.I get it that they are both ""rejects"" in the real world, hence their choice to be assassins, but geeeeeeeezuzzz are they dim. John calling his mom twice a day? The other Smith couple? Going ""off mission""/""rogue"" constantly.Actually, episode 3 seemed to go so far off mission that I thought for sure they were getting another ""fail""! Yet, nothing happened. Not even a check in summary from ""Hihi"". So I have no idea how serious any of this is as a spy thriller. It seems like that was just a hook to get us into this really banal romcom with utterly inane banter (written by 12 year olds?).I'm seriously on the fence whether or not to continue to episode 5. The seriously painfully slow ""wine party"" with cringe inducing dialog was f'n hard to get through. Is this going to keep happening? Are they going to keep getting dumb missions that they deviate from so that they can call their mom, go shopping or lay around in bed exchanging delightfully juvenile bon mots? Please kill me now!Maybe I'll go watch the Avengers to clean my palette? A little Steed and Peel!",IMDB,Devolved REAL quickly into romcom,3.0
"You start off the show with some nice eye candy, thinking it will be on par with the classic fun movie, then that quickly fizzles and dies (literally). Then we learn who the protagonists actually are. Who are they? DEI candidates. More disappointingly, they're dull and boring. No humor. No personalities. Nothing exciting about them at all. When comparing to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt chemistry these two were just painful. Are they the same characters from the 2005 movie? I don't know. And they're just at the beginning of their journey it appears, with little experience but they could have created some more entertaining characters.The poor casting isn't likely even the reason the characters are horrible. It's the writing. The camera work. The mood and tone and even the music. It's all slow, boring, and just off for this genre. They literally had a shot of Donald Glover (John) walking across the road for 15-20 seconds. We just watched him walk across a street. Why!? And the dialogue is slow! It's like pulling teeth listening to them talk, and the long pauses watching them stare off into space, just had me close to walking away.The one action scene we had in the first episode was predictable. Nothing new. It was short, and confusing. They're being chased by somebody. Who knows who they were? Suddenly Jane and John duck into an ally, and somehow the people chasing them lost them? Now Jane has to act like she was hurt by rubbing John's blood on her face? Why!? What did I just watch? What is happening? Then she gets an Uber ride home? Geez, who wrote this show?I expected some energy. Some fun. Comedy and action. We get none of that. I only watched one episode but I'm done. If it gets better I'll never find out. A pilot should pull people in not push them away. If you're going to make a TV series based on the story of a popular movie you should follow the same recipe. Epic fail.",IMDB,Painfully Slow and Dull,2.0
"It had a unique premise of partnering with another person who was applying for a similar job profile as a spy. I expected it to have interesting plots and missions. While it started with an unexpected twist at the beginning, it quickly turned into a drama that was really boring. As the show progresses, it becomes more and more about their personal relationship with very little to no focus on spy missions.The characters in the beginning were not really up to the spy work, as the show progresses it gets worse even though they try to show Jane's progress in the work.Overall not worth watching at all.",IMDB,Boring drama,1.0
"I had high hopes at the start. There was a palpable sense that the series would combine witty one liners and improbable but exciting action scenes but as the series progressed it became predictable in the extreme.The obvious hip mixed race casting of Erskine and Glover is in itself trite and overplayed. Plus the overdone references to white people.... it's.. done to death and unfunny. .....tiring to always hear phrases like ..""you are so white""....
The simple fact is there was zero chemistry between the two leads, both fine actors as they are.The use of tier 1 actors in Cameo roles is fun and Wagner Mora and Sharon Horgan are great to watch in their respective episodes.The script has some laughs and a nice self deprecating tone but my god it drags every episode out so much. By the time we get to episode 4 with the two Mr and Mrs Smiths which was beyond obvious what's going to happen things began to go south. Episode 5 with its simplistic nods to pregnancy and kids and a truly woeful cameo by Ron Perlman.The series has wildly improbable action scenes that are fun but sadly too few. The so called character development takes up the bulk of the show which is really aimed at a female audience.I am happy to binge watch The Night Manager or Slow Horses , high class drama , but Mr and Mrs Smith is certainly not that.Save yourself the time and watch it if your wife insists.",IMDB,"Dull ,predictable and plodding rehash",4.0
"There are some great actors in this show and overall they do a really good job. Being a big fan of Mr and Mrs Smith movie I had high expectations for some great action scenes. This movie totally failed at that and the action scenes are absolutely horrendous.It feels like watching a video game story mode, the bad guys have incredible aim and speed when someone needs to be killed for the story, but then when the protagonists are in danger the bullets just casually land just in front of them without batting an eye - then they run out into the open and they are totally safe. One of the characters literally even mentions 'its not safe to cross that bridge' the guy goes 'i have a plan' but then they cross the bridge and the plan isn't even related to the bridge.. We were just suppose to forget some angel carried them across the bridge safely. It's not like there's any perceived skill, they just know the bullets will land all around them and therefore have nothing to worry about. There are bad guys shown approaching from the rear and then in the next angle they just disappear even though they were approaching faster then the characters are moving. One example of this is a motorbike that is approaching one second and disappears the next. Instead of having the feeling these are some skilled assassins' it feels like total luck they are even surviving and that the action scenes are just necessary and getting them out of the way for the Segway into the next scene.Just totally awfully designed action scenes. Right off the bat from the first scene with who is presumably suppose to be Angelina Jolie action scene, even that one is silly with her performing a ridiculous slow motion 360 upon coming out to the front porch. They really could have had a great show if they just hired the people that produced any of the highly popular action movies of recent times such as the John Wick franchise always being the prime example of how to do action scenes.",IMDB,Has a lot of good but ruined by the awful action scenes,3.0
"""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" has an undeniably 'intriguing' premise: a seemingly ordinary couple who are secretly top spies. However, the execution falls short in a few key areas.Firstly, while the supporting cast delivers (just) OK performances, Maya Erskine's portrayal of the female lead struggles to fully convince. The writing itself also suffers from occasional illegalities and plot holes, which can be frustrating in a genre that relies heavily on suspense and logic.Furthermore, the show relies heavily on dialogue, which, while well-written at times, can feel excessive for a spy thriller. This, coupled with a somewhat static visual style reminiscent of a stage play, can leave viewers yearning for more action and dynamic camerawork.Despite its shortcomings, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" holds potential, but maybe for second season and more nuanced lead performance/s, tighter writing and a more visually engaging style, it could evolve into a more captivating series.However, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", in its current form, it's a lukewarm watch that fails to fully deliver on its premise.Rating: 5- out of 10.",IMDB,"Intriguing Premise, Needs Polish",5.0
"The actors are great, and have serious about of chemistry. The plots are unrealistic, and you end up with a lot of questions. Wouldn't you smell a dead body? Do you often compost things in plastic? Who takes care of the cat when they are away? If they weren't allowed to bring their old lives, why is the cat already in the apartment?The spies make tons of mistakes that aren't addressed (they tell everybody everything).That they included the purr of the cat in the audio is awesome.But the show probably has some important information in the text messages the spies receive. Wouldn't know, because we can only read parts of some of them on a regular TV. I can't imagine watching it on a tablet (maybe they'd be easier to read because a tablet is closer?).",IMDB,Texting is Hell,5.0
"I actually thought I had reviewed this series when I watched it a few months ago, but apparently not. I must have been so taken by it - and unfortunately not in a good way - that I forgot.In my view the series peaked in the first scene when the beautiful couple (Alexander Skarsgård and Eiza Gonzalez) gets assassinated. That was good action. The rest of the series is ridiculous because it's whole premise is preposterous. And by that I mean that it beggars belief in that it does not make us, as viewers, wilfully suspend our disbelief, which is the whole idea of movies and series. It tries to cover this significant flaw by a sheen of (half-)witty dialogue, swanky locations and shiny things.It flies in the face of the above basic requirement of a fictional tale on-screen that two persons, who are entirely unknown to each other, would be paired up by an organisation tasked with important things to do anything of importance. Just look at Survivor, Big Brother and Married At First Sight, to name a few. How well does that go? The characters in this series are not far from the average contestant in those shows. And these characters get to play with REAL guns and blow stuff up for REAL (in the fictional universe, of course).Cool-looking clothes abound as much as the constantly pissed off face on Maya Erskine's character and the silly puppy-like accept-it-all behaviour of Donald Glover's John. The writers try to create a bit of tension with the introduction of a second similar couple which gives us a glimpse into how the corporation behind this fast and loose enterprise works. Evidently it's a set-up for the inevitable second season, but it doesn't give us anything new. Naturally there needs to be a swanky cottage on a lake, and Lake Como no less.But that this egocentric and mutually distrustful couple would be tasked with personal extraction situations, armed high-intensity work and no-room-for-failure missions is just impossible to even begin to fathom. The story breaches too many of the necessary links to reality to be engaging and watchable.Perhaps I set the bar too high for what to expect. But this series is nothing special. It seems to me to be a sign o' the times - surface before substance, sparkles before skill. It's the social-media equivalent of reality, a glossy filter to hide imperfections and make people believe that getting anywhere, becoming anything doesn't require work, dedication and sacrifice.That's not how it works and no amount of dialogue, smirky grins, fancy locations or high-paced action will ever cover those flaws.

The premise is interesting. The execution is some what inconsistent, but when it works it works very well. The cinematography was great and the actors did a good job portraying the characters. I especially. Enjoyed watching the few big name actors having fun playing smaller roles.Where the series fails is that sometimes the theme and premise comes through as well as I would've hoped.
