"It's sleek, but not stylish; it's grimy, but in a cool, clean way. And though it's a show that relishes banter and verbal sparring, the action set-pieces are what truly draw you in...",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"... Despite the whole thing being an anti-spy thriller, this isn't Le Carré — it's a whole lot funnier.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Slow Horses” remains one of the most entertaining and well-put-together shows around. The motions through which it goes are good ones.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"After four seasons Slow Horses finally gets some Emmy recognition. This truly epic espionage thriller with Gary Oldman is everything a great series should be and more. With flawless source material and an epic ensemble, Slow Horses is storming stuff.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"This remains Oldman’s show first and last, but everyone has a chance to shine.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
It’s still utterly brilliant.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Much like the veteran leader of the titular team of washed-up MI5 agents (played by Gary Oldman), the show hasn’t lost any of its edge into its fourth season. If anything, the latest offering is the finest it has ever been.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Slow Horses continues to be ludicrously implausible, and I wish Lamb and Diana would verbally spar more often (it’s so rare it feels like script rationing), but it’s still got the touch.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Slow Horses is thrilling, often improbably so. But it's also keenly attuned to the dynamics and psychology of the trade -- what it means to understand people as expendable pieces in an unwinnable game",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"And among car chases worthy of Hollywood blockbusters and several edge-on-your-seat shoot-outs, what makes Slow Horses season 4 essential viewing is that it’s all about relationships.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Slow Horses is exciting and suspenseful TV and one of the great under-appreciated gems of our current streaming era.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Slow Horses complex characters continue to hash out their issues this season, and while everyone is exceptional, this is Lowden’s finest hour.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Still, such moments of earnestness are never overplayed in a show that, perhaps more than any other right now, celebrates that distinctly British penchant for caustic wit and withering cynicism.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Slow Horses never rushes and also never feels like a grueling slow burner. Like any good thriller, it doesn’t waste time and pays meticulous attention to how the plot should weave together by the end of the season.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"With this level of output, you’d be forgiven for assuming the quality would vary wildly, and yet Slow Horses has become that most wondrous of things: a truly reliable televisual crowd-pleaser.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The depiction of the power-game shenanigans going on overhead, across town at the service’s Regents Park nerve centre, is another of its many joys.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Slow Horses may still be a safe bet, but it’s not entirely the same old same old.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"If anything, each series improves slightly on the last. Watching it is pure pleasure. There isn’t a wasted scene or a duff piece of dialogue. Every performance is perfectly calibrated...",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Slow Horses continues to be entertaining because of the show’s quirky characters, not the least of which is Oldman’s character Jackson Lamb.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"[Director] Randall’s biggest achievement here is in not messing about with what came before. As with the directors of the previous seasons, Randall strictly adheres to Smith’s vision of what the latter has described as the “anti-Bond.”",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Tackling a new case each season, while keeping the same format and framework, is enormously satisfying when done well.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"As ever, though, it is Oldman you want to watch the most, contaminating the screen beautifully and weaponising how greasily disgusting he looks.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Season 4, adapted from Spook Street, the fourth novel in Herron’s series, raises the emotional stakes considerably for the elder Cartwright’s grandson River, the rising young agent who was condemned to the drudgery of Slough House...",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"No homework is required, nor is it difficult to get up to speed on what’s happening. You can just dive right into the latest adventure on this enormously entertaining show -- and if you haven’t yet, you should.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"A good, dynamic show. It may start at a slow trot, but quickly gains momentum until it's a frenzied race to the unexpected conclusion.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Smart, funny, and emotionally resonate (there’s some sad, dark moments this time around that will undoubtedly reverberate into season five), this latest Slow Horses season is well worth your time.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Slow Horses is one of the consistently best shows on streaming. While the latest isn’t the best season in the series, it’s yet another reminder that Apple’s streak of picking winners remains unbroken.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Slow Horses Season 4 continues the series’s trademark thrilling, complex, and devastating narrative bent while innovating new developments to keep us on our toes.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"There is no greater pleasure than to watch Gary Oldman work his magic on screen with the incomparable Kristin Scott Thomas, the wryly deadpan Joanna Scanlan and the brilliant Jonathan Pryce.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"In Season 4, the hidden histories of the Cartwright family are revealed, creating an engaging and tension-ridden hunt for the truth.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Just as with previous seasons, it’s a little like a John le Carre novel with comedy, and season four is even better than the previous one, and as good as the first and second.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"As impossible as it may sound, the new set of six episodes is the best yet.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It subverts the traditional spy story and reinvents it as a drama about a dysfunctional family. There is vinegary comedy and bone-cracking violence, too.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
[Adam] Randall’s work here is the most satisfying deployment of his skills to date.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
Season 4 of the best spy series on TV uncovers hidden agendas and poignant truths.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"For fans of the show, season four won’t be a disappointment, pivoting to a new storyline that incorporates all the entertaining elements audiences have come to expect.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It’s one of the great shows to come out of Britain full stop. And series four delivers more of the same: a fully realised world, superb script, a stellar cast all at the top of their game and a lot of great action.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The most personal season of Slow Horses yet raises the stakes like never before, with Jack Lowden and Jonathan Pryce taking the spotlight in style. It’s just a shame the rest of our beloved band of rejects get somewhat lost in the mix.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"One of the joys of Slow Horses is its ability to balance an inherently dramatic narrative with a wry sense of humor. That still exists, but Season 4 is more personal, and, thus, feels more consequential than its predecessors.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Darkly funny and tighter than the buttons on Lamb's sauce-stained shirt, this is yet another outstanding season for Apple’s brilliantly unconventional spy series.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Season 4 of Slow Horses is firmly the best of the show yet, boasting the most exciting and complex story we’ve seen so far",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Such impressive performances really highlight how much this series values its characters. [...] The genuinely compelling – and surprisingly poignant – narrative is just a bonus, because it’s in the spies that this spy caper has always found it’s magic.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Gary Oldman plays the quintessential crusty old curmudgeon, an MI5 spy left over from the Cold War (and ostracised to Slough House), still parrying at shadows, and seeing real threats before anyone else.This is stylised Cold War spy craft in a modern setting - and it's a very satisfying watch. Another well-realised show that creates its immediate world with details of environment, character (and subterfuge) - the indispensable building blocks of good story telling.If you're just coming upon this show now that season 2 is released you should do yourself a favour and binge season 1 first - it's a good yarn and will offer a depth of character and situation that will add to your enjoymentSeason 2 appears to have lifted the game in terms of production design and cinematography - it's really paid off and elevated the show above the usual weekly episodic grind TV.Highly recommended - Oldman and Kristin Scott-Thomas are terrific, as are Jack Lowden and Saskia Reeves.",IMDB,Crusty old curmudgeon,9.0
"I watched this because I'd been watching foreign series and was tired of subtitles. So glad I did!Great cast of true characters - Gary Oldman - you can't go wrong with him. And same with all the rest. Finally a series that isn't polished and pretty, but it has a lot of grit and history.Binged all of Season 1 in one evening. Am anxious for Season 2.Something interesting to look forward to!!",IMDB,"Finally! A good spy series - by the Brits, of course!",9.0
Slow Horses is a pretty good spy thriller that's definitely worth watching. I never read the books so I didn't know much about it but the reviews have been great so I gave it a chance. Gary Oldman is as terrific as ever and leads a very talented cast. Oldman has been so great in so many movies/shows that it's hard to keep track but this is absolutely one of his best performances yet! I have to admit that the first 2 episodes started a little slow and it was hard to get into but by the end of episode 2 it really picks up and from there on out it will keep you entertained and guessing what's going to happen next! It's already been renewed for another 3 seasons (through season 4) which is pretty much unheard of so that right there should tell you how good this show is. If you're looking for a new show to watch and you're into spy thrillers then give this a try...you won't be disappointed!,IMDB,Solid Spy Series!,8.0
"Gary Oldman is brilliant, just brilliant. I've watched two episodes and I'm hooked. I love the story, the sets and setting, the acting is superb throughout. I will be watching the entire series more than once. It's the sort of Drama the UK was once famous for. A massive thumbs up to all involved.Have now watched Season Two, it's still stunning, the best TV Drama I've seen in years and years. An absolute must watch and I hope they do the full Eight seasons (Based on the Novels)I'm now watching Season Three...this is the best Television series I've ever seen. It's still above brilliant Three seasons in.",IMDB,Loving it....,10.0
I wasn't expecting to enjoy Slow Horses as much as I did. I was looking for a new show to watch to heard really good things about this show and you can't go wrong with Gary Oldman either. He's great in just about everything he's ever been in. It's no different here. He's the best thing about the show but not the only thing. The rest of the cast more than holds their own. I got so into this that I binged both seasons in just few days. It seems that most people enjoyed as much as I did because it's already been renewed for another two seasons! I can't wait to see more of this group of dysfunctional MI5 agents!,IMDB,Better Than Expected,8.0
Ignore most of the reviews here; either they didn't actually watch it long enough to understand what was going on or they were not bright enough.If you liked the books you'll probably enjoy it even though the characters were not quite as I imagined them.This is not a series to watch if you want a lot of action (The first episode may be misleading).This is not a series to watch if you want a handsome hero to ride of into the sunset with the girl (swap genders to whatever rocks your boat).This is a series to watch if you want geat characters and story.,IMDB,True to the books,8.0
"Gary Oldman has already proved himself as a master in the political and espionage thriller sub-genres, with his powerful performance in the Oscar-winning ""The Darkest Hour (2017)"" as well as the more understated by equally effective ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)"". He has portrayed gravitas, charisma, calm under pressure as well as steadfast efficiency very well on screen but Apple TV+'s new offering showcases an altogether different dimension to the British veteran, one laced with dry British wit and wry humour while never letting up on the espionage thrill elements.We follow the story of MI5 agent ""Jackson Lamb"" (Oldman) who runs a sub-group within the intelligence agency dubbed the ""Slow Horses"" since it is primarily composed of disgraced, underperforming has-beens who no one else seems to want. Lamb seems perfectly happy running routine operations and surveillance gigs when his team gets inadvertently embroiled in a kidnapping of a Muslim youngster, presumably executed by right-wing fundamentalists.Featuring Jonathan Pryce, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Saskia Reeves, Jack Lowden and a host of fine British actors, Slow Horses takes care to paint vivid character sketches of its motley crew of temperamental agents, all with a point to prove given their sordid pasts. Director James Hawes builds his narrative slowly but self-assuredly across six wholesome episodes, which are full of unexpected twists and turns as the stakes get progressively higher and the conspiracy, more convoluted as the team tracks down one lead after another.Oldman is in blistering form as the caustic, trash-talking spymaster who seems to use mockery and disdain as weapons to get his team to perform and the supporting cast play an able foil to the old master, creating a vivid world that intrigues as well as makes you chuckle at the most unexpected junctures. The writing from Morwenna Banks; Will Smith; Jonny Stockwood; Mark Denton deserve special praise for striking the right balance between character development, suspense, unexpected twists and humour. Apple TV+ has another winner on its hands, with ""Slow Horses"", alongside ""Severance"" clearly emerging as one of the Best new series of 2022. Highly recommended and I cannot wait for Season 2!",IMDB,Gary Oldman you monster!!,8.0
"This is an unusual case where it is better than the book it was based on. The books are SLOW, often going over unnecessary details not relevant to the story. All that is gone in the translation to visual media. The story is tight and while some details have changed, its to better fit with the format.Production values are top notch and Gary Oldman is great as Jackson Lamb. I don't know where some folks got that this is some woke drama, but the gender and racial makeup is on par with the original source material, so that guy who wrote the review needs to put his big boy pants on and join the real world.",IMDB,Better than the book,8.0
"S. Best spy TV show in a long time, combined with the social commentary that doesn't beat you over the head. And with some very subtle but increasingly fun British humor. You have a winner. Glad they have these into green light already. Of course Gary Oldman is perfect, but no one else has missed a beat either. Budget is movie quality. Writing is top notch. It deserves a nine easily but this is what we can expect from anything that says anything about anything in our world today. I'm just thankful for a show that has an opinion without compromising story or making me feel like I'm an idiot if I disagree.",IMDB,Best spy TV show in a long time,9.0
"If you wondered how Gary Oldman could be cast in a spy series after being Smiley once, this show answers the question: quite good. Surprisingly good. With the story material from reputable spy books author, the story as good as it could be. Cast and settings are top notch, jokes are authentic British ones, what else to ask for?This review was written with only three episodes in, but if you like British spy stuff, this series should be on your watch list, period.",IMDB,Oldman is back in service,7.0
"Lamb is just an amazing and complex character, he is suffering and its a very sad and pathetic guy, its an amazing protagonist alongside the rest of the fantastic cast.

"Season 1 is 6 episodes and season 2 is the same, Gary Oldman said that they've already filmed season 2 ""it's in the can"". ""Slow Horses"" is the beginning of the the Mick Herron's ""Slough House"" novels. Sir Mick Jagger helped write the theme song which he sings.It reminds me a lot of the John le Carre novels, le Carre (pen name of David Cornwell) actually worked for MI-5 and MI-6. MI-5 (the Security Service) is a domestic spy agency, but they have no police powers like America's FBI. This series is about MI-5 like the older TV series ""Spooks"". MI-6 (the Secret Intelligence Service) is foreign intelligence which was the subject of le Carre's novels about George Smiley.Two of le Carre's novels were made into TV series, the first ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" the 1979 TV series was about a mole in MI-6, it's a classic that starred Sir Alec Guinness. The 2011 movie of the same name starring Gary Oldman is good, but the TV series has more depth. It introduced us to ""Moscow Rules"" (not the same definition as this series) and ""outstations"" around London like Slough House in this series. ""Smiley's People"" a TV series also starring Sir Alec Guinness is also a classic.Writers of novels and screenplays take artistic license and I doubt the real MI-5 looks like this shoot'em up series. They are spies in the shadows, operations performed by the ""dogs"" would be performed by SO-15 the Counterterrorism Command of the Metropolitan Police (Scotland Yard). I read a lot of British news and I've never heard a counterterrorism action referred to as an ""MI-5 operation"" or the Director General of MI-5 referred to in the media as ""First Desk"", bad writing,Episode 6 didn't really tie everything together, it got the bums rush. Gary Oldman is great as Jackson Lamb, he wasn't really George Smiley as Alec Guinness had that sewed up. Jack Lowden, Saskia Reeves, Kristin Scott Thomas and the rest of the cast are very good, mostly drama school trained. Hope they continue with the rest of the Slough House books, it's entertaining if not all that realistic.Season 2 I enjoyed much more than the first season. Season 1 was mostly about Jackson Lamb verbally putting down staff at Slough House, it was one put down after another and it got boring. The second season shows MI-5 agents at Slough House using their spy skills but not really in a coordinated way.Lamb is a brilliant field agent, he's not really a manager of people. David Cartwright is a natural trainer, instructing his grandson (River) and giving him background information like their conversations about Dickie Bough and ""circadas"" and conversations in the first season.All the characters are flawed and it's not just at Slough House, from Tavener to Webb to Duffy they are also flawed at the Park. Herron and the screen writers aren't afraid of killing off characters which is good. The second season is funnier and gets out of London to the Cotswolds and eventually Kent. London and the locations in season 1 were cold and boring, packed with people but really very cold.I'm looking forward to seasons 3 & 4 in 2023.",IMDB,Season 1 and season 2 reviews.,7.0
"This has gotten better week after week. This review is after the third episode, and this is where i feel the pace picks up, and the early character establishment starts to pay off.Gary Oldman is just in top form here as the disgraced? Spy seemingly on the outer edges of the security services, who taken in other compromised agents. Yet he clearly is not just counting down the days in a dead end post, as we see as the ride hots up.",IMDB,Gary Oldman Is Disgusting And/Yet Brilliant,10.0
"My Review - Slow Horses
My Rating- 9/10Every large Government Department has its filing room or mail room that bosses can shove sideways the employees they consider unsatisfactory or require demotion to be exiled if they are deemed useless in their current role.This great spy romp is about the equivalent last frontier for failed MI5 spy agents who for one reason or another botch up their mission.This last outpost for failed British Intelligence Agents is headed by Jackson Lamb and brilliantly cast with Gary Oldman as the washed up seedy and incredibly belligerent boss . His surname is no indication of his personality I would think more of a drunken sloth than a lamb would suit his sarcastic but witty curmudgeonly personality.Along comes River Cartwright also beautifully cast with Jack Lowden who after a very shady frame up is despatched to Jackson Lamb's team of ""slow horses"" by his shrewish MI5 boss Diana Tavener ( Kristin Scott Thomas) .I always expect a quality production when Kristin Scott Thomas is in the cast and her duplicitous duet in this series with Gary Oldman is one of the the delights of this series for me.New recruit River Cartwright is not content and frankly pissed off with the menial and demeaning tasks that his new boss Jackson Lamb assigns him and the rest of the slow horse team . Their working days are spent with menial tasks like the analysis of stinking rubbish collating parking fines or transcribing mobile phone conversations.Against his bosses strict instructions of staying in the office and virtually doing nothing all day under the radar of the MI5 boss River Cartwright secretly joins in the MI5 surveillance hunt to save a young man threatened with beheading after being kidnapped by a terrorist cell.The series weaves an intricate web with surprising and dramatic outcomes for all the characters with a mix of some delicious black humour.There are many other delightful performances in Slow Horses including Saskia Reeves as Catherine Standish the world weary PA to Jackson Lamb and Sophie Okonedo the big boss of MI5 and the only person that can strike fear into the steely demeanour of Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas )
The other Slow Horses are all great characters in fact the whole ensemble cast help make this series enjoyable viewing one and the good news is series 2 was filmed at the same time and I hear Apple TV will screen it very soon.The trio of Directors James Hawes, Jeremy Lovering and Saul Metzstein plus Will Smith and his team of 4 script writers have seamlessly and beautifully adapted the 2010 novel by Mick Herron no wonder this series already has been renewed for a third and fourth season.",IMDB,Original Entertaining - Pythonesque Spy drama,9.0
"Wow, this was more like racing horses. First episode was really slow and boring, till things started rolling, and it was more like a non stop. Gary Oldman was simply brilliant, he did a fantastic job leading a secret operation while being damn funny.Good cast and performance from all actors, given the fact, they are not that famous. Loved each character, great plot, all the twist and turns till the last minute. This was a really good crime suspense thriller and can't wait for season two. Also , loved the fact that it was 6 episodes.This was the 3rd good tv show done by Apple, and again, can't wait for season 2.",IMDB,Racing horses,9.0
"In my mind Jackson Lamb was Timothy Spall and Katherine Standish was Olivia Coleman and I think they'd have nailed it.That said the casting is spot on, everyone is great. Also there should be a massive shout out to the location scouts, Slough House is exactly as I imagined it.The mood, intrigue and pace are as good as Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy.I have loved the books so much and am so happy that this has not had the over the top Hollywood treatment that these things often do. It's kept the grime and the humour that have made the books so enjoyable.I'm episode four in and can't stop..",IMDB,Fan of the books.,8.0
"This is sooooo good.Everything about this show is exceptionally good.It's even a pleasure to watch the main titles, and listen to Mick Jagger's haunting interpretation of the title song ""Strange Game"".Gary Oldman is at his peak in this part. He's perfect. And the rest of the cast delivers top-notch performances all-round. Even the bunch of idiot right-wing extremists are exceptionally good.And the script... it's the meat and bones of all this. Properly structured, and well furnished in every way.This is surely the most entertaining series I have ever seen in 50 years... after Monty Python's Flying Circus.",IMDB,Unbelievably good,10.0
"I have seen the first two episodes, and was disappointed only by the fact there will be only six, and then another six. Cast is fantastic, and though the dialog requires higher volume for these American ears, it is well written. I usually wouldn't watch the screen version of a book I might like to read, but I wanted to see this as soon as it came out, and didn't know if the books. I'll definitely read them later though. The theme song. As soon as I heard it, I thought, ""Surely they didn't get Mick Jagger""?! But it is, and the song is cool, with relevant lyrics and thematic elements of the score too. I see several reviews complaining about a 'leftist' bent to this one, but all I see is art imitating life with some of the plot lines. I recommend this one, unless you don't like elevated espionage fare. It's good, real good based on the first two hours.",IMDB,"Great show, cool theme song too.",8.0
"This series got off to a high-adrenaline start with a chase for a suicide bomber in the first few minutes. After that, things slowed down quite a bit. But by the end of the first episode, the premise was fairly well laid out, and most of the key characters were sketched in.I might be inclined to consider this an average British thriller series were it not for the presence of two big guns - Kristin Scott Thomas and Gary Oldman. That alone would be enough for me to give the show a chance. I'm going to watch a few more episodes before making up my mind on this one - but I am giving it a chance.",IMDB,Better than average British thriller,7.0

"I'm a hard-to-please guy. I have to be able to buy into characters, the plot has to make sense and the scenery/locations have to be genuine.This hits all marks, with the possible exception of Jagger croaking the theme song. I always fast forward through that.It's based on a series of novels about the British intelligence service, and a London field office where a few ""failures"" are banished to. They are just minor screw-ups, though. If they did something major they would by kicked out of MI5.Anyway, it's easy for me to buy into everything. The writing is great, the actors are great, the plots make sense...What can I say? Somebody found some really well-written novels by an author who knew what he was doing, and they successfully translated them into a series of 6-episode seasons.It works for me. Just the right blend of comedy, drama, mystery, action and story-telling.And because the seasons are fairly short, it doesn't take a lot of time to make new ones. Three seasons in two years, and two more are projected. So, that's nice too.",IMDB,This is Really Good,7.0

Or 2) Make your way through the kitchen and back door into a deserted and dimly lit alley?If 2) then Slow Horses is for you.

I give it a 10 for Gary oldham alone. He is so freaking brilliant if you don't watch the show just for that alone you're missing out. This guy is the definition of what every good actor should be. I am too naïve in this craft to even speak about it but he is freaking brilliant. Yes this is Tinker tailor soldier spy meets 21 Jump Street And sometimes it has its hiccups but they are minor and the show carrie's on logically. The plot is well thought out and the dialogue well written. The cast is very good and you'll be constantly wondering what's happening next thinking that it's over only to be reprised again. Perhaps similar in vain to the old series 24 but again or British and updated. Disappointed at season one is over already.,IMDB,Gary Oldham is Brilliant,9.0

Looking forward to many more seasons and this proves British definitely do it better.

Beyond the twinset & pearls..lies a cold calculating etc .. And you've got to be doing something right to get one Sir Mick Jagger to co-write and sing the shows theme song!Season three halfway point..they may have slightly overdone Oldman's unwashed look, as it's now like he sleeps on a park bench at night before staggering into the 'spy office'.. but still a riveting watch..!",IMDB,Can't beat the British spy thriller ..done the right way.,9.0

I've watched plenty of police and/or spy dramas and I don't think any have come close to this.I've not read the book, but maybe k should. One thing is for sure, the lead actors are simply outstanding. Am loving the writing without which, actors can't do the job they do.Oldman is irrepressible as ever.

Its pacier than its earlier antecedents to allow for modern sensibilities. I watched the first series and couldn't wait for the second series so Im reading the second book in the Slough house series by Mick Heron,Dead Lions.

"Opening scene is a little laborious, but it does quickly define the story of the 'down and out' spy team and River's (Jack Lowden) place in it.

I recall Shirley's character being established as badass, which I was on board with and anxiously awaited more ass-kicking from her but she got ""lucky"" in her fight scene with a broken CD? And also, as a badass, shouldn't she have some military background or training that would prevent her from looking like she's never handled a weapon before?

"Ever wondered what happens to spies when they screw up?They end at Slough House.These are not your ""James Bond"" type spies but a collection of pen-pushers, surveillance operators and analysts - all headed up by a burnt-out ""proper"" espionage agent.The casting and performances are absolutely amazing!Gary Oldman is perfect as the foul-mouthed straight-shooting disgraced agent who has zero f's to give.The scenes where he tells (to their faces) how much he despises his co-workers and how useless they are, are pure gold.Kristin Scott Thomas is the foil to Gary Oldman and is outstanding! She totally holds the show together.The kidnappers are also very, very good in rather unpleasant ways.This has gritty moments, funny moments, shocks that will make you spill your tea and heart warming moments that will make you reach for the tissues.I found the first half of the first episode quite boring - I am not a massive fan of spy films and I would have turned it off if I had something better to do - it is worth sticking with it.",IMDB,"It is hard to say what this is - apart from very, very good",8.0
"I was late arriving to this very off-beat series (this month!) and it took me a couple of episodes to get the rhythms, but once in, I binge-watched to the end of Season 3.Gary Oldman (Jackson Lamb) steals every scene he's in and the entire series. If Mick Herron, who wrote the book upon which this series is based, didn't have Oldman in mind, you'd never know it.Reportedly, showrunner Will Smith did have Jack Lowden in mind to play 'River Cartwright' and too right he was. Lowden is pitch perfect as the very complicated character he inhabits.Kristin Scott Thomas (Diana Taverner), Samuel West (Peter Judd), and Sophie Okonedo (Ingrid Tearney) play characters we have seen many times before, but they play them very well.Along for the ride is Jonathan Pryce (David Cartwright) but they don't give him enough to do. I would involve him more.The final two episodes of Season 3 devolved into French farce and frustrating stupidity and thickness, otherwise, my rating might have been an 8. But I look forward to Season 4, which I read will debut in late Fall.",IMDB,Quirky Good,7.0
"Slow Horses inevitably suffers from being compared to Tinker Tailor, and it is not. I don't think it intends to be, even when it plays with TT's esthetic.Slow Horses is very much an action fantasy intending to entertain, with just enough realism and high-ish profile deaths thrown in to lure in TT's fans. It's got some good drama bits. It's got some intrigue. Some social and political references. But it is not a character study. It's still a slightly subverted maverick genre.I suppose the most serious aspect is depicting MI5, which like any high power institution, will gravitate towards wanting to be the law onto itself, with personal ambition, power hunger and blind compliance having much higher stakes. Does it actually depict MI5? I have no idea but it definitely plays into what I would imagine MI5 is like.Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it believable?Erm... no, at least not consistently.Is it worth watching? Yes, just alter your expectations.",IMDB,That's entertainment,10.0
"""Slow Horses"" is an exceptional series that brilliantly blends gripping espionage with dark humor and complex character dynamics. The show dives deep into the world of MI5, focusing on a group of disgraced intelligence officers relegated to Slough House, a dumping ground for agents who have made career-ending mistakes.What sets ""Slow Horses"" apart is its razor-sharp writing, masterfully adapted from Mick Herron's novels, and its outstanding ensemble cast, led by the incomparable Gary Oldman. Oldman's portrayal of Jackson Lamb, the cynical, sharp-tongued head of Slough House, is nothing short of extraordinary. His performance is both gritty and unexpectedly hilarious, bringing a fresh and captivating energy to the espionage genre.The plot twists and turns with suspense and intrigue, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The show's ability to balance tension with wit is remarkable, offering moments of genuine humor amid the high-stakes drama. Each episode peels back layers of the characters, revealing the humanity and flaws behind their often messy, yet deeply relatable, lives.The series also excels in its atmospheric storytelling, with a gritty London backdrop that enhances the show's tone. The cinematography is stylish and moody, perfectly complementing the complex narratives.Overall, ""Slow Horses"" is a must-watch for anyone who loves intelligent, character-driven stories with a touch of dark humor. It's not just another spy drama; it's a sharp, brilliantly executed series that keeps you hooked from the first episode. Highly recommended!",IMDB,Excellent,9.0
"High brow British spy stuff, starring a low brow Gary Oldman as a disgraced MI5 guy leading a bunch of misfits that all still have something to offer the service.

"I appreciate people have very different tastes - we like different things. But some of these comments (as is often the case online) cross the line from expressing a point of view to being downright aggressive and cruel (a bit like the title of this review)! People are on the receiving end of your reviews, so be kind!As for this show, I thought it was excellent entertainment. And that's what it is meant to be: entertainment. It's not history. It's not a drama doc. It's not a statement of Britain's position in international information gathering.To appreciate this show, I think you need to understand irony, which runs deep in this comedic spy caper. It's Brits laughing at ourselves. It's Brits poking fun at the establishment. It's Brits enjoying seeing the ""underdog"" triumph over the smug, privileged and powerful. It's all that and more.So, sit back, enjoy excellent acting, a tight script with so many jokes coming so fast that you might miss them, and something that offers a typically British counterpoint to the glossy ""24"", ""The Americans"" et al spy genre that tends to originate in the USA (not that I'm against them, they have their place too).For me, it lost 2 stars because I felt the final episode was rather predictable and more improbable than the show deserved.",IMDB,What a load of miserable gits inhabit these reviews!,10.0
"This has it all, action, tension, espionage but above all else humour, and it's that humour that sets it apart from the rest.It's done in such a way that your initial thought is that it's a tongue in cheek parody, but it isn't. The stuff that's going on is deadly serious.All the characters are fabulous, but in Oldmans Jackson Lamb you have someone who is destined to ho down in TV folklore in the same ilk as Walter White, Del Boy and Gene Hunt. Its a stupendous performance of someone who is undoubtedly and unapologetically the biggest slob in the world, and yet is utterly astute, clever and deadly, and God do I love him. He holds it all together, directing his band of reject spies through complex and dangerous situations with total disdain (but we know underneath he really cares about winning).I've tried reading the books on which this is based, but just couldn't get into them for some reason, but it doesn't matter. Fans if the books seem to also be fans of the show.If you want something that's a bit different from the norm these days, with a lesson in character development from a true master of his craft, then give this a go, it won't disappoint.",IMDB,Brilliant,9.0
"Loved the characters in the first Series but the story was ruined by incredibly annoying bad guys and an incompetent hostage. Series 2 was a step up, which was genuinely terrifying thanks to the unstoppable Russian, but it's series 3 that brings everything to a satisfying conclusion with four semi-regular a-holes removed from the chessboard. I was at the edge of my seat wondering if any of the slow horses would survive this time around. River gets his head handed to him from start to finish and is the antithesis of the typical hero. I adore the current roster (never liked Min), particularly the scrappy cocaine user. Series 3 is the best season of any show I've watched in awhile and I was terrified of what would happen in the last two episodes. Unlike any movie I've watched in the last 5 years, there was a real palpable tension and danger at the end, considering the track record of the team. I hope series 4 is better or as good!",IMDB,Series 3 was near perfect!,9.0
Brilliant series. Can't wait for the third series. This series was worth the admission price just to see an acting master class from Gary Oldman alone. He is brilliant in pretty much everything he has appeared in and clearly relishes this role. The story requires a bit of suspension of disbelief but generally the story and writing is interesting and engaging. Acting is excellent and the pace is good with plenty of laughs along the way. Enjoy how this British series doesn't spell everything out and requires you to concentrate on the story. Each episode keeps you engaged and looking forward to the next. Excellent!,IMDB,Brilliant and engaging spy series.,6.0
"I hear this is based on a book, which I might read instead of watching the rest of this.The pacing is good, the atmosphere is dialled in perfectly, and there are a few characters who definitely have more interesting stories to tell as the story progresses. I enjoyed the first half hour of the first episode, but then the wheels started to come off when right-of-center social issues get lumped in with right wing extremism. It really jumped the shark later when it completely inverted the current political reality in the UK.I get it. It's fiction. But when a show is presented to me as a realistic depiction of reality only to then wildly deviate from reality, I can't help it pulling me out of the show. The series narrative makes as much sense as a show about the Mormons secretly being an international drug smuggling operation. Sure, it'll work, but I'd expect that show to be a comedy and not a serious series about the intelligence community.I'm just left with the impression the show is trying to inform my beliefs instead of entertain me. It could have been an exciting story of an underdog group of agents uncovering a corporate or government conspiracy, but it just turned out to be a lecture on how I'm a bad person for not going along with the current establishment line.",IMDB,"Clever, likeable characters, well written.

"The strength of ""Slow Horses"" lies in its intriguing narrative, blending elements of espionage, mystery, and dark humor. The series manages to balance a serious tone with moments of wit, creating a distinctive atmosphere that sets it apart from conventional spy dramas. Mick Herron's source material is translated effectively onto the screen, capturing the essence of his acclaimed novels.One of the standout aspects of the series is the character development. Each ""slow horse"" has a unique backstory and distinct personality, contributing to a diverse ensemble cast. Gary Oldman's portrayal of Jackson Lamb is a highlight, bringing a gruff charm to the unconventional leader of Slough House. The dynamics among the characters add depth to the storytelling, exploring themes of redemption, trust, and the consequences of past actions.The production values of ""Slow Horses"" are commendable, with well-executed cinematography and a soundtrack that complements the tension-filled moments. The show's pacing keeps viewers engaged, striking a balance between plot progression and character exploration. The episodes are crafted with a meticulous attention to detail, creating a visually appealing and immersive experience for the audience.The show doesn't shy away from exploring the moral ambiguity of espionage, presenting a gritty and realistic portrayal of the intelligence world.In conclusion, ""Slow Horses"" stands out as a compelling addition to the spy genre. Its well-developed characters, intricate plot, and a blend of dark humor make it a refreshing take on traditional espionage narratives. The series succeeds in capturing the essence of Mick Herron's novels, appealing to both fans of the source material and newcomers alike.",IMDB,Slow horses become race horse,7.0
"Nigel Spencer:
A very un-American treat...till now. Anyone who likes Charlie Muffin will love this.So far, the series is incredibly good and remarkably true to the novels, even to the point of being filmed in the ""actual"" locale discovered by author Mick Herron, one of the few masters of this genre not really having lived as a spy himself (well probably, possibly). Jackson Lamb is delicious and represents a side of us all we would probably love to act out and even nurture.OK, I would, in any case.Gary Oldman is obviously enjoying himself hugely as the man we all hate to love. There are two basic mistakes here though:
first, Roddy Ho is more of a nasty egomaniac and less of a goofy closet superhero (totally out of touch with reality) than he is in the books;
secondly, the wonderfully explosively psychotic and sugar-bingeing Shirley Dander from the books is nowhere to be found in the lightweight underwhelming version of her character we are presented with onscreen.Archetypes anyone?They are part of the deep, unspoken power of these novels.Lady Die (Taverner) is the flip-side of the original Lady Di. The former is calculating, cold-blooded and unscrupulous, where the latter was spontaneous, sensitive and vulnerable.Lamb, on the other hand, is a part of ourselves we are longing to let loose on the world: apparently chaotic, blind, unthinking and invulnerable, yet oh so shrewd. He's our Dyonisian side, as is Shirley (only as she appears in the books though). The original Shirley is so far off the rails, she wouldn't know them if she tripped over them and upchucked the cocaine and sugar she's been bingeing on. Unfortunately her side of the triangle has basically been trashed by writer Will Smith. Mick Herron knew what he was doing when he created her for the books though.One word of caution: the final episode of Season Three also gets very violent, American-style, and we can only hope this does not bode ill for Season Four. Unfortunately, feedback from audiences who haven't read the novels and are addicted to computer-assisted superviolence in their movies may pressure the team into delivering a more violent and sensationalist version such as we are accustomed to in American films. Let's hope not.Does anyone remember what robots, computers and Americans did to Pennyworth?",IMDB,A very un-American treat...till now.,5.0
"When I was a student I used to hate the far right and thought communism and the installed Karl Marx was cool. Then I forgot all about it until C19 and the CCP agenda kicked in, and along with it a host of tell a vision series promoting far left and damming the far right. Long story short, this kind of entertainment is a form of MK ultra; seeping into people's consciousness through the back door, creating the kind of 'woke' mentality that got us into trouble in the first place. It's kinda predictable. Also, why do all cut out racist's have bitter working class accents when most if not all are minted masons. We know it's all inverted though right!? Truly, although Oldman (who is owned) owns this; it presents a patronising tone that assumes people believe whatever they are told - one word and your a racist!

"It's tough to write 600 characters about a show that pretty much can be summed up with the above headline, but given that to write a review for IMBD, you now have to hit their character count, here are the things that make this show so good: The writing, the direction, but above all, the acting. Everyone is superb, but Gary Oldman gives the kind of bravura performance you rarely see these days; he plays someone you can't stand and yet you also want to see more of him. Hard to pull off. Jack Lowden is able to pull off another trick: the young hero, he's the least interesting character given that young heros are seldom the best, but he has more than enough charisma to pull off the role perfectly. The others are all good, but special kudos to the always underused Saskia Reeves, who is just perfect in her role, and, perhaps most of all, Brian Vernel, who seems like he was born to play villains, and he does it with panache.Given the snappy direction, fast paced action, and spot-on dialog, and it's a 10 star show.",IMDB,An excellent show from beginning to end,9.0

The car with the bomb scene? As if they would not sweep that car first in search of whatever but instead just park it nicely back inside. The gasoline station scene? The guy asking multiple times (for 'dramatic reasons') to the customer ""what number?"" when he can clearly see there's just 1 (one!) car left.

"Mick Herron's writing is world class. However, for my taste the writing is just that little bit drawn out - a bit too descriptive. I can imagine others liking that slow burn and change of pace but it is not for me. This adaptation, which wraps up long descriptions so that they are absorbed quickly through imagery; with many pictures each cutting thousands of words from my life without loss of story-telling power, should be great. Moreover, Gary Oldman, who plays the Lamb character so well, should also server make this absurdly great. And it would be great if it wasn't for a single ingredient that didn't need to be added but has an old school chap like me screaming at disgust at the TV. Increasingly - and by season three I am actively cringing - there is too much in the way of ""Reaching out"" and ""Can I get ..."" and ""I feel like..."" modern Americanisms that make the stories, which are set in the MI5 world, a little less British and a whole lot more cloying and less believable. The characters seem to become childlike spys, who are not always in keeping with the character writing, at least not by my interpretation. Also the 'writer'-producers seem to think they can improve on Herron and so change the story in ways that seem ... silly. Presumably this is to attract new audiences. However, to my mind it risks putting current ones off.",IMDB,Good digest of the books - but with a touch of cringeworthy nonsense,6.0

I've come to expect more out of this show based off the first two seasons. Season 3 (especially the finale) was like watching a predictable 80s action movie. I know it's supposed to be entertaining television, but these cliches were too frequent to ignore. The show is a spy thriller grounded in today's reality...during the finale of season 3 I felt like I was one step away from seeing someone's shoe laces tied together so they couldn't run away. Typically, this show balances suspense, tension, and humor very well. I can get on board with some of the less realistic sequences because the cast carries the story so well. Gary Oldmans character is a treat every time he is on screen. Season 3 tanked in my opinion. It started off well enough, but the writing just got progressively lazy.

"It is staggering how few people have watched this series. Everyone I know who has devoured it (because binge on this you will) universally agrees it's the best TV series they've seen. Arguably ever.What is unarguable for me is how Gary Oldman is the finest actor of his generation. He is an incredibly versatile character actor, a walking tour de force who brings every ounce of his immense yet understated genius to his portrayal of Jackson Lamb.And, though he is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown, he is not out of place here. The scripts are sensational. The characters well drawn and entirely plausible. The plots are at once exciting and slow-burning, with a healthy admixture of action scenes. The dysfunction it places at the heart of MI5, Britain's domestic intelligence service, is the consummate contraposition of James Bond's slick MI6.Where Bond is bravado and machismo, Lamb is lumbago and impetigo. He is a bully and a misery but a hugely likeable character nonetheless, thanks to his ready, acerbic wit. His devil-may-care approach to his art lends him familiar commonalities with Bond. This is as if Connery's Bond went on too long and grew to hate his work and the world.The narcissism of the careerist higher-ups feels apt, and nicely portrayed by Krisitin Scott Thomas and Sophie Okonedo, who give us more rounded, better developed figures than Dame Judi Dench's task-focused M.Then there are the Slow Horses themselves.

But I later went back to see if I would like it better, knowing when to preemptively mute the blazing rifles (""it's not a gun; it's a rifle"") and upon my third watch, I was no longer startled when all the noise started again, although I did have to lower the volume each time.The theme song ""Strange Game"" is also the best ever. I have not been so impressed by Mick Jagger since his earliest efforts in the 1960's. I refuse to skip either the intro or the credits, just to hear the song.Not only is Gary Oldman always incredible in the lead, but all of the actors are excellent.

Then I knew Oldman was in it, but got a bonus with Jonathan Pryce! I was hooked.The first season played like a La Carre styled story with even Pryce mentioning Smiley at the end!

But the story continued to engage, plus acting, directing and overall style remained; which kept me watching intently.In fact, I haven't ""binged"" on a tv show in over ten years, but I found myself unable to watch just one. I kept my cool and never watched more than three in a row, but it was hard to not keep going!Fantastic show for those that are tired of overblown ridiculous superheroes and magical detectives that seem to permeate a lot of the recent wave of tv shows not only just in Murica but everywhere. Fresh and real (despite some overblown story elements).",IMDB,absolutely must see tv,9.0
"One of my favorite podcasters (Laura Richards from True Crime profile) gave this a rec in an episode. I'd never heard of it, and Brit productions aren't always my cup of tea, but this show is fantastic! We've loved it pretty much from the first episode. The characters are really well developed, the actors are amazing and perfectly cast (especially Jackson, Diana and Big Rod - everyone in it is great though); sometimes it is a tad predictable but not ridiculously so. It has a lot of humor, without being over the top, and unexpected plot twists. Right now it's the only thing keeping us subscribed to Apple TV - here's hoping season 4 comes out SOON! If not, we'll probably do a rewatch because the show is that good! Usually in a series there are one or two turkey episodes that are throwaways, but not here.",IMDB,"Interesting characters, outstanding writing and acting",10.0
"Absolutely loved this show and it hasn't dropped its standards over the 3 seasons so far, it's actually gotten better. Must watch show! Acting is superb from everyone and the plots are so good, not predictable like so many others. In a time where TV shows are better than movies this series definitely stands out from the crowd for me. Love Gary Oldman as Jackson Lamb, plays the character perfectly from his sarcastic humour to his cunning methods and surprises...
I also love that the show has such good material that they didn't need many big name actors to attract attention. Apple have had a good few shows out in recent times that I've liked but this is definitely their best so far.",IMDB,Brilliant! Especially Jackson Lamb,9.0
"I'm two seasons down (apologies for not signing up to Apple sooner, even though it has its many faults).This is genius.You know when you used to go into old pubs and they smelled of stale lamb chops? I imagine that's what Lamb smells like. Stale booze, stale fag smoke, some weird lamb chop smell. And not because his name is Lamb, actually maybe that's why his name is Lamb?Gary Oldman is absolutely stellar. I hope he brushes his teeth in real life.The rest of the cast are on point too.The stories are far-fetched enough to have you going, what? But realistic enough for you to think, well, yeah. And it's all fun and exciting. Except for the characters who die, obviously.Get watching this if you haven't already.",IMDB,Solid,10.0

"Didn't care much for the book, but this series was brilliant. God plot and writing. Excellent acting. Excellent casting. It's not le Carre, nothing elegant about it with his intelligent players.

You would think that Oldman should totally dominate the show, but others got to shine too. Thankfully! Looking forward to season 2.",IMDB,Brilliant.,9.0

"Gary Oldman is truly one of the all time great actors, always on top of his game in every role, no matter the movie. Doesn't matter if the script is bad, or the plot is off, Gary delivers, always has, always will. Or did we just turn the tide on that one?This series starts off OK, the mystery keeps the plot going through the first two episodes. The tension is there, and you are a bit on the edge of your seat wondering where this is going. But then, half way past episode 3, you really start to notice that this plot is absolutely improbable.When i was done with episode 4, i was shaking my head in disbelief, and after episode 5 i was almost puking. This show makes every mistake known to man, except actually putting ""academy award winner Gary Oldman"" on the poster.The script is terrible, the characters are stereotypical, the plot completely off rails, the story is predictable and lazy, the editing is uninspired, the directing is completely by the book.By episode 5, Oldman is trying his best to keep his character plausible and relevant in this rather impossible plot, but you can clearly see he isn't up for the task, and that's saying something, when we are talking about one of the greatest character actors that has ever lived.I really wished this show was great, but instead it's simply bad. Two first episodes felt like a 7/10, it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either, it was good, and i hoped it with start to climb as the plot thickened. But instead it all falls apart and goes downhill with impossible plot twists, bad writing, countless clichés , and the show just tumbles over the edge and gains momentum into the abyss.The writers of this show thought that creating an endless amount of coincidences could make their story plausible, they were wrong.3/10 - Bad.",IMDB,"Starts off ok, then it's downhill",3.0
"Gary Oldman is brilliant in everything he does and he shines in this series about an outcast bunch of spooks working in a derelict building in London.The storylines are great, with a deep, unpredictable, twisting plot filmed well and acted well by everyone.The story covers an infrequently covered topic - MI5 and their shenanigans, more often than not putting internal politics ahead of the health and safety of the British public.Locations are lovely as well: beautiful hotels, houses, corporate meeting rooms, lovely Cotswold villages as well as seedy restaurants and office buildings.This is classic British TV with a feast of a plot and a light tasting of car chases, special effects and sex, rather than the reverse typically exported from across the Pond.",IMDB,Outstanding Spook series,9.0
I had plans for today being my day off and that all went to hell after watching the first episode. Gary Oldman is great and never seems to peak with each new project. His supporting cast hold their own with the best of them. Great spy story that's not dry and typical but has a real human element from all the characters. Good and bad.,IMDB,Marathon after first episode,10.0
"The pace and story line of this series is so good, it clips along as a good movie.Spies, good guys, bad guys - who is who? Who owes a favour? Was your friend still a friend?Gary Oldman is fabulous as this tatty, grubby, seemingly washed up head of the dregs that have fallen from grace from the great British espy institution for some reason or another.The characters are well developed with a very good cast.Most enjoyable are edge-of-the-seat moments and not so predictable outcomes.One of the best crime series in a long time. Oldman deserves more accolades for his performance. The show runners have done a good job on this one.",IMDB,Gary Oldman at His Finest,10.0

"Just finished washing the first series of episodes where Gary Oldman plays the worst pain in the arse spy boss anyone could ever have, with utter contempt for everyone who gets closer than 3 m. But because everybody is used to cutting everyone else down, nobody cares about being rundown by him or anyone else in the cast off spy group he runs. Apart from the dumbing down of everyone, it is a surprisingly good realistic story about British nationalism, race hatred and espionage secrets that could take down the highest of people running the country.Now and then there are a couple of blips in the storyline and action scenes, but because everything else has put together so good, it's quickly forgotten.Can't wait to start watching the rest of the series.",IMDB,Top of the range series,10.0

"This stellar drama thriller, starring some high class actors, is definitely deserving of all the praise it has gotten.I have watched a vast number of films and TV shows from all countries and eras, but this is most definitely one of the better.

"Picked this up for Gary Oldman who still delivers. I think that was the intent with the promotion because you couldn't make the main character interesting even with a highly edited trailer. Seriously, go look up the one where it's all the actors talking about the show. As the clearly the main character who gets by far the most screen time, he is the fourth talk and tied for least time in the promo with the third tier characters which is entirely praising Gary Oldman and saying nothing about show. It's like they all know he is untenable but keep pushing through anyway. Just bizarre.The main protagonist, though you wouldn't know it from the promos, is an incompetent, pissy child with delusions of grandeur who, were he a real life person, would be universally loathed by all who interacted with him instead of anemically hated by one or two as he is in the show. Entirely impossible to get behind. This would be bad enough but then the writers distort the reality of the show to justify his delusions and try to make him believable as a mistreated, under-appreciated yet secretly talented MI5 agent only to further compound their ridiculousness in trying to do so.What's more is in the reality warping they assume audience members are similarly stupid as the characters they write and won't be able to remember what they saw five minutes ago or what we all know from life in general. Examples to follow.In the first seen he is running through an airport after an unaware target. If he had ran silently through the ample spaces around everyone he observably would have caught up the target but instead he pushes and runs into everyone he can like he is a 2d video game character who can't access the 3rd dimension while screaming ""Move! Move! Move!"" This alerts the target who then also begins to run so that the protagonist does not catch up with target as he certainly should have.This like a spy does, right?Super loud and obvious.Yet after showing you this profound idiocy they play it off like he was the victim of another agent's scheming which at best was a necessary but insufficient for the protagonist to fail.A little while later he shorts an electrical safe box by wrapping a wet cloth around his hand and prying at it. Let's pretend for the moment water could short the lock as shown and further pretend that shorting the lock would open it, but why in God's name would he need to use the water to conduct the current directly into his hand for an electrical burn?This is like spy tech is built right?Easily circumvented for the cost of a shock to the hand (provided you are real ignorant and don't know who to accomplish the exact same effect without pointlessly injuring yourself).But again the show acts like this is a standard practice for getting into such boxes as everyone instantly recognizes precisely how he hurt his hand. This is made even more inane by the creatives because there is nothing visible on his hand so that they are either miming what should be a visible burn like an improv group pretending they see something or similarly pretending there is something in the way he uses his hand that overtly betrays an injury.Then a right wing group kidnaps someone. The protagonist starts with, ""Hey, this guy that we were monitoring was part of a different right wing group. Bet they are connected."" Which is like learning the Twins going the World Series and assuming explicitly because of that that the Astros are also going because they are also a baseball team.This is like spies do right?Free association and wild conjecture.But yet again the show warps its universe so that he is crack on.I would say this is the worst and most absurd British suspense series that I have ever seen, but I did see the Bodyguard on Netflix which is deliberately incoherent whereas Slow Horses is just stupid and lazy.If you watch it as an absurdist dark comedy it is serviceable, hence 4 stars. But it was billed and reviewed as a Spy Drama as which it completely fails.",IMDB,Slow being the operative word. As in the main character. (spoilers are only for the first episode but emblematic of the rest)),4.0
"Very good spy drama with echos of John le Carré, The Smiley role is taken by Gary Oldman's character played as foul slob rather than english gent, he is very good in the role, and whilst it never gets to the cerebral challenge of the John le Carré novels, its far easier to join the dots, its still quite good drama, where it does fail a bit for me is that it goes a bit A team in the end, with ineffectual automatic weapons fire and explosions with characters wearing plot armour. Lambs seeming omnipotence sometimes stretches credibility, Looking forward to S4 though and hoping its not going to be doing any shark jumping.",IMDB,Bingeable brit Spy drama,8.0

I'm just 30 minutes into the first episode and I am completely blown away with the skill of the author AND the of actors.

The intrigue, pacing, and dialogue all raise the bar for what television can be.This is not a series that you can watch passively. You MUST pay attention. There's a lot of moving parts.

"I now live in Australia and don't keep up with too many British shows sadly. Due to my wonderful Scottish neighbour suggesting a few things of late I also stumbled upon this gem. Wow I had some LOL moments.Oh by the way I'm only up to S2 E2 as of now, Feb 2024. Had a big laugh at a certain funeral ( forgive me ) when they played his ''favourite song''. Haha. And my goodness us Brits just have the best sarcasm, something that is often seen as offensive in other countries and something that I have probably toned down after 30 years here. I mean it never fully leaves you of course.I think I'm going to start watching a lot more British shows in the foreseeable future that's for sure. And I have been a fan of Gary Oldman for decades, and what a part he plays in this. So refreshing to see such great acting that leads you to kinda forget that they're actors acting.

"Everything about this series is a relief.A relief because I am not watching while wondering why they cast this person, why the writing is questionable, why the dialog doesn't make sense, etc., etc.It is quick, it is timely, it is hilarious - yet, in its own way, serious.I am a fan of espionage and intelligence stories, unfortunately I find most to be a bit too common in their grasp of the politics. It has been awhile since I finished the third season, and there may have been a few references to Cold War politics, anti-Russia stuff, that were a bit naive, but I guess they have to appeal to everyone. Whatever they were, they weren't so bad that I can recall what they were.The production hits the mark on every level as far as I am concerned. It keeps me interested, it doesn't overdo suspense with gimmicks, and, it makes me laugh outloud.The theme song: goes without saying.",IMDB,"Really, the best.",10.0

"In my reviews here, I have many times pointed out the extraordinary number of fresh series that deliver the goods in S01 and then run dry by the end of S02. In other words, the producers welcomed the cash flow from the renewal, but were plain out of ideas. My guess is that over 70% of all streaming series suffer from this fate. The good news is that SLOW HORSES is not one of them. While the casting and production value of the series is great, the writing here is truly EXTRAORDINARY. Did the writing hold up for the second season? READ THE ROOM! -- to quote a killer line of dialog from S01 -- yes it did.

"It's a drag that this collection of talent is messed by weak writing with Swiss cheese holes in the end of the 2nd season.Oldman and Thomas, as expected, are both strong in the parts. Though Oldman does have a meatier part.His subtlety is just so great to watch.The standout surprises are Saskia Reeves, who has been around for some time, though I'd not heard of her on these shores.And Rosalind Eleazer. She steals scene with just her eye reactions. Her focus is that what you'd expect from a spy.S02E4 has a weak ending that is carried into and thru E06. Still very watchable, but I hope things tighten up for next season.Music is in the background where it should be and no pop songs, unlike the irritation of Alias.",IMDB,started off so strong,7.0
"Season 1 was good and the cast excellent. Season 2 dropped fractionally but only in plot.. Season 3 is back at to excellent.When you know you have a cast of the quality of Slow Horses you'd hope that the writing, directing and production live up to their talent. Slow Horses does not disappoint.Taken from the books (written by Mick Herron) this follows a group of 'misfits' from the UK's Intelligence Services, each of whom has been sidelined into dead-end roles for various individual 'mis-deeds'. Based in the forgotten Slough House (hence Slow Horses) and led by their jaded and politically incorrect 'old-hand', Jackson Lamb (played excellently by Gary Oldman) these misfits find themselves at the heart of various plots and political power-plays, usually where they are the expendable pawns.Great acting by all, good characterisation and production values, with compelling, witty and unconventional script and storylines. This is a genuinely enjoyable watch, and the sadness is that Herron only wrote 6 (from memory) books! Sad face.",IMDB,"Excellent, witty and enjoyable adaptation of the equally good books.",10.0
"Overall, I enjoyed this - but the plot and actions of MI5, the ""slow horses"" and the terrorists started to become a little silly in the final two episodes.Oldman was great, but some of the comedic aspects between the other group members felt misplaced. The scene where they ran out of petrol, for instance, was just ridiculous.When it played it more serious, especially around the shady shenanigans of MI5, it was pretty strong and hopefully this might be explored more in the 2nd season (which looks like it was filmed back to back)",IMDB,Worth watching for Oldman on his own,7.0
"First, I absolutely loved the first Season of Slow Horses.I think I gave the 1st season a 9. The ensemble cast is terrific.

To do this in 6 episodes is great writing!Second, IT IS MORE RARE that a second Season is EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST! GIVING THIS Season a 10.Gary Oldman as the ornery Leader of the misfit MI-5 Agents at Slough House is SPOT ON. His one liners are sometimes so shocking but his team don't blink an eye. They know they're all at Slough House because they have done something bad or wrong and have been banished to work for the infamous Jackson Lamb. Instead of being fired the Agents on his team are relegated to work at Slough House.No Spoilers here but sufficed to say the writing is so clever.

A group of labelled second rate agents exiled to work at the slough house, the office where the rejects and screw ups are sent under the guidance of the crude Jackson Lamb, brilliantly portrayed by Gary Oldman.

"River Cartwright (Jack Lowden) is fantastic at grabbing the viewer's attention. The first ten thrilling minutes were a reminder that I was still hungry for the days of Jack Bauer. Slow Horses is a return to spy thriller TV with a healthy balance of drama and action. The actors, writers, and showrunners created a show that offers a sophisticated Mission Impossible (1966 TV series) feel and the dark and violent physical force of '24'. Where it differs from other spy thrillers is that the story centers on what I can best describe as the D-team. A true underdog story wrapped in a whodunnit.

They really succeed most of the time to walk the line of dramedy with suspense you want to uncover. Although its mainly visually procedural, it has its moment of brillance in the staging and photography. It makes it standout and less boring, while offering fun hint of old school spy vibe.But you come back for the characters. Sure they're a bit cliches, but they are well written cliches. They don't feel cheap. They're just fun to watch.

"Look here I don't write reviews. Ever. I just bingewatched season 3 and it took me a while to get around to it considering I enjoyed (what I remember) of season 1 & 2. The reviews of people saying season 3 tanked are accurate. It was cool up to the end of episode three and they're pros at hooks but this nosedived. I could've been a consultant on the set and I have zero military experience. From inconsistent shots when the rain wasn't showing up in the background to the wallpaper in episode one of the ""apartment hotel"" whatever it was. I could tell something was off from episode one and I couldn't put my finger on it until end of episode 3. This was a thoughtful series that I won't watch anymore of. Some of the casting solid, the acting solid. The humor sometimes way out of place especially in real moments. I don't think they've established accurate rules in the world they're story telling in.

This show has the it factor. Plot is intriguing and has several unexpected twists. Overall really good acting and the characters follow their own path/vibe through out the series. The first season is the strongest one for aure. It has a depth that the other two are lacking. Even if all of them are watch worthy.Not a reason why I like this show but I appreciate that there are so many strong female characters throughout the series.Script is great and very funny at times. I really enjoyed watching this show and hope there will be another season.The main character Jackson Lamb is my favorite.,IMDB,It's a yes !,8.0
"This is not a bad show, but it's too comedic to be classed as a real Spy Thriller. I read someone call this 'the best TV spy series' which is quite absurd to say the least. The show is OK for a less serious watch, but really lacks any real depth or substance to captivate actual emotion. I found myself losing interest or being too bothered about what actually happens during most episodes. Almost every scene someone is trying to be overly funny or silly & it just takes away the ability to feel a real connection towards the characters.The majority of the acting is very comedic, surface level stuff - I can't think of a single scene out of all three seasons which has captured any raw emotion or award winning performances, although I'd probably say the best performance throughout the series was from Saskia Reeves (Standish). But if you compare the acting to some of the performances from the likes of Homeland, The Americans, The Bureau; then Slow Horses falls far short.If you want a more serious & realistic Spy series with an insight into how actual espionage works without mostly fighting shooting & explosions, I'd recommend watching the French series 'The Bureau', which is miles ahead of this.",IMDB,Not bad - 6.5/10,6.0
"When the action of the opening scene dies down this story turns into a slow burn. The actors are all fairly good and there is enough suspense to keep the interest level high. I watched the two episodes back to back and the characters are an enjoyable bunch with a bit of drama.Gary Oldman is his usual grumpy old guy self and he does what he does. The lead character River does a decent job of keeping us entertained and in a show with everyone having character flaws they are quite adept at revealing them in creative ways.The overall story isn't all that exciting, but the actors do their best with what's on the script. It's not as action heavy as the Condor series but good enough to keep watching for now.After making it to eps 3, it's gotten progressively worse since the pilot. Orig rating was a 6, now a 4 and I'm done. Lots of mumbling and bumbling around by two different departments. Nobody wants to see Gary Oldman being a complete ass over and over. The initial 5 minutes in the pilot, all action, is very misleading now as it's all a long drawn out story with little if any action at all.I really wanted to like this, but there's nothing there to like. No intriguing story, no good characters, no intense drama. Paint by numbers show.",IMDB,"Interesting set of misfits, loses lustre rather quickly",4.0

Meanwhile you can feel the growing sense of threat off screen as they and their world edge closer to disaster.When everything comes crashing down you feel it all the more keenly because the time has been taken to make the threat so much more meaningful.As everyone else has said, the cast are terrific. Also key is that the off-centre and off-beat spy world world they inhabit gives them every chance to shine.On occasion this series veers towards unbelievability, which punctures its general excellence.

I thought I had already left a 7 or 8 star review after the first series but something must have told me there was more to come and I was delighted to watch the second ( of many more ) release of one of the finest BRITISH drama series I have seen in a long time . Gary Oldmans BRAVURA PERFORMANCE in the lead role is a mixture of the great Sir Alec Guinnesses portrayal of George Smiley and Alfred Burkes ground breaking detective in Public Eye ( would love to see some repeats of that instead of the usual tripe ) and he is surrounded by an admirably portrayed band of misfits who each perfectly fulfill their varied and essential roles. Reminiscent of some of the best of the BBC productions back in the day when they screened THE REAL TOP GEAR and did not have the timerity to banish STEVE WRIGHT IN THE AFTERNOON from our airwaves . Shame on the BBC AND WELL DONE APPLE ..... PLEASE GIVE US MORE.,IMDB,MY FIRST 9 STAR REVIEW ... EXCELLENT,9.0
"I was thoroughly impressed by the compelling storyline and exceptional performances from the cast. This series follows a group of misfit MI5 agents working in the Slough House, a division for those who have messed up in their careers. Despite their flaws and setbacks, the team comes together to solve complex and dangerous cases with wit, determination, and a bit of humor.The characters are dynamic and well-developed, each with their own distinct personality and backstories that add depth to the show. The performances from the actors, particularly Nathan Stewart-Jarrett as the sarcastic and quick-witted Jackson Lamb, are top-notch and bring the characters to life.The plot is fast-paced and full of twists and turns, keeping me on the edge of my seat and eager to see what happens next. The writing is sharp and the dialogue is clever and witty, adding to the overall enjoyment of the show.Overall, ""Slow Horses"" is a must-see for fans of espionage and drama.

"With the exception of the acting, Apple serves up another disaster. Totally unoriginal MI5 cliché. Poorly directed, poorly paced, un realistic, mediocre cinematography. Overtly and emphatically politically biased writing (even though there is nothing wrong with right wing extremists taking their turn at being the bad guys). Apple proves once again that the first season of Ted Lasso was a fluke.",IMDB,Deja Vue all over again,6.0

"It is about time there was a a refreshing anti hero series. This has been one of the best series shown for years, a completely different approach to the main stream crime shows. Jackson Lamb reminds me of Dalziel, a similarly dry, shrewd but crude detective, in this case agent. I cannot recommend this show highly enough. Well done to the writers, directors but especially Gary Oldman. His acting is excellent, a complete world away from his role in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. His lovable rogue belies integrity and true support for his group of dejected and rejected spies. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed.",IMDB,Simply fantastic TV,7.0
"I think that the main characters are all well defined and they acted their parts well and the show has a decent plot.But in parts the dialogue went a bit creaky and there was some distinctly wooden acting from two or three of the subsidiary characters which was rather grating.Excellent intro and outro song.Addendum - I enjoyed series 2 more than the first one, it is really finding it's stride. Some great performances all round.",IMDB,Overall very good but some imperfections,5.0
"The writing is cheesy and so is the directing. Oldmans character is fantastic but the story and cliches are awful and the direction is completely off as well. When a certain character yells ""he should stand trial"" in episode six, I'd had enough.It's not all bad though and is a bit entertaining but for those looking for Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy, this ain't it.",IMDB,Oldman makes it watchable but it feels like 15 year olds made this.,8.0
"A good series based on novels of the same name.Good production values, consistently excellent acting performances, and intricate plotting.The best part of this series are the deeply detailed backstories for the central characters, in particular River Cartwright (Jack Lowden) and Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman). The team at Slough House (Slow Horses) is comprised with MI5 screw ups, with Lamb as the boss, the biggest Pariah of them all. Standish, a dowdy older woman with her own troubled past, is the administrative glue that keeps the shabby office chugging along, and Lamb shuffling on to his next assignment. Kristin Scott Thomas, delivering her standard one note stoic performance, is perfectly suited as the amoral ladder climbing political backstabber working second desk at MI5.The cases have intricate plotting in season one and two. Season three is a bit of a mess. A terrifying event threatens one of Slough House's own, there's a giant red herring, derring-do by the team's stereotypical sociopathic computer nerd, a guns-a-blazing firefight with over a dozen heavily armed assassins, and political gaslighting. But it's all too implausible, with the slow horses somehow conjuring up spy craft skills and weaponry to win out. The first two seasons use more carefully crafted stories to peel back the layers of the central characters' pasts. And despite the ""Slow Horse"" label these misfits work under, they ALWAYS seem to figure things out. Faster horses than their political bosses suspected.There are plot holes aplenty and internal world logic that is inconsistent. River, having screwed up a training exercise, is banished to Slough House, but still manages to be thrust into the middle of important events, supposedly because of his legendary MI5 grandfather's legacy. The other misfit agents are either more certifiably incompetent (leaving top secret files on a public transit) or clear liabilities (drug addict who gets high on the job; gambling addict who uses company time to place bets) but nevertheless are entrusted to handle affairs that get people killed. But despite all of those limitations, they're continually involved in cases where there are high stakes. Doesn't make sense, but sure is fun to watch.What I like most about this show is the commitment to character. Lamb is a misanthrope who is unredeemable, and the screenplay doesn't stoop to sentimentality when he engages with others. He's always inappropriate and insensitive, even when a moment seems to call for a possible kind word. River is a kind-hearted soul, conflicted by his family history and always reaching for more than he is capable of, frequently with disastrous results. He isn't bailed out by plot contrivances to emerge as a shining knight. Louisa, played by Rosalind Eleazar, is a dedicated, practical and capable agent, whose presence in Slough House is a mystery that doesn't get any attention. Her backstory in the first three seasons is relegated to her ill fated affair with Min, a coworker so incompetent and skittish that there is no question as to why he works with the castoffs.I recommend this show highly for the acting, production quality and some interesting spy stories.",IMDB,Faster Horses,9.0
"""Slow Horses"" is a masterclass in espionage drama, brilliantly reinvigorating the genre with a blend of sharp wit and thrilling suspense. The series stands out for its exceptional acting, with the ensemble cast delivering performances that are as engaging as they are believable. At the forefront is Gary Oldman, whose portrayal is nothing short of phenomenal, infusing his character with a complexity and charisma that only an actor of his calibre could achieve.The show's narrative is a clever twist on the classic cold war spy thriller, seamlessly integrating modern sensibilities and humor that both pays homage to and satirizes the genre. It's this ingenious balance that makes ""Slow Horses"" not just a spy show, but a cultural commentary on the espionage world. The humor is never overplayed; instead, it's woven into the fabric of the story, enhancing the tension and providing a refreshing take on what could otherwise be a somber plot.In a television landscape often crowded with tried-and-tested formulas, ""Slow Horses"" feels like a breath of fresh air. It's a series that doesn't just entertain but also enchants its audience, leaving them eagerly anticipating each new twist and turn. With its brilliantly modernized take on spy narratives and a lead performance by Gary Oldman that will be remembered for years to come, ""Slow Horses"" is undoubtedly a standout series that will gallop into the hearts of viewers everywhere.",IMDB,A clever twist on the classic cold war spy thriller,10.0
"For me : the best spy thriller on TV .Grubby , sad , funny , full of ineptitude and selfishness: that sounds like a British Government department to me.Great performances all round.. and they are generous with each other.No silly showing off / style over substance in the telling of the story. I can hear all of the dialogue which I still consider compulsory ( but I'm old fashioned ).Plenty of dark Humour. Runs along at a decent pace but the character development is exceptional.I care about each of the characters and the loathe-some ones even offer a chance of redemption. I would still advise to read the books which are also excellent but funnier.",IMDB,As good as it gets,10.0

"There's some real cynics reviewing this one with the ""it wouldn't happen"" or ""implausible"" type comments. The fact of the matter is it's an entertainment series not a documentary. In any case the vast proportion of the general population have no idea what actually goes on in the world of MI whatever and anyone who is is highly unlikely to post a reciew! Therfore we have to take things at face value. Do that and youre in for a great ride.Once the cast are established they start developing and their history disclosed. It's an excellent cast brilliantly led by the obnoxious Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman). No spoilers but he has some brilliant lines, most delivered blunt and dry. As the characters are developed you start wondering which one the plot will be killing next or wether they will suss what's happening as they're all deemed to be sidelined failures.The plots in all3 series are very good with plenty of twists and turns.Well worth a watch.",IMDB,Entertaining and engrossing,10.0

There is absolutely no connection of that plot to the main story.",IMDB,Tries to be more complex than it is,10.0

"This show is interesting at times, but it has this thing that annoys me a lot. I find this very often in British series when they want to imprint a comedic character to many scenes. The characters are either overly emotional and awkward, or they all behave like complete a**holes. In this show, it is the second case, for each and every character. Please!Anyway...
Slow Horses is a spy series that follows a group of MI5 agents who are relegated to a dead-end department called Slough House. They are led by a cynical boss, who has a mysterious past and a disdain for authority. The series is based on the novels by Mick Herron, and features a stellar cast of actors, including Gary Oldman, Kristin Scott Thomas, Jack Lowden, and Rosalind Eleazar. The series explores the themes of loyalty, betrayal, corruption, and redemption, as the slow horses face various challenges and dangers in their line of work.So basically that's it. I think I would enjoy the show much more if it wasn't for the fake ""black humor"" consisting of each character literally behaving like crap with each other.",IMDB,Interesting but why everyone behaves like an ass?,9.0
"Excellent writing and Gary Oldman is as good as ever, I'd go as far as to say he's the greatest living British actor. Jackson Lamb is a unique character, he's about as far away from Bond as you could possibly get. If you crossed Bond with Jack Carter, threw in a bit of Malcolm Tucker and then got him to live rough for a fortnight you'd be somewhere near.It's fast enough paced for fans of the normal spy thrillers but that's where the similarities end with anything else you will have seen in the past ,The casting is spot on throughout, I think the second series was even better than the first. Bring on season 3.",IMDB,Better than Bond,10.0

"Jackson Lamb runs the MI5 division at Slough House. His team is known within MI5 as the Slow Horses: they're all there because they bungled an operation or were generally seen as unfit for front-line duty. It's either Slow Horses or leave the service. Despite their deficiencies and problems they prove themselves very resourceful.An excellent series. Quite novel, an unglamourous view of the espionage game, seen through the eyes of those that MI5 has rejected. Means we see a more analogue way of doing things as Slow Horses doesn't have the means to tackle things the way their more elite colleagues do.The plots are quite clever, unpredictable and filled with tension. They can be a bit far-fetched at times (Season 3 takes the cake here) but the tension and action make up for this.Great mix of characters too, all with decent back-stories, making for a highly engaging series. Some good humour too.Gary Oldman shines as the slobbish and unhygienic yet incredibly sharp-witted and street-smart Jackson Lamb. He is perfect in the role. Remaining cast, which includes Kristin Scott Thomas and Jonathan Pryce, is great too: nobody puts a foot wrong.Highly recommended.",IMDB,"Excellent: original, gripping, clever, engaging and witty espionage drama",9.0
"It has been a long time since I've watched a really good series. There were some hit and miss or those which are great 1 season and then they fizzles out. Very rarely it can maintain the momentum for a few seasons running. They just don't make them like how they used to anymore.Slow Horses may have some overused plot, but it is the delivery that matters. And can I just say, Gary Oldman's performance as Jackson Lamb was just beyond words, just fantastic.Granted you do have some women power element in there, but they do carry substance, with good character development. I would say every casts played their role really well, this delivering a great watch. I binged 3 seasons and am looking forward to Season 4.",IMDB,Absolutely stupendous,9.0
"I was really looking forward to this. Formidable thespians like Oldman and Scott-Thomas. High potential young actors. But then - a deliriously dumb, dumb, really dumb plotline, contrived characters taking nonsensical actions and some really cringeworthy dialogue. The diametric opposite of the awesome Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy in terms of quality and sophistication. Even found the opening theme annoying. I did make it through four eps before throwing in the towel. Feel bad for the young actors - although since alot of folks appear to somehow love this, maybe they have nothing to be concerned about,",IMDB,Ugh - great acting can't overcome Stupid plotline,6.0
"Loved it.Some great characters in it, and no surprise to see the brilliant Gary Oldman doing his thing.This is a pretty suspense filled show. It has a lovely mix of lightheartedness, seriousness, slightly fumbling, and old schoool spy drama.The city of London is a character here in itself. We are brought to high-class hotels and multimillion-pound houses, as well as council flats and backstreet businesses, all filmed with a gorgeous crispness that feels as luxurious as the casting. Slow Horses loves a shot of sunlight streaming through a gin-palace pub window, or a London park looking impossibly verdant; a conversation between Oldman and Kristin Scott Thomas, as Lamb's slippery opposite number at the proper MI5, is pleasingly shot as if the camera is floating past them along a canal. Every scene has a finesse of quality or invention.Well worth the watch.",IMDB,Very well put together,8.0
"Season 1 : 8.5/10
Season 2 : 7.5/10
Season 3 : 5/10
I genuinely enjoyed the first two seasons a lot. Fresh, well-written characters, well-timed entrances, and meaningful exits.The first two had me tense, on the edge of my seat at most times, not quite sure what was around the next corner. I do feel like towards the end of the Second season the writing began to be a bit on the wall, as well as there being a bunch of questionable choices in regards to the plot, however it remained enjoyable. The first season felt a bit like an adjacent tale in the world of Killing Eve, but more serious, a fair bit filthier, and a slightly weaker overall cast of characters.It was the more serious tone that drew me the most to the show, with a smattering of humour tossed in feeling not out of place. This seriousness fades drastically as the series progresses, and by season 3 is all but gone, along with any believability. Granted, I'm not watching for the believability, it's quite unbelievable to begin with, but it did it's due diligence with the scenes so not as to distract you, or pull you from the world as you're watching. That is until the third act.Season 3 gives us relatively flat characters, that by the end of it have lost most if not all charm, leaving you wondering why you're to watch on in season 4. Any likeability has been written out of the characters at this point for the majority of them, or they've been the same since Episode 1.Add to that a sudden burst of gun-fights which is apparently attempting, and yet failing quite hard to fill in for a lack of good writing. The last few episodes felt like they had the same gun fights going on for all 3 episodes... which mainly consisted of a room full of highly trained individuals unable to shoot people taking cover behind bookshelves that had no back to them. Even a grenade in a small closed room fails to do much more than stun one of them. It's beyond ridiculous, but would not have been so bad had they simply moved on from that room after a few exchanged shots. Instead, they stay in this room with no cover for what feels like forever, with 2-3 people searching for a file the entire time. So, you'd think that when you cut away from that fiasco of a scene that there would be better entertainment to he had... alas it's another terribly written gunfight where 2 crouch behind a wall while 2 people on a rafter shoot at them with unless ammunition non stop. And this also stretches on and on and on. When it finally does come to a conclusion, that too is poorly executed. The one somewhat entertaining scene with Oldman has a bit more imagination put into it at least, as they go about defending the house like it's Christmas in New York. But even that has you scratching your head at some of the decisions, like why was he on the roof knocking out the window, why have the other character drive him there at all if he didn't contribute anything at all to any of the scenes other than the bus through the building. Would it not have been more interesting to have him interrupting the tech of those sieging the building instead and giving his pals a more believable chance?I don't know what happened with S03, but it sure was piss poor. And that's purely from a writing/plot perspective, the actors could only do so much with that, and they did try.Here's sincerely hoping they can return to their S01 form for S04. It sure is in a right mess at the moment though. Maybe they could try adding another character that grossly chews loudly? - oh wait.",IMDB,"Season 1 and 2 were solid, 3 took a downwards slope",7.0

Maybe im getting desperate for a decent show to watch when so much garbage has been pushed out over the last 4 or 5 years.A story about a bunch of sloppy and degenerates pushed out of the corrupted CIA, hated by their peers, but somehow seem to crack some great cases.The biggest degenerate is played by Gary Oldman who's highly intelligent but disgusting! Hahaha... The twist is his friendship with a high powered woman at the top of the CIA.The one actor id like to see replaced is the 'apparent' computer genius.... the man just can't act!

"This one slipped by us being on Apple TV so when we fell into it and had two Seasons to binge we were ecstatic. Gary Oldman as the scruffy, mercurial and obnoxious disgraced Jackson Lamb, M15 spymaster, absolutely steals an already extraordinarily good show.Its fast moving, intense and and peppered with very British dry one liners mostly delivered by Oldman. The script is excellent and some of the supporting characters odd enough to be entirely plausible and all very convincingly.We get a real feel for the world of old cold war spooks rising to meeting new modern domestic threats in a murky grey underworld beneath our city streets.I see a trailer for Season 3 and I legit cannot wait. I may have to dig out the original source Slough House.",IMDB,Gary Oldman is magnificent,10.0
"I am really enjoying this so far. Spooks thrillers have been done plenty of times before and the sign of a good one is whether you want to get stuck in to the next episode straight away, which I did.

"Great stories, great characters and good pace.I haven't been able to stop watching all 3 seasons and glad to know the down and outer scan still come up trumps!

"Gary Oldman is arguably the greatest actor of his generation. He plays the lead character Jackson Lamb, a sloppy, disheveled yet brilliant Spy who heads up Slough House, the place where spy's who've somehow either screwed up or pissed the wrong person up - end up. He's snarky, foul mouthed and witty. Despite his outward appearance of being a seemingly washed up, recycled detective, he's not lost his edge and is incredibly insightful.The story line & writing is brilliant and the show moves along quickly with lots of action, twists and turns. The characters are intriguing; each with plenty of depth and stories of their own.There is good story telling here with an excellent cast.",IMDB,Gary Oldman at his finest!,10.0
"I found this series completely by accident when I got a free three month trial subscription to AppleTV+; which is generally too wokey for me. However, by the time the title credits rolled I was already hooked. The plot revolves around a bunch of misfit spies relegated to Slough House; where incompetent spies are sent to end their days ; for various cock-ups and transgressions. All the characters were well cast but for me there were a few stand out performances. Jack Lowden plays the young ambitious newcomer, River, sent there after being set up, bumbling around trying to prove he's as good a spy as his dad but continually messing it up. Saskia Reeves as the alcoholic administrator who is smarter than she appears is in excellent form whilst Christopher Chung plays the obnoxious tech guy so well I actually wanted to slap him and Freddie Fox looks like he is really enjoying playing his character like a James Bond arch villain. Then there is Gary Oldman's ageing spy, Jackson Lamb, who seeped onto our screens with a fart. His character seems like a run down, seedy, uncouth version of his portrayal of George Smiley, who leads his little group of misfits through two seasons of great spy capers where they prove that they are smarter than we are led to believe, beating MI5 to the punch every time. It was good to see British humour throughout rather than the brash humourless stuff we often have to endure. Well done to all the production team for a well written, well crafted show. I really hope there are more seasons to come.",IMDB,Simply Superb,10.0
"We really enjoyed the premise of the show, a bunch of failed agents relegated to an MI5 dump trying to rescue a kidnapped boy, while being hunted by their own. It has a dark, cringey humour that we found funny, although it went past the line to just cringey and unpleasant sometimes. Unfortunately the ending involved such boneheaded, implausible stupidity (and not in a funny way) on the part of the bad guys, the reject agents and MI5 that it really disrupted the viewing experience. There is also a disjointed subplot about one of the agent's husband that distracted from the main plot and made for a weird ending. This shouldn't put anyone off watching the show, it's original and funny, but just be forewarned not to expect a clever twist or funny reveal.",IMDB,"Great Concept, Stupid Ending",6.0

Promising first episode, in any case, with Gary Oldman as the boss from he!!, and some generic young actor as the disgraced lead finding his way back and finding validation and meaning in the cutthroat world of MI5.Episode 04 crashes and burns.

I didn't realize it was him until the 3rd episode.It's not often that you develop feelings for the characters in espionage stories, but here, despite the unlikable characteristics, they seem more human, realistic, and their vulnerabilities engender a sort of disfunctional affection for the damaged, self-absorbed, unwise slow horses.I look forward to season 3 and 4, hoping they'll eventually do a season for the (currenly) 7 books in the series.",IMDB,Splendid Spy Stuff,9.0

It is an unpredictable show; while watching I was thinking, ""a'right, it's going to be like that, that's the guy, that's the event."" But stop right there, it's not going to be like that; the story seems like a simple plot, but dive into it and you'll find it's layered.

Wow what a second season we've had. It was astounding from start to finish.The pace was fast. Faster than season 1.The slow horses grew up in season 2.I didn't want the series to finish a sit held me thoroughly.The twists and turns never stopped but unlike season 1 they didn't get bogged down in soap opera style internal politics and needless subplots.I honesty thought that Gary Oldman would never make a good actor. I remember when he started on the BBC and he wasn't up to much. He played the same stereotype time after time.And then when he got the chance he took it.In this series he's outsatinding.

"I've read all the books and the TV adaptations are spot on - of course, they can't follow the books exactly, but they are superbly excellent in their own right.Gary Oldman and the whole cast shine, each in their own special way. The underrated subtleness of the story lines displays so well just how good the Slough House book series is. There's none of the bang, crash, vroom of US TV and that's very, very good - enough of the mindless violence and senseless car chases. This has violence, but it is controlled and in the right measure. It has ironic humour in spades, and that's good too.Altogether the most watchable TV at the moment and thankfully Mick Herron has written more in the book series - and more TV adaptions to come, I hope.",IMDB,And series 3 doesn't disappoint either.,10.0
"As numerous others have said this is a great series which should win Gary Oldman plenty of awards.However, what really makes this stand out are the supporting cast and in particular the excellent performances of four female actors who steel every scene they are in:
Sophie Okonedo
Kristen Scott-Thomas
Saskia Reeves
Aimee-Ffion Edward
Okonedo and Scott-Thomas play the role of jaded department heads/operatives, that would normally be played by male actors, brilliantly.Reeves is a real surprise playing the dowdy down trodden 'mouse' whilst Fion-Edwards plays the edgy 'rebel' with her usual aplomb.",IMDB,Great female cast,10.0
"This is a series not to be missed. A group of disgraced MI5 agents are banished to Slough House - a crumbling backwater left to slowly rot both literally and metaphorically. MI5 hopes the humiliated agents will resign from the service after enduring endless days of made-up paper work. However, led by a disheveled and foul mouthed Jackson Lamb (a role inhabited to perfection by Gary Oldman) , the Slough House irregulars end up involved in dangerous but exciting situations brought about primarily by the greed and ambition of both politicians and MI5 high ranking officers (not to mention incompetence). The plots are compelling - often funny - and reveal the dark side of spy craft in contrast to the James Bond type of portrayal. The characters are memorable with their own weaknesses and limits on display but come together when one of their lot is endangered. This series is among the best ever.",IMDB,An outstanding adaptation of Mick Herrons books with a stellar cast,10.0
"Ive read all the books in the series and always felt it was going to be difficult to transfer to TV. The books have so much content. But the series has been faithful to the books and the casting has been brilliant. Despite my doubts.I do, however, recommend reading the books first.",IMDB,Read the books first.,10.0
"Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Reminiscent in some ways of the Harry Palmer films of the 60s - Ipcress File, Funeral In Berlin and Billion Dollar Brain - but better. No spy glamour like Bond or Bourne but a much more real feel.Oldman is inspired casting and on fabulous form. Clearly having a ball with the role. Hits just the right tone with his relationships both with his Slow Horses characters from The Park.Kristen Scott-Thomas is a revelation as Taverner and Jack Lowden is great as the frustrated secret agent.The writing is superb, the storylines totally engaging and the pace overall is just perfect.I haven't enjoyed a how as much as this since for a very long time.",IMDB,So far so perfect,10.0
"Had no expectations as hadn't read or seen anything about Slow Horses, but it was a pleasant surprise and a real cracker of a show. The characters are all really well done with all the actors and actresses being spot on. A little slow in places but prefect to binge watch.I've been binging both seasons and hanging out for season 3, which comes out this year in 2023. I would highly recommend this to spy buffs who love a great winding story. I won't put in any spoilers as it's too good to not know what happens. The villains are clever characters who are compelling to watch.I say again it's a must see.",IMDB,"A cracker of a show, pleasantly surprised.",9.0
"Not a native speaker, so excuse me for my English. I enjoyed first two seasons. Especially the first one. It had a pretty good plot, a somewhat dark tone, it was serious when it had to be, and sometimes - silly but likable. Season two was alright even though the last couple episodes were too campy and unbelievable even by the standards of the series.But then we've got season three... Well, the series became a parody of itself. Silly but likable it was no more. Just annoyingly stupid. All the characters from the first two seasons (Lamb, Standish, Cartright, etc.) looked like caricatures of themselves. And the new ones... Oh, boy. Especially that ""Rambo"" girl... Irritating.It's a shame that the series which started so good went downhill so fast.1st season - 7/10
2nd season - 6/10
3rd season - 3/10.",IMDB,It was really good... until it became a total crap,6.0
"I just watched all 3 seasons of Slow Horses this past weekend because everyone has been talking about it. There's only 6 episodes per season so it's easy to binge in a day or two. I have always loved Gary Oldman since the first time I saw him in The Firm. I haven't read any of the books in the Slow Horses series by Mick Herron so I don't know how the show compares.I really enjoyed all three seasons equally which is surprising because usually the quality starts to drop after the first one. I guess that's a testament to the books because I believe each season is based off of the first three books in the series. My only complaint is the character Roddy, I love sarcasm and arrogance but it has to be justified. He just comes off as a creepy incel who calls women degrading names because they refuse to date him. He has absolutely no redeeming qualities and he's shown no growth as a character whatsoever.I get what they're going for with Jackson Lamb but his whole gross shtick is beginning to be a bit over the top. We get it. He doesn't bathe regularly and he likes to fart in front of everyone and anyone. By the end of season three it's like beating a dead horse (see what I did there) and it's become overkill.",IMDB,Really Good !,9.0
"Will persevere with the 2nd series but the first was largely daft: a fancifully contrived main plot completely devoid of any credibility - its unbelievability just made it ridiculous rather than shocking; needless vulgarity in Gary Oldman's character that adds neither humour nor value; unbelievable sexual attraction between Guy and Harper - just no chemistry exists between them and she just randomly accuses him of thinking about sex with no credible reason; some really pedestrian ""action"" scenes that are laughable rather than exciting, etc. Great potential but so far undelivered due to superficial characters and plot. Classified as a thriller, but few thrills so far.",IMDB,Daft 1st series,6.0
"It's a completely ridiculous concept: MI5, the top British spy agency, has a group of misfit agents who work in a decrepit office above a store. One of the misfits is there for making a mistake on a training exercise which occurred in a real airport where he knocked over about 25 civilians to catch a make believe terrorist. I lasted one episode.",IMDB,Yet another overrated show,3.0
"The best series for many a year. Just brilliant acting and script that is just like watching the books. I am so envious of the people who haven't read Mick Heron's books and are seeing the stories for the first time. I also love Mick Jagger's theme music and cannot wait for the next series' (please Tim Cook) let alone next week's episode even though I know what will happen.It is so refreshing to watch shows where there are no green screens, action shootouts and car chases and that many minorities and ethnicities are included non-gratuitously and realistically, for the U.

"I've read all the books and watched both tv series. The books are very good and the series...even better.The books are beautifully written and the series is perfectly cast, especially Gary Oldman as Jackson Lamb and Jack Lowden as River Cartwright. Also, Kirsten Scott Thomas, Saskia Reeves and Freddie Fox.I loved the first series and the second one is even better. The strengths and weaknesses of the flawed characters are revealed gradually. The knots and twists of the plot uncover Cold War rivalries, unfinished business, surprising twists, and relevance to current political corruption, although the books were written over ten years ago.It's gritty, bleak and often seems to smell bad but there's dark comedy weaving through it too.",IMDB,Excellent!,10.0
Definitely worth watching. I've never read the books so I don't know if the adaptation is great but regardless this is well acted and interesting enough to watch. Gary Oldmans performance is as usual excellent.,IMDB,Worth watching,8.0
I think every GO movie I have watched over the years I have hated. I hated his acting and never understood why they keep casting him in anything but a beer commercial. Well in this movie I stand corrected.Gary Oldman is stellar in this and the character suits him 100% While the series itself is not earth shattering I enjoyed every second G. O. was on screen. I look forward to more of this from him!,IMDB,Watch it if only to see Gary Oldman,8.0
Loved this series ... stays true to the book and Gary Oldman in all his disgusting glory is definitely the one who makes the show. The characters really come into their own throughout the series and I can't wait for another season of this. Well done Will Smith for the amazing writing too. Just see it and ignore the naysayers.,IMDB,A really nice Brit spy series after a long time,8.0
"Despite some hilarious misunderstandings by quite a number of reviewers, this is set in England and any apparently obvious tropes should be treated with caution. Anything less 'woke' than Gary Oldman's Jackson Lamb is hard to imagine.Fantastic casting and the best thing I've seen in a very long time.",IMDB,Brilliant,10.0
"Season 1 was amazing. It had these very small plot twists thrown in at just the right times which would change the whole perspective and angle through which you were looking at the story. Very john-le-carré-esque, I was hooked by the end of the intro in episode 1 (season 1). Season 2 on the other hand loses all the freshness and originality, settling down for something entirely linear, straightforward, not a single twist, quite boring, all leading to a rather dismal conclusion and a joke of a 'final confrontation'. Standish's check game was by far the most exciting thing that happened. A Shame. I don't have very high expectations for the following season, not sure it'll be worth watching.",IMDB,"Amazing start, then, engine dies quickly",6.0
"I liked season one quite a bit, it was impressive. But I must admit, I simply cannot remember it was THIS good.The first two episodes already suggest an intricate plot; an interesting blend of British back-stabbing office politics and fair dose of Cold War nostalgia. The onset promises to have us clinging to the edge of our seats for the remaining season. The witty dialogue is perfectly paced, and Gary Oldman's performance is out of this world. This is right up there, in the Breaking Bad-osphere.I sometimes forget, but Slow Horses - season 2 reminds me, that really strong TV screenwriting, is an art-form in its own right.",IMDB,Season two - off to a flying start,9.0
"""Slow Horses"" (S01, 6-eps, 40-50+ mins, Apple) is a British counter-terrorism drama with a tinge of comedic elements that derive from MI-5's Slough House, a dumping ground for washed out counter-spies affectionately, er derisively, referred to as slow horses. The nut of the plot is an Indian student in London needs to be rescued from domestic terrorists before he's beheaded, and the ""slow horses"" that should be sidelined with time-wasting paperwork endeavor to contribute to the rescue. The pacing is slow, production values are low budget, and you have to be inside British culture to get alot of the references. Gary Oldman stars as Jackson Lamb, a horrible burned out curmudgeon who insults and denigrates almost anyone in his orbit. He's like ""Dr House"" without a filter. This turned me off initially but I grew numb to it later. It's a decent watch, and the case is resolved, so if there's a sophomore season, it'd feature a different storyline. I would be more enthusiastic if it had a more attractive cast and tripled its budget.",IMDB,Slow Horses are MI-5 washouts and this series might join 'em,6.0
"I have enjoyed many great Apple TV offerings. This is not one of them. The story is bland, the characters aren't the least bit interesting, and it couldn't be more derivative and cliche if it tried.But the worst part of it is the constant threats between Oldman and Thomas of destroying the other's career. All the clandestine operations seem to be one branch of MI5 trying to destroy another branch of MI5.This is a very negative, pessimistic show with no redeeming qualities and no one to cheer for except the false flag kidnapping victim.",IMDB,Bridge to Nowhere,3.0

"Fantastic spy series, gritty, real. First two episodes might be a bit slow for some, and Gary Oldman's character is unlikable (endearingly so at the end) but it's a fantastic yarn, gripping drama and thoroughly enjoyable tv - easily the best thing we've seen on appleTV.While there is a little gore, it always felt necessary for the story, and certainly never felt gratuitous. One of the aspects I enjoyed the most was its unpredictability - I can guess the outcome and secrets of almost every show I watch these days, but there were some genuinely unpredictable turns throughout the series.Can't wait for S2 !",IMDB,Slow start but absolutely worth it,10.0
"Gary Oldman in a spy thriller. Brilliant! I loved this. Didn't watch it when it was released. I always wait until I can binge watch. Finally got round to watching it and did so in 1 evening. 6 episodes perfect. Acting, suspense, tension all in abundance. Can't praise it enough. After watching final episode, got a teaser for season two. I don't think I can let all episodes build up before binge watching again. I'd have to watch an episode a week...maybe.

"The premise is interesting , the storyline is interesting, the characters and technicalities less so. Oldman plays this unlikely dirty looking unkempt character whose department does , I am not sure what apart from he shouts and throws files in the bin. He is a cross between Jack Regan and the leader of the dirty dozen. His offices despite being part of MI5 seem to have no security or cameras or surveillance, just a key. Seen better security at a petrol station. The head of the MI5 section is of course some stony faced woman, yawn what a surprise. She seems incompetent, but it's hard to tell as she just looks miserable and pretends to be important by answering a phone and rushing out of meetings. Her complete disaster of the operation in series one would have her in slow horses faster than anyone. The main character is the most able and likeable how he puts up with the others around him is a mystery.Anyhow I have invested enough time in it to keep watching.",IMDB,Good enough to keep me watching,7.0
"Well, apart from very strange so called 'Russian' surnames Season 2 is worth a shot. Pardon the pun.Pity Russians are too those Russians-like gangsters Hollywood has in mind when it comes to ex-Soviet era spies and such. Nevertheless it was fun to watch. Oldman is a cornerstone of the season, although some of the others are not bad, as well.And yeah, I'm Russian, so forgive me for not so perfect English.I've been wondering, by the way, why on Earth did producers not use the consultants on Russian names? I'm aware that most of the viewers are not giving a flying f.ck, but hey, it's a global world and just imagine how next to nothing it would be to check.",IMDB,Season 2 is better,8.0
"Take one high school age, politically correct, no experience of the world writer who reads very narrowly, let them write an MI5 script and this is the sort of formulaic, flat, rip off, predictable, unashamedly political yawner you'd end up with. Not to say the writer actually is at high school, but it feels like it.Really, why does the world need yet another show that puts so much effort into trying to force a tired, narrow, self serving agenda on viewers that there is no effort left to be any good at all, when an MI5 show could be written to explore real nuances, conflicting views, get into what is driving society as it is today and simply being honest? It can be done. It has been done before. Just not here. Not even remotely.As for the directing, production, performances, Oldman has a little depth yet is 100% formulaic. The rest are forgetablly poor but Jack. Lowden deserves special mention for impersonating Simon Pegg much of the time. Why? For what reason? Maybe he does this normally and it is simply news to me because I've not seen much of his work. But whatever the case, why? If you are going to impersonate an actor, why Pegg?I was going to give up part way through episode 1 but based on certain reviews here decided to stick with it to see for myself up to episode 3.",IMDB,"Formulaic, flat, rip off, predictable, unashamedly political yawner",7.0

"The first two episodes were engaging enough, although I could see woke politics was going to turn into the theme of this show instead of just entertaining the audience, which is a bore in and of itself. Nonetheless, I kept going with it but about half way through episode 3, the story line begins to fall apart. Slogged through the 4th episode but by the end of episode 5, I had had enough. The acting is excellent but the writing put those great actors into an impossible situation, that is, trying to turn a bad script into something worth saving. Predictable, stereotypical, uncreative, uninspiring. That is, a complete bore.I really wanted to like this show because not much worth watching is being produced these days that either isn't completely inane or making attempts to indoctrinate viewers. I suspect those who gave it anything above a 7 rating didn't watch enough of the show to give it a valid rating.",IMDB,From pretty good to really bad in short order.,8.0

"""Smiley was always coming back from redundancy"" - so says Gary Oldman, who played George Smiley in the excellent 2011 film adaptation of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. But there are few redundant elements to be found in Slow Horses: the narrative and character development, based on Mick Herron's novels, are well-crafted and well-paced, action scenes are appropriately tense and not too flashy, and the acting is, for the most part (barring Christopher Chung), cracking. A good mix of comedy, drama, and tense capering makes for an enjoyable series - more please!The star of the show is Gary Oldman, making his tv series debut, as grizzled and flatulent Lamb. He's funny and troubled in equal measure, playing the anti-hero very well. Kristin Scott Thomas is perfectly cast as the cold and calculated as leader of MI5's Regent's Park headquarters--her scenes with Lamb are electric.Special mention to the amusing musical moments here and there, which add some necessary light to the dark and dingy machinations of the secret service operatives.Brian Vernel is absolutely terrifying as one of the villains, embodying an angry young man with nothing to lose whose mind has been melted by anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric.

"From a fast-paced opening, with our apparent young hero racing to stop a bombing, we drop to an absolutely torpid pace after he fails fairly messily. It fits because he's been sent off to gather moss with other service failures, burnouts, and misfits. These are not the competent men and women saving Britain, make no mistake. The Slow Horses are Losers. Slough House is the warehouse where they perform drudgework designed to encourage them to quit, and keep them out of trouble until then. Their minder is a grotesque: bloated, flatulent, smoking, drinking, holey-socked, abusive, offensive.We will not see any wins from this team that are not Pyrrhic, not despite themselves. They won't be quick-witted, but there is humor.The ostensible baddies are nationalists, but pay attention: they're being manipulated by other forces.

"In the spectrum of spy movies, you have at one end more 'realistic' ones like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (written by an ex-spy), high on intrigue and low on action. On the other end, you have the wildly unrealistic action-packed stuff like James Bond (incidentally also written by an ex-spy).Slow Horses (not written by an ex-spy) is right in the middle of that spectrum, it wants to have its cake and eat it too. I am sure there is an audience who love this middlebrow melange of Le Carre and Fleming, but I am not that audience.The story pretends to some type of realism by rattling off some spy jargon, yet it has spies and agencies behaving cartoonishly way too often. Then there are the cliched stock characters like the 'all-powerful hacker' and the 'unhinged fanatic'. The development of Gary Oldman's character doesn't make much sense.On the plus side, the acting is almost uniformly good and elevates the material. Oldman, Kristin Scott Thomas, Saskia Reeves and Brian Vernel stand out. There are some clever twists and the thrill is maintained throughout. I would have much preferred if it dropped the pretence of being something more and settled for being what it was -- a vanilla thriller.",IMDB,Halfway between Tinker Tailor and James Bond,10.0
"I've worked with blokes exactly like Jackson Lamb. He is the perfect representation of some in real life, vile, arrogant, unthinking and unhygenic, but are actually exceedingly proficient in their work. Yes the series stretches the bounds of realism, you cannot compress years of intelligence work into a series without having to dramatise events, most people would be bored to tears if they had to watch what really happens.Slow Horses was exciting, interesting, well acted by all and above all else, was pure escapism. Gary Oldman was sublime.The story lines were crafted, knitted together carefully and were not overly complicated or full of jargon that would put some off after ten minutes.I did not lose interest for one second whilst watching it, and i look forward to series 3 and 4.",IMDB,Lamb is an original.,6.0
"This series is worth watching because of Gary Oldman as Jackson Lamb, but it is marred fatally by reliance on what I call the British Plot. That's the plot in which the culprit turns out to be some institutional chief, in this case, the First and Second Desks of MI-5. That might have been startling forty years ago, but it has become standard and in fact the ONLY plot in the BBC. It gets old.Worse. Although the reality is that intelligence agencies are plagued by too much loyalty to agents, in this case the head of MI-5 cheerfully orders the murder of agents and others, as if this wasn't a world in whcih a single phone call, or phone video, can bring a career to an end - can put you in prison. Come on. The reality is that high ranking bureaucrats are far more worried about Congressional and Parliamentary inquiries than they are about bureaucratic rivals. The notion that they would blithely take a chance on prison for the sake of a career advantage is simply absurd. It's not that I naively believe in good faith. It's that the risk-reward ratio in this fishbowl world isn't worth it, and ranking officers in the CIA and MI-5 know that well. Some actual reality would be welcome.",IMDB,Marred by The British Plot,9.0
"The first appearance of the series put me off a bit, as it looked too much like a trendy with yellow-green filter retro look.But it was a good decision to get involved with the series. Because it starts surprisingly fast exciting for an Apple series, you can't take your eyes off it and want to know what happens next.The agent series also introduces ""non"" agent fans to the genre very well in the first season, as it's not immediately about ""spy-versus-spy"". It's a civilian who is kidnapped and the suspense of whether he survives or not keeps you riveted until the last episode.Jackson Lamb, is the down-and-out, shady and incredibly belligerent head of a squad of failed MI5 spy agents who were written off by MI5 because, for one reason or another, they botched their mission and now indulge in their dreary existence bored at the Slow House. Until River Cartwright is banished to the Slow House. With his zest for action he brings new wind into the troop. In the course of time you get to know the different characters, each of them convinces with quirkiness and charm. Kristin Scott Thomas' duplicitous duet in this series with Gary Oldman adds greatly to the entertainment.The humor is very British, very wicked, and it is through this that the character of Jackson Lamp is burned deeper and deeper into your heart. He dresses like someone who doesn't care about his looks and seems to live on cigarettes and hard liquor. Yet he hides a razor sharp mind and can still make it seem like a lucky guessThe series spins a complex web with surprising and dramatic outcomes for all the characters and a mix of delicious black humor. The trio of directors James Hawes, Jeremy Lovering and Saul Metzstein, along with Will Smith and his team of four screenwriters, have seamlessly and beautifully adapted Mick Herron's 2010 novel.We were captivated by the series, even though I'm not the biggest fan of the retro look with a yellow and green filter. But the story and the talented cast have convinced us, so that we have watched them one after the other. We are happy that the series has already been extended for two more seasons and are looking forward to the new cases for the Slow Horses.------Conclusion:A suspenseful spy thriller worth watching, which can convince with a good story, detailed character drawing and wicked humor. It was an absolute pleasure to watch this series.or a hunch. He's a much more complex character than he seems, which makes him quite fascinating. Gary Oldman is great in his role, he's surly, obnoxious, unkempt, doesn't have a good word for his charges towards them and yet he keeps his bunch together, or at least he tries to, because it's easier to herd a bag of fleas than his posse.

"I know it's billed as a drama/thriller series bit it's also downright hilarious in parts. After seeing Oldman and Scott-Thomas as husband and wife Winston and Clementine Churchill in the totally serious ""Darkest Hours"" it's hard to stifle a laugh when they're on screen together in this series. Scott-Thomas deserves a BAFTA award just for keeping a straight face during some of their scenes together as Oldman treats her as crudely as possibly in every encounter. All the supporting characters are perfectly chosen, not just for their acting ability but their actual facial characteristics and mannerisms. They genuinely inhabit their roles. Near the end when the ""Slow Horses"" all meet at Blake's grave and are ready to split up, perhaps never to see one another again, Oldman appears ready to deliver a sentimental farewell but instead tells them all what a useless and incompetent bunch they are and what a low point in his career it has been to be associated with them.

"If at first you find yourself watching a brilliant lead actor with excellent support cast entertaining you then sure enough you are as I was. Then I found myself laughing at the mundane acerbic wit but then that too is intentional. Then it dawns on you that the mysterious glamorous world of espionage is indeed rather dull and consists of normal people doing occasionally extraordinary things. After that you then spot that despite laugh out loud moments it isn't a comedy at all but rather it is a superbly well written brilliantly acted and far more realistic view of the secret services. If you want James Bond you are in the wrong place, if you want something closer to reality then you have found a glorious slow burner.",IMDB,Spying... 99% dull... but that 1%...,10.0

"Overall it is a well scripted spy drama, characters well written, acting is very good, good casting as well, worth a watch. However, the pace slows down a bit too much at times. I felt there were occasions when the writing was over the top or lazy. Lamb is such a dick to everyone in the team. This part was overdone to the point of not being plausible. The bunch of misfits are supposedly in the 'Slough House' due to slipping up in their career at some point, but the makers want us to think they are actually good secret service agents/spies. However, at one point I felt River deserved to be in the Slough House, when he left an axe within arm's reach of the wounded kidnapper/assassin/murderer. I am sure MI5 will agree this is covered in their basic training. Such inconsistencies are the deal breaker between a good show and a great one.",IMDB,"Kept me hooked, but....",7.0

"So I was elated to see Apple+ pick up this series. I read *all* the Herron books and novellas before this was even announced, and this series is very true to the novels. Gary Oldman was inspired casting for the Jackson Lamb character, and I have no issues with any of the other castings, they are all excellent actors and represent their characters well.This is, by the way, a straight British spy series, there are no hidden aliens or monsters or vampires or anything similar. Think of an updated John le Carré, set 50 or so years later in time to the present day. If that's your jam, you will likely love this series.The first 2 seasons that A+ put out were pretty true to the books, which is IMHO a very good thing. The season 3 trailer looks great. Hope Apple manages to do all 8 novels, that would be awesome!And, if you have not read the books (yet) the first episode or two can seem a bit slow, but there's a *huge* backtory that only develops over time, so give it a couple of eps to get started.(P. S. the books are even better than the series, again IMHO.)",IMDB,I've been a Mick Herron fan for years,10.0
"In Season 2, Episode 4 of the Apple TV+ series ""Slow Horses,"" titled ""Cicada,"" tensions escalate as secrets unravel and alliances shift. Let's delve into the key moments that left some viewers disappointed.The Death of Min Harper: The episode opens with Rebecca revealing the truth about Min's death to Jackson Lamb (played by Gary Oldman). Min's demise was orchestrated by Russian operatives Piotr and Kyril, with Arkady Pashkin (whom Louisa tries to seduce for information) and Andrei Chernitsky playing crucial roles. The scene is intense, but some viewers felt it lacked the suspense they expected from seasoned intelligence officers.Missed Opportunities for Caution: John (presumably Jackson Lamb) failing to be cautious about his surroundings-allowing Alex to surprise him-struck a discordant note. For an experienced intelligence officer, overlooking basic security protocols seemed implausible. Viewers anticipated more vigilance from the characters, especially in high-stakes situations.Impact on Viewer Experience: This oversight had a ripple effect on the series. Some viewers found it hard to reconcile the characters' lapses with their professional backgrounds. The simplicity of the oversight detracted from the otherwise intricate plot, leaving a sense of missed potential. While ""Slow Horses"" excels in character development and suspense, this particular scene left a few disappointed.In summary, ""Slow Horses"" Season 2, Episode 4 had its share of surprises, but the lapse in situational awareness raised eyebrows among viewers. As the Cicadas' web of intrigue tightens, let's hope subsequent episodes maintain the tension without sacrificing realism.",IMDB,Season 2 episode 4 lowered my expectations,6.0
"I never read the novels, so I had zero expectations while watchingSlow Horses started off well. I was impressed particularly by Gary Oldman performance, concluding Season 1 with decent level of interestJumping to the second season, writing started to become more amateurish, over doing topics like Lamb's lack of hygiene, and adding too many nonsensical characters choices. Acting started to drop by introducing Kadiff Kirwan (as Markus)Now, at the time of writing three episodes from season three have passed, and I can't even tolerate pushing myself to the end of season! It's becoming too ridiculous to tolerate! Even Rosalind Eleazer (as Luisa) is terribly overacting her grumpy role, stupid coincidences like discovering getting lead to kidnapped Standish from a common hair clip on randomly dropped under a bridge, plus a lot of stupid dialogues between Shirly and Markus that sound like a grade 3 school skit!I don't think I'll keep watching it.",IMDB,Sad it came down to this (Season 1 through 3 drop),4.0

I was a big fan of Spooks in the 90s / 2000 and this has a more edgy and big budget feel to it, one of the best Apple TV + programmes. It is worth investing into the show knowing that it has been renewed for several seasons so good to know you can watch and know you will be able to see the continued journey of the characters.

Very satisfying.So if I need to add more characters for my review, I just have to say that Oldman is one of the coolest actors in the world. This series really suits him well. The sarcasm and wittiness in his speech is beyond anything else I´ve seen, and still carried out with a sort of empathy and care for his subordinates. You just have to watch it yourself.

"It feels like I'm secretly spying on Slough House in the rain, The musty smell of rain, the squeaking of footsteps, and the sound of farting... People usually say that a work has a sense of vitality, but this is the first time I've ever seen a work that smells on the screen.Thanks to such a wonderful director, director, screenwriter, and actors. I really like the strong emotions that are alive in the unique feeling of being slow and sinking and dying. Although the Slough House was killed long ago, the Slow Horses are still alive in the midst of it.As we progress through the first season, the actors' facial expressions continue to tell us that there are more hidden things in this story.It's clear that Diana and Jackson Lamb have a more complex and nuanced relationship than they seem. And I'm looking forward to the endless relationship development that other characters will gradually achieve in the future. Slow horses and Regents Park are both crazy. You're fu*king useful!It's a British sensibility, but people who have seen Slow Horses in Korea say it's the best, including me.We are not critics, but it was good that all the clues were collected in the eyes of the general public. The detailed and attractive story that could not be cut in the middle was delivered neatly.I first saw it because of Gary Oldman, but I fell in love with the work itself.

"Season 2 just finished and I must say something clicked with me this time around that just wasn't there for the first season. Maybe it was the show, maybe it was me, but this season really felt like things went up a notch. The acting was great as expected, but the character dynamics felt a bit more grounded and real, perhaps simply because we knew of a bit of their backgrounds already. If you're looking for a good crime drama involving secret agents, Slow Horses should definitely be up on the list, is quite good. Following the titular Slow Horses, MI5's dumping ground for failed or disappointing operatives. Mainly checked this out due to Gary Oldman who stars as the leader of said group, his acting is of course superb and the rest of the cast holds up.

"The TV show is cursed by a need to use violence to deliver excitement and drama.Slow Horses has characters which are unmet in entertainment delivery opportunity since Barney Miller. The characters are special. Or they were.Slow Horses is like.... Barney Miller on steroids without enough ammunition to deliver a high enough body count to score better viewer ratings.It's too bad. Slow Horses has certainly inspired me to ""not"" read the book. I have to assume the book is violence oriented.Oh well. The whole sorting garbage start added enough of an element of momentary realism to trap me. Then I had to wonder if I was watching Band of Brothers or a really warped version of Get Smart.It's too bad Slow Horses devolves from a higher plane of writing into shoot outs. Have we lost our ability as an audience to process drama in the details?There is just too much violence in entertainment now. Slow Horses best saving grace is it's characters. The characters details are too often over shadowed by the violence. That's a loss. But the show still has it's characters. It's just hard to keep attention focused upon to the details that inspire us to feel attached to these.... people. Thanks to the acting and the subtle character development; the show is still entertaining even with the over use of violence.I'll watch the show up until it ends or it becomes unwatchable.Someone will write, then produce, a better version of this television show and it will be much more fun without too much violence.",IMDB,Too much violence ruined a great start.,6.0

The bad-guy thugs were last century over-used stereotypes but updating to modern far-left fascists would maybe have taken some of the fun out of this enjoyable spy thriller.

"Gary Oldman can do no wrongs. And undoubtedly, Jackson Lamb carry the day. But if you squint and make the effort to look beyond his performance (flawlessly acted, excellently scripted and accurately costumed; adorably horrible and repulsively charismatic throughout), there's actually a pretty solid noir thriller in the background.The premise: bargain-bin operatives whom MI5 cannot fire, are exiled in a special division in charge of rescuing cats and and pushing paper. This gives a refreshingly lo-fi, lo-glam twist to the espionage genre (which, tbh, since the fall of the wall, struggles a bit to rise to its former heights). Said team is well thought out, quirky without being flamboyant and flawed without being hopeless. Special mention go to Christopher Chung and especially Saskia Reeves who both pull memorable performances.The scenarios of both season are intricate and full of twists, although I don't feel they measure up to the cast of characters: the loyalists of the first are not nearly gritty enough and there's a bit of demonstrative 'good people on all sides' going on (never a good look when you sell your story as Le Carré realism). The second season is less complex and has some plot holes (either that or Taverner is spectacularly incompetent), but it does 'rural England' well, which is rare enough to deserve mention.The problem (perhaps inevitable as seasons pile up) is that the delectably clueless characters edge ever closer to becoming competent. I understand the need for character growth, but we at risk of loosing track of the premise... to end up with mere Jason Bourne lookalikes, which would be a real shame.",IMDB,Gritty spy thriller with an outstanding cast,8.0
"I enjoyed series 1 and am in the middle of series 2. Very exciting opening sequence in episode one (series 1) and then it slows down. Overall very good. Main character Lamb tries a little to hard to be a lecherous ass who is unpleasant to everyone. Almost off-putting, as it becomes a little silly. Sometimes funny though. Thankfully he tones it down a bit as the show progresses and his couldn't-give-a-damn attitude works well. In series 2, episode 3, the younger main character (I forget his name) is offered a gin and tonic. His host realises there is no tonic in the fridge and (oddly) asks him to get some from the shed at the end of the garden. He returns with a whole crate of it (why so much?) and as he looks up the garden he can see the table outside being prepared. Guess what is on already on the table? The crate of tonic he has not yet brought up the garden! Serious continuity error.",IMDB,Enjoyable series,8.0
"Great characters and story... intrigue and cliffhangers...what else?Right from 1st episode I was very intrigued by the character development and also the great acting on the part of each of the cast. You really do have the feeling that somebody has painstakingly crafted this together - clever plot twists, a deer cameo and nifty chase scenes all make for an enjoyable night in... I am looking forward to sinking my teeth into season 2... think Gary Oldman is loving this role... I really do hope that they don't just cancel the show for no real apparent reason it would be really great to see where they decide to take it.",IMDB,Solid Brit Thriller - witty and very watchable,9.0
"Deliciously fast-paced with incredibly strong performances, great writing, and loads of twists and turns. Gary Oldman is a standout as a canny, older spymaster who is a personal mess, an interpersonal disaster, and ruthless in doing what he needs to do. He makes an art of taking advantage of those who think him past his prime. Kristen Scott-Thomas doesn't quite rise to the same level in terms of pure personality projection, but still delivers one of her better performances.Loads of plots, subplots, betrayals, sleeper agents, deceptions
and diversions. There are lots of cliches, but they play fresh somehow. Salted with cynical politics and a grey moral view of realpolitik.Very enjoyable.",IMDB,Terrific Spy vs Spy,8.0
"Slow Horses delivers a promising starting but can't hold the level. After the second episode it becomes a boring and well known agent / secret service series. It adds nothing new, nothing unseen, nothing untold. If you have watched any secret service series, than you can expect the same setting and story here. MI5 causes many damages but always wins. This is something we see in Hollywood productions with the heroic FBI, CIA etc. Which always saves the world. You can expect the same story here. Although I really like Gary Oldman, but Jackson Lamb is such an annoying character, it was a torture watching him. I really couldn't care lass what's behind his story. Lamb is an awful character and I whisked the second season would be without him. Unfortunately, he is the main character. Nevertheless, the reason why I still give 7 stars is because despite all the negative aspects I've written, Slow Horses was entertaining and fun to watch AND had a not-bad-ending. If the season finale would end like Suspicion for example, I would definitely give 1 star.",IMDB,Like other typical Secret Service series but still entertaining,7.0

Add that to a lead who is so Action-Hero-Simon-Pegg that it's distracting (sorry mate, I know it's not your fault) and it doesn't come to much. Could do better, and it's a shame. Probably loved by Line of Duty fans I expect.",IMDB,Two dimensional,5.0
"What is it with characters who are a complete disaster on the outside but who's mind is meticulous and brilliant? Oldman plays it perfectly because even after the first season we still don't have a complete picture of Lamb. We get these slivers of his ability while he watches his team trip over their own shoelaces and a quick insult for their failure. Pryce plays Rivers Grandfather and and doesn't disappoint. While he only appears briefly to untangle Rivers hypotheses over a nightcap you know there is far more going on with him than just a pensioner. Unfortunately there hasn't been enough character development to really become invested, something I hope season 2 sorts out.",IMDB,Fantastic cast and a interesting thriller,8.0

"Title: ""Slow Horses"" on Apple TV+: A Refreshing Take on Espionage DramaApple TV+'s ""Slow Horses"" is a distinctive entry into the espionage genre, carving its niche by focusing on the untold stories of those often overlooked in the realm of spy dramas. The series delves into the day-to-day reality of MI5's sidelined agents, offering a refreshing perspective in an often predictable genre.The concept of the series stands as its biggest strength. The idea of exploring the world of 'failed' spies is innovative and uncharted, bringing a sense of realism to a genre typically dominated by slick operations and high-speed chases. ""Slow Horses"" draws viewers into a world where glamour gives way to reality and heroes are replaced by humans, each with their flaws and failures.The series boasts a phenomenal cast with actors of the highest calibre. Gary Oldman, known for his chameleonic acting skills, does a commendable job in the lead role of Jackson Lamb. His gruff exterior hides a complex character, skilfully presented by Oldman's nuanced performance. The supporting actors too, imbue their roles with relatability and depth, showcasing their talent with authenticity.Visually, ""Slow Horses"" doesn't disappoint. It offers an unvarnished depiction of London, far removed from the polished aesthetics of typical spy thrillers. The dreary yet authentic visuals reflect the lives of the show's characters, enhancing the series' grounding in reality.The series also takes a bold approach in its pacing, slowing down the narrative to focus more on character development than on high-octane action. This slower pace sets ""Slow Horses"" apart, allowing the show to breathe and unfold naturally.Balancing dark humor with dramatic moments, the series showcases the diversity of its narrative. It's this playfulness coupled with moments of intensity that adds another layer to the storytelling, ensuring the show remains engaging.In conclusion, ""Slow Horses"" is a commendable addition to Apple TV+'s roster. Its unique approach to the espionage genre, a stellar ensemble cast, and a compelling narrative offer viewers a refreshing and engaging watch. Through its dedication to showcasing the underdogs of the espionage world, ""Slow Horses"" breathes new life into the spy thriller genre.",IMDB,A.slow-fast and delighftul take on the spy drama,9.0
"I rarely write reviews, as it is but an opinion. But I genuinely feel this show is MASSIVELY underrated.For one, there are just not enough decent Spy shows on TV. This (I believe) shows the mundanity of spy work, the politics and the sacrifice needed.It is a great show with fantastic leads, (Gary Oldman c'mon) with a well thought out plot and intrigue woven throughout.I thoroughly enjoyed this show and have been inspired to buy the books on Kindle.I highly recommend this series to anyone with a passing interest in great acting, great drama, and great writing.",IMDB,10 is Worth it!,10.0
"This is one of my all-time favourite TV series. I loved the writing. All actors are fabulous, but Gary Oldman is the main draw. He is scathing on his cursed team. Even when his mouth is shut, he lets out agony. The 'failed in career and life, now in a miserable setup' theme reminds me of the protagonists in Goliath and Jack Irish, though 'Slow Horses' is faster. Some people have reviewed this as slow. I didn't think so. Gary Oldman's douche bag nature is predictable, but he is a loveable douche bag.Personally, I liked the locations too, especially England village roads and areas. There aren't many of them or spectacular to look at, but the city and outskirts mix is good.",IMDB,Glowing Horses,10.0

"First of all:
Season 1 is MILES ahead of 2 and 3 in every way.I don't know what happened to this promising series, maybe the writer died and they've let the runner's little sister write it... Season 3 has absolutely TERRIBLE screen writing, direction has dropped significantly and dialogue is predictable and is now so very bad as if the series turned into a parody of itself... Shocking. One could almost suspect Americans took over this project after season 2, then pulled it down to their level. Comical action scenes and overacting cast, completely idiotic shootouts, as you wonder if a superhero might suddenly turn up to save the day.What a shame.Of course Gary Oldman is fantastic, as in anything he touches, and made one totally buy into the first 2 seasons, despite the low-budget look and production (even though season 2 looks horrific lightwise, like something from Polish television in the 90's)

We felt it was predictable and frankly not very smart.Gary Oldman plays an interesting character.

I now find the show almost good enough to sit down and watch; what I actually do is play it in the background while doing things around the house.It's good enough to look forward to a new season.",IMDB,Good acting - simple & predictable story,8.0
"I thoroughly enjoyed this. Jackson Lamb is a great original character. It is tightly scripted, superbly acted, and really well paced. It's funny, there's plenty of action, and the portrayal of the internecine warfare within the services is beautifully shown.I haven't seen a better spy drama since Tinker Tailor - the original BBC series, which was the best adaptation made for TV in any genre, in my opinion. The cast are uniformly superb, and it deserves to be seen more widely - I hope it is recognised when award season comes around. I think it's the best performance I've seen from Gary Oldman. And that's saying something....",IMDB,Best since Tinker Tailor,10.0
"Slow Horses is used to describe a division of MI5 where they send those agents who have screwed up on some way. Slow is on itself a derivation of Slough as they call it Slough House because it may as well be in Slough for all the concern that the rest of MI5 gives it.Having worked in Slough, I definitely get that analogy.Gary Oldman may just be the greatest actor of his generation and he raises the entire thing from mediocrity to entertaining.If you're anal about plot holes and continuity errors like I can be, you may find some parts irritating, but it's worth watching just for Oldman and quite a lot of fun.This review was done after episode 4 because annoyingly Apple TV have decided to drip feed it in the oldschool way.",IMDB,Worth watching just for Gary Oldman,8.0
"Great story, cast, great sets, costumes etc. All really good. The only problem is the script. It has too many of the usual lazy cliques, (strong female characters, weak male characters, very ethnic cast...) which is a shame as there's s lot to like. It feels like a fresh take on things (US adaptation?) but maybe that's where the cliques come from. This could have been great, but it isn't, it's just good.",IMDB,Pretty good,8.0
"This seems to want to give Succession a run for its money. If you strip down the plot line it's pretty thin with poor character decision making. If you like snappy dialogue over real drama then this is for you. I also can't make out why Olivia Cooke (never heard of her) has such high billing. Who is she and is her character remarkable ? An unresounding NO. It was particularly irksome to hear the Mick Jagger sound track. I think it's time these old timers (and then some) make way for new talent. This screams of an insider club that Apple wanted to waste its money on. Apple, hire talent, not name brands and do real development work next time (à la HBO).",IMDB,"Prioritizes character quirks over plot, real drama",3.0

"Looking forward to this series I found it mainly lived up to expectations. This a genre that I like most of all - having read most of Le Carre, Cruz Smith and Deighton - when it is believable, rather than the Ian Fleming type rubbish.However, it sadly has it's failings. And these are in the action sequences: some of them are not believable at all. How someone dashing through a forest, in fear of his life, can be caught so easily by a severely wounded pursuer is just silly, and how often do we see that?! The director needs to get a grip on reality here.The cast is great. You can't go wrong with Gary Oldman - in anything. And Kristin Scott Thomas is perfect as the elegant, but hard as nails MI5 chief. The supporting actors are good too, and there is genuine chemistry between them.When it's all about the dialogue, locations and general storyline this looks like a promising start to (hopefully) the following seven more series. But please - polish up the action. The makers need to take a look at Ozark or Better Call Saul and see how it's done.",IMDB,Should have been a 9.,8.0
"Updated review during Season 3: I won't change my rating but wanted to update to say how frustrated I am with Season 3. The trope of 'we are a band of misfits who must save ourselves from our own people' is boring, overused, and terribly uninteresting. The first two seasons were slick and full of twists, turns, and interesting characters. This season is just shooting and yelling. Boring.When I heard the first line of the opening song...the title of my review...I knew that I was in for a wild and exhilarating ride. And I was not disappointed. This show takes all the squeaky-clean of MI-5 (Spooks in the UK) and James Bond and turns it upside down.The group of 'slow horses', led by overweight, grubby, hygenically-challenged Jackson Lamb, are the cast-offs of the elite MI-5. Put aside to rot in an old building for some screw up or another, they hurl insults at each other but...somehow manage to outwit and outsmart the agents still in good favor at MI-5.Whip smart writing and amazing acting in the part of all the characters really out together a show that entertains and captivates. Lots of twists and turns (although...honestly...some of them are predictable) and even some double-cross.Kristen Scott Thomas and Gary Oldman are utterly amazing in their roles.

There is no real plot or acting, in these 6 episodes there is either shootings or punch lines.

"This just needs you to give it 2 or 3 episodes and you'll realise is pretty great stuff. Love him/hate him, Gary Oldman is at once repulsive and hilarious. The full cast shine and the plot is nicely woven. Pay attention and this is a rewarding and disturbing take on MI5 and the world of spooks where those that shine may no longer be the flavour of the month.It's a little gruesome, the language is coarse but essential to the humour, and the story poses some intelligent questions about the classes, feelings and longings that get misplaced, underestimated and maybe shine again.In the end I was left wanting for more and it's great to see that there is another season on the way imminently. I must remind my sister to watch it. 😂",IMDB,Great writing & acting - requires a little patience,8.0
"IMO, it is rare for a spy ""thriller"""" to have layers. This one does.Great cast. Of late, in a few productions, I've appreciated the nuanced performances of some significant mature actors relative to the energy and emerging presence of younger actors as a mirror of the growth of the characters within the show. This one certainly has that in spades in a main character, and in one I hope reappears in the future. (Haven't seen Season Two as yet.)I suppose one thing that bugs me is the aggressively dismissive, bullying behaviour of one character, wouldn't put up with that for a minute but not doing so means leaving the Service, of course, and there goes the show. That, too, has a back story and I woke up this morning thinking of what the job of ""spook"" must do to personhood. In short, bring on Season Two.",IMDB,Intriguing back stories emerge,9.0

A brand new dilemma drops with and even bigger inclusion of the Slow Horses especially Lamb, Cartwright and Standish who all three share the spotlight.

"When I viewed Episode #1 of Season #1 of 'Slow Horses' I liked it so much that I wrote to friends hailing the series as sensational. Or close to it. But while it's good, the entirety is not nearly as good as I'd thought. As I'd hoped.Let me tell you why.1. There's too much 'fooling' and 'being fooled' in the story. In the first episode the viewer is fooled into thinking something calamitous has taken place. In later episodes characters are fooled by other characters into thinking something calamitous is about to take place. There is an overarching story to this Series; it will extend into Season #2 and possibly longer; and it's based on people being fooled into thinking an event is one thing when it's actually another. A favorite character turns out to be quite different than we were led to believe. A villain is revealed to not be one. And it goes on. And I'll bet, it will go on in later seasons as well. And yes, of course, fooling one-another is the point to the story; the way that British Intelligence is so caught up in it that they muck themselves up. I understand. But enough is enough. And for me - fooling-wise - this was too much.2. It's dark. By this I mean, a vast majority of it takes place at night and outdoors and more often than not it's hard to tell what's up. As for the daylight scenes, they're shot on what appear to be cloudy days; there is a heavy-lidded quality to London (where it's set); and after a while I found myself getting depressed.Here's what I liked:Gary Oldman as a grizzled, boozing Spy-Chief put out to pasture is spectacular. Jonathon Price as one who has retired is cold and calculating and likely will have an increasingly important role. Kristen Scott Thomas as a slightly lower level spy is cold and commanding when she can be, and somehow likable when it's safe for her to be.Young spies played by Jack Lowden and Olivia Cooke have just the chemistry for us to hope they 'get together'. While an older spy couple (Dustin Demri-Burns and Rosalind Eleazor) have already hooked up and are sensational in their bumbling roles. For me Chris Chung steals every scene he is in, as 'Ho', the high-tech wizard of the spy-team; full of attitude and surprises and - important - likability.The Story: There are two Spy Centers in London. 'The Park' which is slick and high-performing. And 'Slough' which is where outcast spies are outcasted to. The two centers are in constant competition, and it's no secret that our rooting interest is with 'Slough'. And when a young Muslim student is kidnapped by far-right anti-immigrant agitators, the two centers have to work with, and against, one another to save the young man's life. There is violence a'plenty, lots of it on-screen and over-the-top gruesome (so, be warned). Surprisingly this works well with the rather ironically humorous tone of much of the series. How the director accomplished this, beats me. But it does.Anyway, that's it. Very good. Not great. If I'm you, I'd give it a try.",IMDB,Another Series I Liked Less with each Episode,8.0
"Spies, Oldman, Jagger theme song.... Come on! What are you waiting for? Season Two pays off end of season One beautifully and I can't wait for season Three. If Oldman is serious about retiring, he could not go out in a better fitting suit if he tried 😊
Taking on where Le Carré and Smiley left off this perfectly pitched spy drama is both an homage to the past as personified by Jackson Lamb's ( Oldman's) rumpled nod to Inspector Columbo ( he even borrowed the raincoat but never laundered it,) and an introduction to the "" next gen"" in the person of River Cartwright's (Jack Lowden's) eager doggedness and Roddy Ho's ( Christopher Chung's) tech geek smarm.

"While most series follow ""what should be"" or at least ""what I would like to be"" this series is possibly ""what was"". There's drama and comedy that don't make sense for the first two cases, but actually follow ""what was"". Based on the cell phones and hard case files, this might've been a real scenario in...2007?Only done season one and can't care enough about the characters to go for season two. The opening scene was compelling, but then it's all a ruse? Then we have a real case with a psychopath, but we're making joke about agents running the wrong way?And really, our psychopath never really completes his line. He's essentially revealed as a player in the spook world in episode three, but then played as a psychopath until the end? Each play should've furthered either an alternate agenda or a criminally deranged mind, but we have to infer the latter.There's a few parting shots interspersed throughout the series about the relative station of the Slough Houses (aka Slow Horses), but not enough to care either way.

"I was checking out Apple TV on a trial basis (which is free) but could not find anything interesting to watch there.I ended up with ""Slow Horses"" because I like Gary Oldman.At first I did not know what to make of it.Gary Oldman (as Jackson Lamb) heads a strange department of MI5 (some kind of British FBI) - far, far away from the shiny headquarters.It is called ""Slough House"" and there they hide away all the losers and good-for-nothing agents who made some embarrassing, career-ending mistake.They are just a handful and Lamb tells them on every occasion he gets that they are useless and that he does not like them.Unless he is not farting while sleeping after drinking in his dirty office.These ""losers"" do very boring and tedious in a run down, dirty old building.And the show starts of like that - tedious, boring and dirty.But after one and a half episodes this changes.All the loser agents get their act together (well, at least a little bit) their grumpy boss actually does care about them (at least a little bit) and they stick up for each other (a little bit).Each season deals with one case.The ways these agents deal with these cases are always witty, there are a lot of twists and turns and it is just fun to watch.Sometimes the agents of ""Slough House"" solve a problem by doing something seemingly stupid which turns out to be clever in the end - or it is indeed stupid and they just get lucky when it ends well :)""Slow Horses"" is not some hard-boiled spy thriller like ""Smiley's People"", nor is it some silly comedy like ""Johnny English""It is something inbetween, like the thrilling yet funny James Bond movies with Roger Moore, or ""The Avengers"" TV series with Diana Rigg.""Slow Horses"" does not take itself too seriously, it is fast paced and entertaining and I really enjoyed watching it :)",IMDB,Witty and sometimes silly but always fun to watch :),8.0

This is a great show but the Oldman character and never too others are just a little over the top this series. Would you really fart in someone's car or wear such crappy and grubby clothes.

The two 'dogs' characters, Duffy and Hobbs come straight out of a cheap and nasty 1970s ITV police drama; overacted and completely unbelievable.

At some points it seems to be a wacky comedy - see the lead River sparring with an enemy in episode one. I couldn't work out if it was a parody or not. But for serious topics like bombings and beheadings, it comes across as silly and lacks any gravity.The acting is pretty bad too at many of the guest actors, and just witness the comedy club scene for acting absurdity.

Strong actors, and the story moves from slow to intriguing. Just love watching Oldman'swork.",IMDB,One Word : Oldman,10.0
This is one of the best spy dramas I've seen in a long time. Gary Oldman's dry wit is so right for this group with a lot of redirection. Shifts in what you think you know about characters and situations are constantly changing. The finale of the first season is quite a shock. We need more seasons of this.,IMDB,Don't let the title deter you,10.0
"Though the story-line is ok, half of this show is filmed in complete darkness. TV brightness is turned all the way up, and I still can't see action on the screen. It might as well be a radio production. In older productions one sees the action, even when it happens (supposedly) at night.Every character is unlovable, even the (one must assume) protagonist of the series.",IMDB,Like most modern productions - almost completely black,3.0
"Good to see the America's fascination with wokeness has crossed the pond. Unfortunately for me, I like every character. The problem is the story line. Sorry but Ep.1 did it for me.

"Excellent characters, with credible backstories and complex relationships - started off with such high expectations and a proper storyline! Lots of good subtext with alcoholism/addiction being a character in its own.And real enemies of the state and terrorists. Then it got boring...
By season 3, MI5 is so bored with themselves and irrelevant that they needed to create their own drama? Kidnapping their own and even resorting to killing their own. Luckily the ridiculous caricature Spider was due for a cull! And the Zombie attack road-sign just emphasized the utter boredom. How does this get any worse? Starts as an 8/10, but very soon devolved to at most a 3/10. Grey books...very light grey...",IMDB,Soon running out of steam,5.0

"The Bad:
The acting:
Some of the acting is decent, but the writing is so consistently lousy that there's only so much the poor actors can actually do.The writing:
Just terrible. And I mean 'Killing Eve' (post season 1) terrible. Except worse, because this isn't supposed to be a comedy (or is it??). Implausible scenarios, implausible unbelievable character actions, hammy terrible dialogue, sub-one--dimensional characters and effectively NO likeable characters.The Good:
Nothing. And i don't say that lightly. Literally NOTHING.I made it about 40 mins through episode two and spent the remainder of the day in a foul mood because this was so terrible. Some great actors, utterly wasted - worse than wasted.....mauled with this shocking excuse for drama. I'd give it 0 if I would - '1' is generous and wrong.",IMDB,where to start?,1.0
"At some point, and it is taking a whole lot longer than I think is reasonable, the 50% or more of western audiences who identify as center right are going to start punishing shows that indulge in the incessant, tedious army of straw men approach to characterizing politics. In the first episode they depict a political figure speaking about the problems of illegal immigration in the U. K. in terms that are pretty reasonable, and the writers can't help jabbing at the guy and branding him a fascist anyway. I would be more surprised if it was the BBC that produced the show, but this is Apple+.Then again, I guess that should not shock me since Apple+ is doing its level best to keep its fat corporate thumb on the same scale.Gary Oldman is hilarious. I hope when I hit that age I'll be unapologetically drunk, farting, and still the best at what I do. That man could play my mother and be more convincing than she was. I keep looking at him and marveling that the same guy was Winston Churchill, Sid Vicious, Commissioner Gordon, George Smiley, Dracula, and Drexl the pimp from True Romance all in one career.And he did all of those pretty well. (The Dracula flick was awful but he was still pretty good in it.)So I'm still watching and hoping it redeems itself, but the show is indulging in The Message a bit heavy-handedly. Hollywood is soon going to have real competition from streaming services and production houses that make more than enough right leaning entertainment to make the old regime irrelevant to much of its audience, so it needs to learn to mind its collective manners.Slow Horses had such potential and its producers are wasting it. Yes, it got great reviews and plenty of support from some quarters. Those reviews and those quarters seem to be weighted a bit heavily, so if you're one of those terrible fascists they keep talking about, you may find Slow Horses incredibly aggravating and impossible to follow without a thick skin.",IMDB,"Tedious, slow, and annoying...",5.0
"The story is OK, but the dramatic parts are undermined by the mostly failed attempts at comedy. Kristin Scott Thomas is good, but I have no idea why Gary Oldman apparently believes he's in a farce. The rest of the cast are quite nondescript.",IMDB,Mediocre,5.0
"What a disappointment this season is. Cracks started to appear in season 2, but season 3 is the chasm. The plot is simply silly and the direction and acting (apart from Oldman) are risible. We have the (quite cringe-worthy) modern impetus to include (expletive obsessed) female characters in the most (implausibly) physical roles, and gratuitous male rear nudity (while assiduously avoiding any female nudity). Yawn.The critical assessment, in my view, says more about the capacity of the reviewers to critcally assess than it does about the actual series.Gary Oldman is clearly involved in this for the money. And why not? But in the cold light of his old-age he will regret appearances in rubbish like this.",IMDB,So disappointing,2.0
"The current elite really have no shame. If you're a subservient aspirant eager to serve the current elite, you might laugh along with the portrayed crimes committed against native English people.But for normal people, this thinly veiled propaganda is really quite tiresome.The leader of the team is an alcoholic radical communist who threatens his subordinates with a stint in a Siberian gulag. This happens after two far-leftist white operatives are caught in the office complaining about a nationalist politician. Even then, they're not quite radical enough for him.One of the former secret police leaders (Jonathan Pryce) is an even more radical anti-native activist. After lamenting about the ""loathsome drift to the far right,"" he gives the protagonist an abhorrent look and then reveals that the secret state police should've been even more anti-native.The current childless white girlboss of the secret police laments the oversized budget she was given to monitor Islamists (who, in reality, commit most terror crimes) as she wanted to focus on crushing far-right groups due to her personal political animus.All of the top brass and the other agents are presented as sophisticated elites, just looking out for the global elite. They're groomed at wealthy establishments and are horrified while watching a nationalist politician decry a terrorist attack, viewing the mainstream media as if it were an objective entity justifying their actions.None of the stuff in the first three episodes wasn't even a cheap set-up for a later reversal; this is what the show is about. This is truly one of the most devious anti-European propaganda shows I've seen.The regime's secret police, which we're supposed to like, know about every meeting their political enemies have ever held, followed by them threatening their enemies with NKVD-tier torture, and we're just supposed to brush this off as a good thing because a girlboss does it. The NKVD girlboss then dispatches a spook to murder a journalist, and that's also portrayed as a good thing.Yeah, even Stalin would be embarrassed by this propaganda.",IMDB,Even Stalin wouldn't have dared to release such obvious propaganda,1.0

"OK, I'll admit right away that I haven't read the original on which this series is based and I've only watched the opening episode so far.Having got that out of the way, this appears to be the recipe - a pinch of Jed Mercurio here (opening sequence in the airport), a tablespoon of Jesse Armstrong/Ricky Gervais there (dialogue banter and insults), mix in a bit Tinker, Tailor casting and set decor, add a soupçon of Killing Eve's knowing and ironic yet gratuitous violence (I expect) and there you have Slow Horses, a kind of comedy-thriller salad but one with ingredients that don't quite gel together.After a fairly efficient if standard issue 'exciting' opening, the pace suddenly lurches to a near stall in the following exposition. Key characters are introduced. Lazy, cantankerous departmental boss whose persona doubtless disguises wily ways - check. Sharp and snappy love interest - check. Assorted no hopers with back stories (no doubt) - check.And the set up, when it comes, isn't remotely plausible. Would an audience of millennials really walk out on a dud standup with a line in mildly offensive religious jokes? I don't think so. Would the far right kidnappers really threaten a beheading? Isn't that the sort of thing they are nominally opposed to?I'm not saying the far right is not dangerous. I happen to know that it posses a far greater threat than supposedly Islamic terrorists but please try to give them some villainous credibility.I might give the next episode a go but frankly, I'm a bit tired of these content-by-numbers shows.",IMDB,A bit of a hotchpotch,5.0

"Cringeworthy, at times ridiculously and unbelievable plot lines with silly character decision-making for so-called 'MI5 agents', acting likewise is at times awful from some of the supporting 'actors'.

The grouchy boss who wears grungy clothes and smokes and has a dirty, untidy office - wow! How original, how thought-provoking, how did the writers ever dream up such an original character.

"The writers seem stuck in the 6th grades boys room as gutter language and an almost religious reliance on the F-word seems to be their only way f expressing an opinion. This could have been the BBC rescue of the US series Chaos, but find a writer who can lay down a plotline without profanity, graphic gore and graphic sex is like finding another Hope Diamond. A show that managed this is the now gone New Tricks, a similar plotline where castoffs manage to do what their supposed betters could not. Humor does not have to be juvenile to be funny, scatalogical can be relegated to the wastenbasket without harming anything, and in fact it would increase the audience.

"I created the IMDB account just so I can review this series.I watched the first two seasons and liked them very much. The casting is good. Dialogs are witty. Oldman is great.Then I decided to read the books. It is obvious that the creators of the series did not really like the books. Otherwise, they would not have changed so much. They stuck to the general ideas of the books, but thought they could do better. If so, why did they not come up with their own ideas instead?I just watched the first episode of season 3 and decided to quit watching the rest. Almost everything is different. What the f?This is not the only example of people making TV shows and films based on books and changing just about everything that makes the books so good. After all they inspired them to make the shows and films. So, why not be faithful to the books.I suppose they think they can do better.The lesson: either read the books or watch the shows. If you do both you will be disappointed.",IMDB,Stick with the books,5.0
"The initial setup was promising, with intriguing characters and a seemingly compelling plotline. However, the show's potential quickly derailed in the first episode. A central threat, presented as a serious concern to the elite MI5, turned out to be a thinly veiled caricature of Nigel Farage. This decision was not only disappointing but also insensitive. By mocking genuine anxieties held by many British citizens about immigration, the series alienated a significant portion of its potential audience. The show's portrayal of those with such concerns as ""Nazis"" was a particularly offensive oversimplification.",IMDB,Dissapointing,1.0
"This series tells its stories in a very confused and chaotic manner. The narrative unfolds in a completely nonlinear manner and viewers have to fill in a lot of gaps in order to follow and in many instances, create continuity and additional content in order to make the episodes and characters understandable. The acting is fine but the story telling simply sucks. The first season started this trend and the second season has amplified the bizarre technique even further. Never having heard of or read the novel on which this is based one doesn't know if it's written in an equally chaotic style. The series is watchable, just chaotic and confusing!",IMDB,Confused and chaotic,5.0
"Wow, I really am going to have start taking IMDB ratings with a huge pinch of salt. How is this so highly rated?!Every episode needs the 'Eastenders drums' at its climax. The plots are ridiculous, how it unfolds is even more ridiculous and if MI5 were remotely like any of this lot, jeez we're in trouble!Am I missing something I wonder, is it just a bad comedy, with terrible wooden acting?I watched S1 to see if it would get any better, it didn't and ****spolier***
How can someone who's been smacked around the head with an axe get up and carry on?It was mooted that S2 had a bigger budget, so okay I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt... oh dear, just hilarious, nothing is believable, nor does it make sense!But, if you want a real laugh then S3 is for you!

I guess the writers and directors don't know either. Amazingly stupid dialog along the way. I went through 3 seasons, hoping it might get better, but all in vain - it gets worse so, I'm at the end. What happened to Gary Oldman - he was an interesting actor once working in decent productions now playing a disgusting slob!I guess all the great reviews come out of old England, as this seems to be a 'required taste'.
