"3 Body Problem is an adaptation with all the ingredients for success, but it doesn’t match the original material’s efforts doesn’t to create something unique and compelling.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"This is a big, brilliant, and beautiful sci-fi epic that was worth the wait.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
3 Body Problem won’t be for everyone – but it’s an elegant solution. … This is an absorbing scientific mystery that rewards alert viewers.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Despite some flashes of sci-fi prowess, it never fully takes off due to a script so uneven that ends up alienating our interest. [Full Review in Spanish]",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"This series builds a world below the surface where who where are and our place in time, space and the galaxy are all up for discussion.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Liu Cixin’s hard science fiction epic is much more than alien threats with more emphasis on the cultural revolutions and human problems,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The result is a confused mishmash: The rational, scientific side of the story isn’t coldly detailed enough to captivate, and its emotional side feels too superficial or muddled to cut deep.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Netflix has taken an introspective story about the depression and nihilism inherent in collective scientific possibility and turned it into a romantic narrative about the individualist triumph of those people smart enough to drive scientific progress.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Perhaps everything happens too quickly, maybe some characters need more room and the viewer needs a break. But the plot is surprising, it intensifies and delivers a twist to the current debate about where technology is taking us. [Full review in Spanish]",Rotten Tomatoes,,
It asks a series of interesting questions and presents a string of intriguing SciFi ideas in the process. It results in an engaging and mysterious series that will keep viewers invested from start to finish.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Fascinating ideas and concepts are presented in an intriguing, accesible and entertaining way, while the human characters (scientist core group) leave a lot to be desired. [Full review in Spanish]",Rotten Tomatoes,,
3 Body Problem remains grounded in human drama.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
Visually spectacular and a good cast — Wong in particular.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Based on Cixin Liu’s megapopular sci-fi novels, 3 Body Problem is an engrossing spectacle about alien invasion. It’s a welcome 21st-century twist on the old War of the Worlds premise.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Offering plenty of thought-provoking and mind-bending conceits, 3 Body is not exactly casual viewing, but it’s a show that rewards close attention.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
I really enjoyed the series in spite of most of the leads either being annoying or just not clicking with me as the actual sci-fi and general concepts presented were so good.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The show confidently takes its audience into uncharted territory, peeling back mystery after mystery.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"For those who love their sci-fi with a healthy dose of mind-bending concepts, high stakes, and a slow burn that explodes into pure sci-fi brilliance.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Episode 5 is easily one of the best TV episodes of the year. 3 Body Problem has a wonderful cast and stunning visuals, but the final 3 episodes feel a little anti-climatic in this slow-burn series.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Ambitious, towering and crammed with big ideas about intellectual curiosity, exploration and our place in the universe while still managing to tell intimate stories about human relationships.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem presents an interesting theoretical scenario, with some compelling characters and a few dynamics that are worth exploring. But despite the revolutionary source material, the show isn’t all that groundbreaking, at least not yet.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"As big idea sci-fi goes, this is deeply impressive in both spectacle and substance.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"A misfire in every way, 3 Body Problem has some talented actors delivering some memorable moments, but none of it adds up to an experience that is satisfying, fulfilling, or even all that enjoyable.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Most plots these days seem to be driven by characters’ stupid mistakes and bad decisions. It’s refreshing to witness intelligent characters grappling with a predicament that is not of their own making.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem’s most prominent deviation from the source material adds inclusion, which pays off creatively and commercially.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It has a different approach than most Netflix originals, but there's also the certainty that it doesn't quite take off. [Full review in Spanish]",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Is it terrible? No, absolutely not. It’s enjoyable, it’s high production value sci-fi, it’s going places, it’s high stakes, it’s large scope and scale, it asks interesting questions. But is it great? Sadly, no.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"I get a kick out of realizing which portions of the trilogy the show’s creators have chopped up and rearranged, delighted to be shown parallels among characters... and still find Benioff and Weiss to be great at writing memorable, economical dialogue.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"A mind-bending sci-fi epic spanning multiple decades, while also reaching centuries into the past and future, it can scarcely be faulted for lack of ambition, but sometimes there's just too much going on to digest properly.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"... The series asserts itself as an immersive experience, a broad map in which time and space converge in search of answers to a riddle that isn't easy to solve. [Full review in Spanish]",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The series juggles the perspectives and quandaries of its flawed and confused scientists with sympathy and nuance. The dialogue is intelligent, witty and believable.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Based on the way this season all but runs out of momentum at the finale, its ticking countdown may come to an end sooner than later.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem suffers from a concept-heavy, near-indigestible opening episode (you may need a couple of tea breaks to get through it). After that, it can be mind-blowing...",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem’s first season works as a solid introduction to this world, but by the finale, it becomes clear that these episodes are really just laying the groundwork for an even bigger, more deeply complicated narrative.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Taking the Chinese-centric story, moving it to England, and creating a tapestry of characters based on several of the novel’s key characters, 3 Body Problem is a valiant attempt at translating a novel that has been called unadaptable to the small screen.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"...the strength and weakness is that these sci-fi concepts come from Chinese culture; that makes them different to the ones we’re bored rigid with, but original or not, they still have to be sold to us… intellectual engagement is slow out of the gate...",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Netflix's 3 Body Problem plays things too safe, edgy and drab despite the book's wild vision.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The show should be a celebration, a statement, a home run swing. Instead its style is anonymous, the work of a corporate author rather than an artistic intelligence.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
3 Body Problem weaves philosophical quandaries into a propulsive science fiction tale with such audacity that I don’t mind that it doesn't always pull it off. At least it shoots for the stars.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"As the characters in 3 Body Problem lurch toward answers, we all get to bask in an ambitious narrative fueling an ultimately impressive tale. Just remember to be patient as the series sets the stage early on.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
This is predominantly out-of-this-world viewing with a down-to-earth quality thanks to the characters at the core of the story.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Brilliantly produced, pacy and featuring excellent performances, it provides food for the brain as well as a feast for the eyes.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The back half of the season is consistently compelling, and sometimes downright thrilling, especially any time its characters simply put their heads together to solve the three-body problem at hand.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Exploring that horrific human past of madness, violence, and cowardly compliance is the best part of Netflix’s 3 Body Problem.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The most eagerly anticipated TV series of the year is here, from the brains behind Game of Thrones and their mesmerizing mind games bring a Chinese literary classic about alien invasion to life. You'll have to work hard to untangle its mysteries. Do it.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"A high-octane, multi-level AI adventure, as outrageous and stunning as the plots all interconnected to the tiniest details; so it sweeps and hides, crammed with anxiety-provoking prose warning of end times.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The existential crisis explored in the series, and the possible human responses to it, feel more relevant than ever after living through a global pandemic. It's terrifying. And very good TV.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem is as reflective and dangerous as a shard of broken glass, that you can't help but touch because of its possibilities.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem works because the characters are set up well in the first episode, and the mystery at its center is truly a mystery, not just pieces of missing information that the writers are keeping from frustrated viewers.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Once the stakes for the human race and Earth’s eventual invaders become clear, 3 Body Problem develops an “Oxford Five” problem...",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Netflix’s new sci-fi series from the makers of Game of Thrones doesn’t just honor Liu Cixin’s remarkable books—it improves on them.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"I love these books, and it appears this show understands why: the dead seriousness but also the absurdity, the abstruseness but also the silliness, the hardcore science but also the prestige-TV-ain’t-dead-yet art.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"What you also need to know, though, is it’s brilliant. Yes, it’s complicated. Yes, it’s chaotic. No, you will not always understand what is going on... But the vision of it!",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Whatever captivated American readers when the novel was first translated into English in 2014 is barely evident in this ungainly, forgettable TV series.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Just when it seems there’s nothing original to watch, “3 Body Problem” falls from the skies.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Don’t be deceived by the interplanetary intrigue: humanity’s worth, and what we deserve for our collective failings, are at the heart of this deftly capable science-fiction puzzle-box.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"This is a story about sacrifice and the ability to be concerned about more than the moment you’re in, and when faced with these kinds of large, ruminative dilemmas... yet somehow 3 Body Problem does not, in any way, feel urgent.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Sometimes the universe winks at us and we can’t figure out if that’s a provocation, a flirtation, or the side effects of some strong smoke. This adaptation makes finding out engrossing, if not altogether simple. What theory worth parsing is?",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"When a book is deemed “unadaptable”, it is almost interpreted as a challenge. Of course, no book is really unadaptable; the problem is that rendering it on screen will simply be too dull, or confusing. 3 Body Problem is somehow both.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
This show proceeds with such a steady hand as to remain highly watchable throughout what amounts to this extended overture.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
3 Body Problem also falls into the trap of alienating its emotional depth from its own physics musings.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Benioff and Weiss have been slammed for their unsatisfying final season of Game of Thrones, but, so far, 3 Body Problem reestablishes their reputations as top-notch adaptors.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"If your favourite kind of screen sci-fi is the thoughtful variety represented by films such as Contact and Arrival, you’ll be over the moon for much of the series.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Conspiracies, mysterious cabals, VR games, religious cults, issues spanning modern history, and science. It is a lot, but the plotting is excellent and the series is challenging enough to make it interesting, but easy enough to follow.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The rare series that consistently surprises, making me (mostly) forget my worries during initial episodes that this could be another “Lost,” a show with great ideas but no concrete story path.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"This to me was a solid philosophical sci-fi story that is a genre bending experience that combined science, technology, humanity, scope and scale but doesn't do it all equally and effectively, due to its lackluster character drama!",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It’s the equivalent of a cheap house flip, gutting a beautiful midcentury structure and redoing every room in shades of millennial gray.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Benioff, Weiss and Woo took a book trilogy known more for its thought experiments in philosophy and theoretical physics than its plot and made a solid bit of hard sci-fi that is (mostly) accessible to more casual fans of the genre.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"There is plenty to like about 3 Body Problem. It presents thorny physics in a tangible, entertaining way, particularly in its VR-enabled flights of fancy to ancient China and Tudor England.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Nothing about this series is small. It’s visually lavish, narratively rich and more than compelling enough to overcome its moments of coldness",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"A collection of mysteries that, while rarely boring, is too untidy to consistently grip the imagination.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It won’t be Netflix’s answer to Game of Thrones. But Benioff, Weiss, and their collaborator Alexander Woo have undoubtedly proved yet again that there is no such thing as an unfilmable novel.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem suffers from being overly stylish and lacking substance. You can easily be reeled into a world visually, but if there isn’t anything worth sticking around for, you will check out.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The 3 Body Problem goes from the serious to the ridiculous and banal, from being a good example of the genre to being pretentious, didactic, and broad. The result, therefore, is as contradictory as it is uneven. [Full review in Spanish]",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The parts have been originally arranged, with fresh trimmings, good characters and some clever use of theoretical physics; “3 Body Problem” doesn’t feel like a retread.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
Most of 3 Body Problem’s adaptation choices just feel like failed attempts to spice things up.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"With 3 Body Problem, the showrunners have created a truly remarkable and hugely ambitious piece of television that will have viewers hanging onto every plotline, hungry to find out more about its hidden mysteries and meanings.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"If one thing holds it back from greatness, it’s the characters, who could have used some alien technology to lend them an extra dimension or two. But the series’s scale and mind-bending turns may leave you too starry-eyed to notice.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
The story's themes of collective dependence within humanity and the value of loyal friendships work to create a narrative that is memorable and captivating. The biggest hesitation with this show is whether it will be allowed to continue the story.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It’s well paced, generally compelling, and completely committed to being the most TV version of itself it can possibly be. If only more Netflix dramas did the same.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It may wear the garb of prestige television, but underneath it’s just a nerdy science-fiction show, with a healthy emphasis on the science.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"... A tired, heavy, slow and drawn-out resolution that is finally expressed in three long yawns. [Full review in Spanish]",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Characters saddled with explaining abstruse mechanical theories, meanwhile, never really seem to have more than one dimension themselves. Still, there’s sufficient intrigue and splashy production to keep enough of us watching...",Rotten Tomatoes,,
The expansive spectacle of the “3 Body Problem” and the awe it occasionally produces is often hindered by its inherently middling human melodramas and tortuous plotting,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Netflix's 3 Body Problem succeeds in creating an expansive world filled with intriguing mysteries, delivering both personal moments and spectacle.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem is a stunningly ambitious adaptation of an unwieldy science fiction text, bringing both humanity and existential terror to its otherwise analytical approach.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The themes are fascinating, the ideas fresh, and with a bit of fine-tuning, it could be great; here’s hoping Netflix bucks the trend and renews it for a second season.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The series inherits some terrific sci-fi horror concepts from the best selling novels and adds a warm character drama. It helps if you have an interest in physics and engineering, but it works.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The background material is weak, and the new ideas are virtually all depressingly familiar.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem reworks Cixin Liu’s mammoth book trilogy for a wider audience to great success, though it may annoy some viewers with its far-out sci-fi and speed-of-light plot machinations.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
The Netflix adaptation of 3 Body Problem sets a new standard for what sci-fi is capable of.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem functions perfectly well on a character level, so if you're happy to accept a healthy dose of scientific malarkey, then you're golden.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem moves at a brisk, often breakneck speed to convey a sense of spectacle and awe. But in the process, it sacrifices the thing that made Three-Body so singular in the first place: the science.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem just doesn’t know what to do with its terrestrial cast of characters, and the globalization of its cast dulls what was otherwise a distinctly Chinese perspective with the original novel.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"... Benioff, Weiss, and Woo remind us in 3 Body Problem how good an adaptation can be when it’s done properly — and might have just stumbled on making Netflix’s next masterpiece.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Despite some clunky characterization, the series is an ambitious and inventive piece of sci-fi.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It really helps that Netflix didn’t skimp on 3 Body Problem, which, for all its character drama, goes big when it needs to go big.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem may fail to inspire true awe, but there’s enough fun, shock, and horror to keep sci-fi fans engaged.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"A hugely ambitious adaptation of a hugely ambitious book. As an opening season it feels like set-up for something bigger — but what’s here is thoroughly impressive, giant-scale television.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"A glorious, gaudy galactic mess. Problems? Loads of them. But marvel at the ambition.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Benioff, Weiss, and Woo have been remarkably successful at transforming Liu’s work into a gripping sci-fi thriller, without either dumbing it down or boring viewers with hours’ worth of whiteboard lectures.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It’s rare to see this kind of hard sci-fi on-screen, with the financial foundations in place to fully realize what is a complex and brazen vision of our world.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"The series isn’t devoid of good stuff. It’s just flat, with decorative touches, which extends to the characterizations and acting.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It's grounded in a solid sci-fi premise, but continually weighed down by flat, often two-dimensional characters and a weak script.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem certainly has its high points, but the convolution of plot manages to damper any goodwill the episodes conjure up with the audience.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"It’s an absolute page-turner that confidently switches modes and genres, acting as a strong comeback for Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"What really makes the series work is the characters, and although they may be slow to grow on you, you’ll be rooting for them by the end.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"Even with these various smart deviations from the source material, the show’s first season is middling drama at best. And while the interplanetary spectacle is meant to be grand, little of it comes close to replicating the awe [from Game of Thrones].",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"At the same time that “3 Body Problem” grounds its story in a crew of curious young people, the show also imbues a sense of geeky grandeur.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
The fact is 3 Body Problem is pedestrian at best when it should be epic — and that’s a problem.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
“3 Body Problem” offers little personal intrigue to balance its increasingly unimpressive attempts at spectacle.,Rotten Tomatoes,,
"3 Body Problem spectacular world building sparks and excites the mind, body, and soul.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"While not a slavishly faithful adaptation, the show captures the spirit of Liu’s writing, while setting in motion the unfeasibly grandiose space epic that is still to come.",Rotten Tomatoes,,
"I went into this completely blind--never read the books or saw the Chinese version, and only knew it was a sci-fi show by the guys from GoT. So I had no expectations. I thought it was good, but something was missing that kept it from being great.The production was good, but not inspiring. The acting was good, but I never really felt emotionally connected to the characters, although I came close with Jin. It would have been nice to have more background and world building to become more vested in the story and characters.The plot itself was fine enough, but events seemed to unfold quite quickly without ever showing any effort. A lot happened, but it lacked depth. I thought it was good enough to watch another season, but it didn't really knock my socks off at any point. Good enough, I suppose.",IMDB,"Good, but not great",7.0
3 Body Problem is here and it did not disappoint. First of all I've never read any of the books so I have nothing to compare it to or be disappointed about. It looks like most people do like it but there are those who won't because it's not exactly like the book but it's hard to adapt a good book to a show or movie. As long as it's still entertaining then who cares? Just take it for what it is and that's a really good sci-fi series. They've been talking about and hyping this show up for years now. The creators of Game of Thrones (David Benioff and D. B. Weiss) are the creators of this show and that brings a lot of expectations with it. I'm glad they released it on Netflix so we get all the episodes at one time because I couldn't stop watching. I'm glad they already renewed for two more seasons so they can finish the story because everyone knows there's nothing more frustrating than a show getting cancelled before they conclude the story. They now know they have 2 more full seasons to finish it. Can't wait!,IMDB,Hooked me from the start,8.0
At the time of this writing the show has a 7.9 rating. I suspect in time this will go down to around 7.2 although personally I think it deserves a 6.Too harsh? I don't think so. While I didn't hate the show and am not one of those people who need or expect all adaptations to adhere strictly to the source material I think if you are going to make changes in your adaptation they should make sense and make some sort of improvement. This show failed on both scores. The original books by author Cixin Liu were hard sci-fi and brilliant in scope and imagination. The adaptation dumbs down the source material for TV and makes changes to appease the political viewers. None of this is an improvement. All it achieves is it takes everything that made the books so different from everything else out there and turns it into the same kind of Hollywood tripe that's a dime a dozen these days.,IMDB,Mediocre Body Problem,6.0
"The story is decent but whoever wrote the characters and most of the dialogue needs to goJin and Auggie are simply unsufferable. Auggie seems unable to go 10 lines without swearing. They always seem on the verge of throwing a tantrum. Like it's literally making it difficult to watch because I feel attacked through the screen. I know this is the idea that some writers have about ""strong women"" but I don't think it's working. Also why do they react to everything by getting mad lmao aren't they scientists?Enough has been said about Will's only character traits being that he has cancer and he can't propose to Jin. He's unsufferableWade and the detective are so stereotyped that it becomes laughable at times. Sometimes Wade says ""cool stuff"" that doesn't even make senseI'm sorry because the story is good but so much revolved around these unsufferable characters, and I suppose it will going forward since we aren't going to see the Aliens for a couple hundred years.",IMDB,Who wrote these characters and dialogue?,7.0
"First two episodes are confusing but in an good way. Show builds op strong for me. Episode 3, 4 and 5 very strong.But then, from like episode 5 the focus shifts to the most annoying character i have witnessed in a long time: Auggie.I dont know if it is a bad actress or a good one and Auggie is ment to be this annoying but is a very hard watch.At some point you just want to skip every scene she is in. I have still one episode left and my god i hope the character is written off.So now I have 98 words left to typ but i just wanded to express my hate for this character nothing more. Finished.",IMDB,A poorly written character (Auggie) ruins it for the rest,7.0
"I just can't understand how this show got such an high score, I can tell you right away that it doesn't deserve it at all.This is from someone who hasn't read the books yet so I am reviewing it as a tv show only, and not how well it adapts the books.I love the base idea, it touches science, religion, the basics of human nature, it has so many opportunities for a great show... BUT.. jesus, this was so badly executed, it really shows how good those two GoT ""creators"" are, I have a feeling that with these books they either didn't have all of the world background and details to use or they just completely ignored them, while with GoT they had most of the work done for them.This series to me is very similar to Manifest (which was another awful show), the camera work, the cgi, the characters act almost the same way.Talking about the characters none of these make any sense, none of these are believable in any way, the cast was completely wrong apart from Liam Cunningham but even his role seems so badly written that it is painful to watch.The scientist characters seem to be acting for a soap opera, we have so many great examples of great scientists in the world, great communicators and rational, why not just take ideas from them... none of the ones in the show make any sense, they all look like models trying to pass for scientists, and for some reason they are the only ones in the world that can solve all the problems, they are boring, over dramatic and most aren't even interested in the problem... We are talking about communicating with aliens, we are talking about humanity demise and they just act it like it is Covid or whatever...Now, characters are definitely the worse, but not the only bed thing, some ideas and events in the show just make no sense at all, not because they are complex ideas but because they are so dumb, let me list a couple:
aliens are in a way already on earth and can literally see and do anything.. which begs the question why don't they just destroy everything alreadyscientists and their work was already being killed before aliens even learn about humans being liars, but they use that scene as the big shift in human alien relationsthe old chinese lady gets a message from the aliens when the first contact happens that warns her about what would really happen if she responds, she still responds... Later on she acts all surprised when aliens turn against us,... You really can't make this up !the only way to stop a boat passing a canal is by cutting it into pieces with some amazing new material the model scientist created all by herself ... This is so painful to even write..the world is doomed and the only people working to save humanity are a couple of british scientists in an old mansionthat tatiana character has superpowers? What the hell? Is that given by the aliens somehow but never explained?There are much more things that make no sense in this show, literally Manifest, the divine consciousness is the San-ti, OMG !!",IMDB,"Not good, boring and badly written",8.0
"This adaptation is largely faithful to the book, if your definition of faithful is ""major events that happened in the books also happened in this show"". The whole thing is rushed, and there is no time to let the events sink in. The first episode already covers half the first book. The mystery of what's behind the scientists' deaths and the thrill of the main characters uncovering the culprit are missing entirely from the show. The divide between the two branches of the three body organization is completely omitted. And where are the pendulums? The hard science that makes the source material so appealing is also ""less hard"" here. Two episodes in, we've already arrived at the famous ""Do Not Answer"" scene and know it's aliens. Despite having only 8 episodes, episodes 6 and 7 are nonsense fillers and by episode 8 we're already at book 2.I don't mind the screenwriters adapting characters to a more international audience, splitting and combining some main characters so they can interact with each other because you can't really have an inner monologue like in a fiction. But it makes zero sense that ""everybody knows everybody"" or that some early- to mid-thirties are heads of research centers. The epic feeling is gone because the show is made too UK-centric. Different genders and ethnic groups are ""represented"", but somehow they all have a British (Oxford) upbringing. Major world powers including the US, Japan, continental Europe, and Chinese-Chinese (not British Chinese) are not represented at all. This work is supposed to be an epic that spans the globe, and spans centuries. Yet watching the ""Oxford Five""'s relationship issues, it feels like teenage drama instead.While I might sound negative, this work is miles ahead of whatever's crapping out of Disney/Marvel/SW these days. The CGI is fantastic, especially when it comes to visualizing the VR world. The C******* Revolution backstory is meticulously filmed, and the entire Chinese storyline, however short it is, is spoken in Chinese. I am delighted to see Chinese Sci-Fi being adapted for Western audience, hence +1 star for representation. Nonetheless, as with most shows these days though, please hire more competent writers.",IMDB,Mostly faithful but rushed,6.0
"The Fermi Paradox mashed up with the Cultural Revolution? Benedict Wong? What's not to like? And for the first three or so episodes 3 Body Problem meets those expectations. Strange things are happening in 2024. All the physics we've ever known seems to be wrong. What's going on?Unfortunately, once the characters have established the quandary they're in, the rest of the series flatlines as they try to figure out what to do.I stuck with it, getting increasingly exasperated, expecting everything to be resolved after 8 episodes. Spoiler alert: nothing gets resolved, and the makers appear set to spin out 3 Body Problem into as many seasons as they can before reaching an ending that one does hope they've given some thought to. Me? I won't be watching any further seasons. As season one huffs and puffs into its second half, key characters fail to develop, and it's remarkable how little each episode moves the plot forward in any engaging sense.8/10 for establishing the quandary; 4/10 for the attempt to solve it - although there *is* one terrific scene that plays out in the Panama Canal.Benedict Wong, alone among the main characters, shines throughout: his entertainingly droll performance makes him one of the only interesting characters in this otherwise disappointing series.",IMDB,"Starts well, then it's all downhill",3.0
"What did you expect from Dumb & Dumber (murderers of GoT) ?This show can seem smart at first, but the more you think about it, the more you'll find it profoundly stupid.Those aliens make no sense at all. They were already slaughtering scientists before getting mad at Evans because of a stupid metaphor. By the way, they are using metaphors in their stupid game !Also, these aliens talk way too much. It's like in a video game, when you play badly on purpose, because you're bored and you want to lose.They're overpowered but they do nothing. They could wipe us out in a minute, but for some reason, they don't.There are so many stupid scenes in this show. For example, the infamous ship scene. They want us to believe there was no other way to do it. So stupid...
Do you remember this James Bond movie that was mocked because Denise Richards played a nuclear scientist ? This is the same here. Of course our supermodel Eiza Gonzalez is a head researcher in nanotechnology. Of course she is.Also, it feels like the whole fate of the human civilization revolves around a group of young partygoers. They want us to believe these people are the top scientists on Earth, but they keep behaving like stupid teenagers. No one cares about their love stories.Seriously, don't bother...",IMDB,Much more stupid than you think,8.0
"I've been looking forward to 3 Body Problem for what feels like a decade. I just binged the entire first season in two days and it's everything I hoped it would be and more. This series is adapted from the best selling novels of the same name. It's a show that will pull you into their world and not let go. There are so many mysteries that will keep your mind going the entire time. You can tell they put a lot of money into this show too because the visuals are absolutely beautiful. The only thing that could've been better was character development. I stole this quote from a review I read but I couldn't agree more, ""3 Body Problem sets a new standard for what sci-fi is capable of."" I'm already looking forward to next season. It can't come fast enough.",IMDB,Next season can't come fast enough,6.0
"I liked the contemplative nature of this show, but it quite quickly degraded into silliness, and disappointingly so, because it started off pretty well.We need shows like this one promised to be, but the clues were there right from the start with the annoying constantly smoking cast. Brought to you by the same people who scuttled 7 years of game of thrones with a half ar$ed 8th series. Interestingly this series was 8 episodes long but the show runners killed the show well before the final episode, so I guess that's progress for them, condensing 8 years of disappointment down into an eight episode arc.I don't know what to think after finishing this first series. It was tantalising in its premise, but so disappointing in its execution.",IMDB,"Great, then disappointing, then very disappointing.",6.0
"A series with lots of strengths a solid performances. Sticks reasonably close to the source material, not too significantly dumbed diwn. It is however utterly let down by some simply shocking casting choices. Most damagingly, Eiza González does not appear in a scene without acting as tho in a photoshoot for a fashion magazine cover. In every shot, even ones where she is portrayed as just waking up after a night binge drinking, she has supermodel, 2 hours worth of make up. The other characters continually comment ""you are beautiful"" to her, and she strikes another pose.This shatters any willing suspicion of disbelief and spoils what otherwise would have been a decent series.Watch the Chinese version instead. Sorry.",IMDB,Spoiled by Hollywood style casting,8.0
"The 3 body problem is an absolutely engrossing genre mystery with compelling characters, human drama and even a few laughs.I binged this entire first season and I can't wait for the next. The premise does stretch the plausibility of the physics, but does not eliminate any suspension of disbelief. The execution of this show is top notch, the production, writing and the acting.There are themes here that not everyone will agree with, a certain misanthropy underlying the show, but you can easily enjoy the show without feeling like these ideas are being shoved down your throat like many shows these days do.If you are fan of genre fiction, and you haven't watched this already, you are missing out!",IMDB,Do it,6.0
"After watching all episodes of the first season all hope that some have voiced after being disappointed with the first one or two episodes are misplaced: the sequences with the young Ye Wenjie are actually one of the best parts of the series: the dark atmosphere and the intensity of the acting of Zine Tseng were a perfect fit. The contemporary crime story around the string of suicides of high profile scientists was a good continuation, not the least because it was carried by two good actors, Liam Cunningham and Benedict Wong. Wong got some more depth and complexity, because he is shown in his interactions with his son, but at the same time these parts don't seem to contribute anything to the main story. Cunningham has to play an important, but very one-dimensional character. But the whole subplot is soon finished and for the viewer the small amount of suspense contained here, is killed by showing us the solution early on. The characters are later reused in a very unconvincing and silly way, basically it seems England has only one leader figure and one police man.The contemporary story line around the group of young geniuses in England which takes up most of the screen time dropped the ball on many levels. The actors are quite uneven in their performance, but even more striking is that some of them are a good fit for their role, while others are painfully unconvincing casting decisions. Eiza González as Auggie Salazar is supposed to be a technical genius, a nerd, but she completely fails to project any cool intelligence. So in those scenes where she has to show emotions or where she is just part of a group of (totally not nerdy) friends, she is convincing, but really fails in making us believe she is an academic and scientists (her impressive beauty is probably more of an obstacle than a plus in this context). Jess Hong as Jin Cheng is much better in doing exactly that. She handles the different aspects of her character and the development of the character very well. Again, the writers are quite clumsy: Though we follow Cheng all the time with her friends, where she is a very normal, emotional and non-academic person, they add a scene with her fiance Raj and his family, where she is suddenly nerdy and socially awkward.Her love story with Alex Sharp as Will Downing is well done from both sides, and Sharp plays the melancholy, self-depracating dying man quite well too. Jovan Adepo as Saul Durand is rather pale and unmemorable. This is not helped by the fact that he is supposed to be especially intelligent, but is quite often rather slow in the uptake.The writing is painfully mediocre. The story centers on some great ideas, but the writers didn't trust the audience to find them interesting enough to tag along, so they filled the screen time up with uninteresting love stories and a lot of moral discussions which don't lead to anything but some self-righteous noise. They don't care about the main plot points at all, probably because they were a given: Why is the distortion of research in physics such a problem? What are the results of the public knowledge of the existence of aliens and of their coming?As we all know, the series is based on one of the best Science Fiction publications of the 21st Century. The novels tell a very wide-ranging story in a scientifically sound manner and always amaze the reader by taking a very broad view. Scientific considerations play just as much a role as sociological ones. All of this is mind-expanding in the best sense of the word. So much intellectuality is of course unacceptable for a television series. But the fact that the authors of the series then cut out so much that the most important plot points are almost incomprehensible, but instead a sweet mash of romance and morality is stirred in, is unnecessary and cannot be excused by the requirements of a television series.All in all this series tells a story, mainly about a group of very beautiful young people and how complicated their love life is. There are also some aliens in it and some incomprehensible stuff about physics, but it is not a lot, so don't worry.",IMDB,Superficial popcorn SF,8.0
"It's remarkable how an entertaining yet complex show as 3 body problem can be ruined by one single character. The Mexican actress, Eiza Gonzalez, plays another one of the physicists in the sho...she is beautiful and brilliant, but never sees the big picture on how to save humanity, causing a great deal of frustration while viewing. To make matters worse, the actress, for lack of a better term, should stick to modeling bikinis rather than playing such roles that are way above her pay grade. Go back to school, take some acting lessons and try again Miss Gonzalez. On the other hand, Liam Cunningham is brilliant leaving me yearning more and more of GOT's Davos.",IMDB,Auggie Problem..,7.0
"Spoilers ahead!I don't know about you, but I like it when a series makes sense.And here's the thing, up until ep4 I think, right before the Villain's Macguffins start being explained, the series was pretty good. Solid entertainment. Really. But then the device by which the Aliens have been proving humanity are revealed and explained, the series just couldn't hold its good senses.We're talking about 2 super Ai computers that can fold to the size of a proton, and unfolded for just one of them to cover the entire planet. They can meddle with people's maind and make them see things. They can interrupt any electronic circuit, including autonomous cars, toasters, plain, watch, cellphone. You name it. They can make us see and hear whatever they want (they also made their earthling followers build a virtual reality set that hacks directly into the brain), but for some mysterious reason, they can't know what we're thinking.And so, the plot is as follows: These aliens will be arriving in 400 years, and so their plan is to mess with all of our scientific experiments so we don't get that advanced so that when they come, they will just conquer us easy peasy. We, brave humans, finally find out about their masterfull plan, get into action, dismantle the human network they've formed over the past 30 years here on earth... and so, they reveal themselves by making appear humongous creepy eyes in the sky.But we're fighters! And so we fight. We figure a way of kind of kick some dirt into the aliens plans by building a base on the moon. We organize and all. We're awesome. But here's the thing, with such powerful aliens devices here on earth at the aliens disposal, they could easily, waaaay easily plunder us into the most deep of the dark ages until they arrive. Before we knew abouot them, it made sense for them to walk in the shadows, now that the jig is up, it makes no sense to hold back. Just fry all of our electronics. Fry every promising human's brain. Make us see and hear things until we lose our minds, and then after 400 years, when you finally arrive at earth, you'll encounter no resistance. The endAnd that's the problem with creating such a powerful Macguffin. You can't write your way out of it.

The feeling of threat, dread, inevitability, absurdity, religious zeal and spiritual inspiration, doom, yet also struggle, hope, cleverness, sacrifice, the loss of innocence, moral dilemmas - all of those are real in this show.There's barely anything to dislike in this show - it never feels oddly paced and is always fascinating to deep dive into the minds of the actors in this clever written and fascinating scenario.Yes, you can ask yourself a lot of questions or point out how some things might be inconceivable or even stupid, however - it is never on the level of more recent offerings on the altar of entertainment, such as basically ALL OF STAR WARS since Kennedy with the exception of Andor.This show is a must and I hope it receives many more seasons.",IMDB,Simply fantastic,9.0

"First up, I did enjoy 3 Body Problem and recommend it.But there's one glaringly obvious issue that I can't seem to find an answer to or comment on: the Staircase.The whole idea of the Staircase is to get the probe to 1% light speed, travelling through space faster than we can otherwise make it by using nuclear bombs along the way.This makes perfect sense if the nuclear bombs were already in space, but they're not. So they have to be got there first, which is going to take as long as it would the issue they're trying to overcome, negating the entire project.Or are the nukes close enough to earth to negate this?Am I missing something here?

"Trying to avoid spoilers, the basic idea(s) are very good. Other substories around the basic story (historic but as well as personal moments) are also very good and touching. The slow, eerie atmosphere adds also to the experience. But... I think it lacked that little extra care and touch while its pace (slow) felt forced to create another 2-3 seasons.My view on the episodes:
1st: very good, hooked me to the series
2nd: good helped progress the story, too much emphasis on the game
3rd: very good, further improves, but too much of the game
4rth: good but could be better
5th: Well, it was very good, but I think that the reason it has the best rating is that it has some good visual FX
6-8: they are all good, but the problem is the blend. While I value very much the human moments and perspective, I think that they lose much time on them, they could consume half the time of them without loss of character depth and use it to progress the story or have something more interesting to fill the time.Generally I felt that it could be something brilliant.but in the way it lost its potential because I felt they stretched all scenes to make additional episodes.",IMDB,"BRILLIANT!

"I picked ""3-Body Problem"" off Netflix thinking it was some British murder mystery for I don't know why reasons, I just didn't watch a trailer and went in blind with no expectations-big mistake, but the best one I could've made. Straight up, I'm giving this show a 9 out of 10. Why? Because it absolutely blew my mind, that's why. Only been out a few weeks and it's already one of the best series I've seen in a long time.I don't know how after rewatching it, but it exploded my smooth brain when the reveal about the aliens happened. Yeah, not the typical scientific mishap or some international espionage-I was thinking maybe Russians screwing with tech or something. But nope, it's aliens messing with everything, and that hits you halfway through. After that reveal, the show just spirals into chaos. Bruh.What really got me was how they handled the past scenes set in China. It's super engaging, adding a solid backstory that enriches everything. Plus, the characters are killer, I feel like they were all cast perfectly. They've got this multicultural diversity that actually makes sense and is not just shoved in your face as a political statement. There's this new actress from New Zealand, barely any info on her IMDB page, and she just nails it, chur.

"Though the original book is a masterpiece of complex and engaging sci-fi, the show doesn't quite hit the mark. It feels a bit watered down and simplistic. So far, it struggles to create an immersive world, glossing over the rich details that make the story stand out. It also tends to oversimplify dialogues and character actions, which takes away from the joy of piecing together the plot on your own. Instead, it frustratingly obfuscates key elements to artificially pique interest. The characters lack depth, and neither the cinematography nor the sets are particularly remarkable. The first season rushes through its narrative, setting high expectations for future seasons without delivering much substance itself. I might revisit my review if upcoming seasons show significant improvements in budget and script quality. For now, it feels like an intriguing but underwhelming pilot that leans heavily on the potential of its future installments.",IMDB,Relying too much on the promise of grand future seasons,8.0
"So thought-provoking. This was very good, but it's a perfect example of something that should have drawn more from the original script. Too many significant changes, in my opinion. And, the game should have appeared more as a game. The characters being exactly themselves, just in different clothes, didn't really convey the understanding of what it was like in there. And they didn't spend nearly enough time in the game or with the countdown or with Ye Wenjie's background, or pretty much anything. They would have done better with 10 or 12 episodes and let us more enjoy and savor each stage. The original Three-Body is long (30 episodes) and in Chinese, but this version is missing so much detail I now realize was important to the overall story. Watch this and enjoy it, but try to find the time to watch the original.",IMDB,3 Body Problem v. Three-Body,7.0
"""3 Body Problem"" held my attention longer than most T. V. series. It's a mysterious sci-fi with enough moving parts to keep you guessing, but not so many as to keep you totally confused. Some of the world's smartest scientists were killing themselves and no one knew why. The most significant information we had as viewers was a terrestrial satellite in China that was being run by a physicist named Ye Wenjie (Rosalind Chao) roughly fifty years ago, and separately, a super-advanced VR headset being used by a physicist named Jin Cheng (Jess Hong) and a rich guy named Jack Rooney (John Bradley) in the present day. It was all mysterious, awesome, and unnerving. Some very unexplainable events were happening that had even the most preeminent minds baffled.I thought ""3 Body Problem"" was great as long as they didn't go too deep into the interpersonal relationships. That kills shows for me unless that's what the shows purport to be from the beginning. If I'm watching a sci-fi, I want sci-fi; if I'm watching an action film, I want action, etc. I want the interpersonal drama to be as limited as possible. Give me what I need in order to know the personality of each character then pivot off of it into the matter at hand. I think shows that spend too much time on personal drama and relationship drama are wasting valuable time. I feel like they do that to fill space which is a sure fire way to make me checkout.""3 Body Problem"" largely stayed away from the interpersonal drama until episodes seven and eight. It was as if they ran out of steam a bit and needed content. I don't know where ""3 Body Problem"" goes after season one, but I think they have enough momentum to go far so long as they don't get in their own way.Netflix.",IMDB,It Has Momentum,7.0
"This was a pleasant surprise! I really liked this adaptation, which I watched over the weekend. Much better than most science fiction series. The visuals are captivating and the characters are convincingly portrayed with deep emotions. Yes, the movie diverges from the book. The book was written from a Chinese point of view, and most of this series takes place in England, with different characters. But that doesn't affect the story at all.The nice thing about Cixin Liu, the book's author, is his exploration of ideas about our future and possible encounters with alien life, that has a level of technology far exceeding ours. His work shows he's a great admirer of the grandmaster of SF, Isaac Asimov, and he gives us completely new visions about scientific theories and technology we can hardly imagine. That is the essence of good science fiction.I can recommend this series to anyone, the sf-lovers as well as anyone else. See how contact is made with an alien civilization on a planet lightyears away, and see our society reacting when the aliens are setting out to invade earth in 400 years.Given the quality of these episodes, I cannot wait for the other two books to be adapted to the screen. There are some crazy new ideas about dark forest theories and the end of stars and civilisations.",IMDB,A series that surpasses many science fiction movies.,9.0
"The premise here is the premise we have in most of the productions we see these days it is to do with fear and how much we should fear and how much we should be paranoid about invaders plagues attacks of any sort keep the population in a state of constant adrenalizationOf course this kind of desire to make us fear in this case as in many others is based on a premise that is moronic at a deep level. A civilisation four light-years away which could get to us would probably have no interest whatsoever in our wretched little planet full of poverty hunger war inequality they will deem us a dimwitted planet one should stay away fromIf they have the kind of technology shown here in the Sophon They really would not be interested and as the elderly Chinese lady posited quite rightly the only guys who might want to come here would come here to help this extremely retarded people known as humans but even that is doubtful so to me the premise is silly profoundly sillyAs regards the story here it is really well put together every episode really flows well no dead time never boring And we are very much entertained by this motley Crew of actorsA Chinese girl from New Zealand who has this most interesting accent a mixture of Antipodean English and quite a few Chinese tones in there she probably moved to New Zealand when already over the age of 10 would be my guess; then we have the impossibly beautiful Mexican actress who sounds 100% American as she went to bilingual school; and for me the most interesting face the Chinaman actor from Salford in the North of England you could not get more English sounding than him but then you look at his face and you could not look more Chinese than he does; fantastic combination and a really good actor. Then we have the Irishman the elderly Irishman who feels you should ""save the planet""; from invaders; although he goes about it with the subtlety of a bull in a China shop.There is plenty of humour in this piece which is interesting to see who the producers are many famous names obviously put money upfront thinking this would do well and it has done very very well.It is way better than the vast majority of current productions and I too would highly recommend it although as I said at the top the story is based on a false premise but hey we are in the realm of fiction here it does not really matter; it is entertainment; and do not fear they are NEVER coming...",IMDB,inaccurate premise?,8.0
"This show goes seriously downhill after they all stop playing the weird video game, and worst of all, they kill off the best character halfway through the series.Benedict Wong is incredible in it and the first few episodes are brilliant and seriously compelling, but it all goes very wrong around the episode 5 mark. Somehow the threat of alien invasion sends the show into the territory of tedium. I agree with others about the serious miscasting of many of the scientist characters- the Auggie and Saul characters in particular don't seem to quite have the gravitas to pull it off, and as the show rests quite heavily on their shoulders, their miscasting really is quite a drawback.",IMDB,Patchy,7.0
"I enjoyed my time with the series. It's not as complex as the books (and the science is very shallow in comparison) but it's not nearly as bad as some have made it out to be.Bernard Wong is a great Da Shi, Liam Cunningham inhabits Wade well, and, knowing where their story goes, I did enjoy the relationship between Jin and Will. The other characters are all fair enough versions or amalgamations of various ones in the books, but I have to admit that I simply didn't like the Auggie character at all - her constant moping and nae-saying brought little to the table and I ended up just finding her annoying.I'll stick with the series (if Netflix does!), and look forward to seeing how they handle the vast change in scope as the story progresses.Overall things are off to a good start - it could go either way, but it's a long way from the 1/10 that some of the more reactionary reviewers have judged it!",IMDB,"Not a 10, but most definitely not a 1!",8.0
"Something is just off. For the readers of the original novel, you know how carefully Cixin Liu planted every detail, slowly guided you into that plot trap, and boom, a crazy idea with a magnificent scene showed up and blew you away. That is not something to be found here in this show, it's all because of the pacing, everything is raging forward, and the big ideas just flows out like the rest of the story, nothing special, nothing epic. I cannot speak for those who have never read the book before, but I doubt people can really catch the essence of those big ideas. It has nothing to do with casting, recreating or anything, I'm not criticizing those.And if you find the characters in the original book are flat enough, somehow David & Dan find a way to make characters in this show even more flat, more flat than those dehydrated Trisolarans. By the way they call them Santi now which is probably the only thing loyal to the original novel. That is the price of building 5 (or 4, or more than 5, who cares) protagonists at the same time in a show less than 9 hours. The good thing is the way they rearranged the story line did left plenty of space for the protagonists to grow in future seasons. Let's just hope the crew use this to their advantage in the next few seasons.Everything else is just a typical Netflix show, industry standard production, industry standard cinema, industry standard everything. For that it deserves a solid 7/10. It's a good show, and if you are not familiar with the original you might find some parts quite intriguing, first few episodes might be bit slow if you don't have any idea where the plot is heading but get better after ep3. It is what it is, it's a TV show detouring from the book and ,at least the first season, isn't your typical epic Sci-fi. It tries to please everyone but hardly satisfies anyone.

However, when things start to make sense and It leaves you nothing to imagine it is weird, I dont know, what I love the most of a fiction sometimes is how nothing is clear, here they tell you everything, literally.Secondly, I think there were a lot of protagonists, they werent so bad, but too many stories that didnt have much to do with the plot (stop making fat people the funny ones)All in all, it was fun, it starts very good, then its not so good, then again good and then desapointing.

"Standard Netflix series journey here - starts super intriguing and cool and then turns into complete drivel. The film has an interesting and intruigung concept, but its execution feels off and all over the place. So many ""filller"" scenes with no substance or direction, with characters just making small talk instead of moving the story forwards. There were some very good parts, such as the nano fibres tearing the boat apart, but even with this I was questioning why the scientist and the agency would do something that horrific??? Why not just board the boat and try to stop them by force? Or at least try to?? Didn't think the music was that great either. So my end take is that it could have been a great series if the script was better and the director had a clearer vision. I wouldn't waste your time on this, unless you're curious as to how bad Netflix series can be. Would be stunned if this got a second season.

I found the inaugural eight episodes of the series to be compelling viewing, with competent cast playing interesting (if not overly complex) characters, excellent special effects, and an intriguing story-line (note: I have yet to read the book(s) or watched the Chinese version of the story*).

Both young and old roles are way worse than the Tencent versions, and they made her like a hateful woman and a true villain. How can this Ye survive in CR with her hatred? And let her sleep with Bai and Evans? This is deeply wrong and an awful adaption, but I guess this is the limit of Netflix...This flat and shallow version loses the depth in Ye, who is disappointed on human but also hold hopes for the human being. This role is core of three-body problem, if you ruin her, you ruin the whole thing.Also, the first book is supposed to be a sci fi thriller, and Netflix makes it a high-school soap opera in a super mediocre way...yes, it paces faster than book and Tencent show, but it missed so so so many important explanations, plots, and metaphors to build up the tense of three-body problems. Why do many scientists kill themselves and say physics doesn't exist? Why there is no billiard explanation about what is happening? Where is the turkey scientist and 2d animal? Where are the internal conflicts within ETO???The directors suggest that the adaption of this book is difficult and they want to simplify it for the sake of audience. But I feel that they don't really get the essence of the book and have no respects for the audience and the book. They just want to make money from a drama show, so they set a book of entire human kind and the whole universe on a few folks from a class and two policeman in UK? This is a terrible product of Netflix's data-driven strategy as they just want to gain more audience with a fast-pacing, terribly routined and expensive show from hundreds of other shows and short videos on the market. I don't believe there will be many book fans being satisfied with this show, and the new readers of books will hate this version later.

"The writers, directors, and all the crew, frankly, created an outstanding work in everything, the story, the characters, and the changing events between the past and the present, and we do not forget the actors who actually gave a distinguished and strong performance, but the problem is that it is possible to predict what will happen later, even if the series extends for a number of more seasons. We will see what we expect to happen at a rate of 75%. Why is it because the series is so close to Dark that the viewer may say that he revived Dark for greatness, and this, in my opinion, will attract a larger audience, but as I said, if he watches Dark, you can guess what will happen later in the three body problem.",IMDB,Dark series between the story and rising again,9.0
"As one reviewer put it well - ""Good but not great""
I'm sure the book series is amazing, I never read it so I am basing the show solely on the viewpoint of someone coming at it from never reading the books.Some areas feel rushed, as if they needed to push some narratives to get things moving. Not sure why because this type of show I think needed to be developed.I absolutely can't stand Auggie's character. Her character is the epitome of today's generation. Selfish, instant gratification, doesn't care about the future, not forward thinking at all, doesn't care about the big picture, etc. She literally brings the quality of the show down.Some things don't make sense though. If the Sophon's are so omnipresent I don't understand how humanity is allowed to do things. But, it's something I can look aside at for the show's sake.One thing I will say after watching season one - If by the end of season 2 it's shown humanity keeps losing the small ""battles"" I won't watch anymore. I'm sick of watching shows where the bad guys are always winning. That seems to be the trend these days. Sorry, I see enough bad stuff in reality. I turn to shows for non-reality, fantasy, good stuff feelings.",IMDB,"Decent show, but not amazing",7.0
The top scientists are a bunch of whiny overly emotional individuals who regularly get drunk or stoned like college kids. This is so unbelievable I could not take this story seriously. They also look like they strolled out right off the modeling walkway. Who thought this kind of casting and melodrama would aid a sci-fi series? And is the new thing for females to regularly threaten male characters with violence and this is supposed to be normal? I was floored when the most emotional scientist would rather let the world be conquered so she could go do humanitarian work in Mexico. The whole premise is a joke.,IMDB,Unbelievable mess of a story,2.0
"I watched both versions of the series. Netflix did it much better! Much better acting and production... As for the Chinese version, the acting is very poor, the dialogues as well, the insertion of some pointlessly bad special effects made it even worse, halfway through the series I wanted to give up watching... Although, I think that the big problem of Chinese cinematography is censorship, my assumption is that the director and the actresses are not able to express their full potential because the problem is with the strong restrictions imposed by the state, it is simply a tragedy, both for art and for people in general. The paradox is that the Chinese actresses acted better in the British version than in the Chinese version...",IMDB,Great! Much better than the Chinese version!,9.0
"First off, this is a really good piece of TV Sci-Fi. I've read the trilogy, including the first book twice, and I was very satisfied with what they did. Frankly, given the scope of the first book, I'm surprised they were willing to take it on. I agree with the guys who said some of the character changes were detriments, but I just think they did the best they could when you have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars.I'm frantic to encourage people to see the show because, like many of the other people who've read the trilogy, as good as the first book is, the second is even better, maybe even way better. I've been reading sci-fi my whole life and the second book is the only sci-fi book I've ever read that made me change my view on a major topic (and, no, I'm not going to tell you what it is). And the special effects in the second book are even crazier than the first. So, please, please, please, watch the show and get the second season made.I genuinely think many, if not most, of the reviews at 5 or below are paid for by the Chinese government. There's just no way you can give this show only four stars. As you know, there is a 30-part Chinese version and people are running this down to get eyeballs on the Chinese version. I haven't seen it, suspect it is definitely ok, but can't imagine they equal the special effects in the Netflix version.So, see this and have your friends see it so we can see the second season!",IMDB,some of the low reviews are bogus,8.0
"I haven't read the book, so I'm reviewing this series from a more objective point of view.Production quality is great, special effects are OK.However, acting is mediocre at best and cringe-worthy most of the time. And where did you get that Latino chic who looks like she just got off the Versace's ramp? Silicone lips, fake eye-lashes... and you're telling us she is some kind of Oxford genius? Oh, come on... Have you ever been to Oxford/Cambridge, have you actually seen what kind of people are best scientists, what they look like, how they behave, what they do in free time? I thought so...
The Chinese Cultural Revolution part is great: the setting, the story are very touching and the Asian actors are first-class. Ye's story is really interesting. However, the London drama is so boring and the actors can't act a bit... You actually have to pull through 3-4 episodes for the story to take off.There are 3 books, so I guess there will be at least 2 more seasons... please hire better actors and don't ruin it further.",IMDB,An interesting story ruined by mediocre actors,6.0

"So I've managed to watch almost 2 episodes of this before giving up. If this was an original show, I may have given it the benefit of a doubt, but the creators here have taken on one of the best Sci Fi novels ever written and handled it with the reverse Midas touch, hiring an untalented cast and writing in a bunch of utterly unbelievable characters. Seriously it was easier to believe in the supernatural events depicted than that moronic characters like Auggie or John could pass as groundbreaking scientists. Everything in the book was changed into a stupider version of events. Beautifully written storylines were rushed or discarded altogether, and yet production found the time to graciously spice things up with some unnecessary nudity. It's sad to see what Netflix seems to think of its brainless mass audience. Sad enough for me to cancel my subscription for good.I can only hope that one day another network might pick this trilogy up and treat it with the respect it deserves.Giving this more than 1 star for the visual effects and the China storyline.",IMDB,Dumbed down beyond recognition,6.0
"Rather mediocre series. The original story does 95% of the job, keeps you intrested if you like scifi. Sadly there are some bad actors that spoil the series. Eliza Gonzales is just really very bad. Here character is annoying with doesn't do her any favors, but whoever cast her should loose their job.Otherewise you will probaby notice all the added dialogs that doesn't bring anything and is just a filler, all the added plots revolving around the added main characters. This is just a sign that whoever planned this series wasn't aiming high. Seems like it was rather a tedious job, with is a pity because the potential was high.Still it was enjoyable to watch.",IMDB,"Not bad, the plot carries it, rest is mediocre",9.0
"Most 1-4 star reviews are the book warriors. They claim that's its poorly adapted etc. I mean, it is not a classic, so who cares? The story is very entertaining. So I personally clearly recommend not to listen to these reviews. Since it is actually a really good series. Building up nice excitement and holding it till the end. Not a fan of each character to be honest. But even some annoying folks cannot harm the spirit of this series. And it is not a happy Disney story, oh no, don't worry. Some moments are truly shocking. And not so far away as other science fiction. Leaving you back with real awkwardness and what if moments.Enjoyed every minute of the show.",IMDB,Underrated,8.0
"I enjoyed this overall, liked the cast, the acting, visuals abit questionable sometimes (blob covering the earth) but generally pretty good. It's just the story I found it hard to take seriously, both the ai's strategy and the humans strategy make zero sense. Ai coming to attack us gave us a 400 year warning, told us all their plans and attempts to wipe out science otherwise we win? Why not just stop the ships?The humans strategy is even more insane. To send basically a living human brain with no body that gets propelled through space by 1,000 nuclear bombs that each have extreme room for failure as it all needs to be lined up like threading a needle? How is that a viable option? How are effectively 2 people on the planet coming up with this mental strategy, is there nobody else? We can propel a probe at 1% the speed of light, technically right now in real life, its called project starshot and it shoots lasers at a 1 gram craft propelling it to insane speeds. But the idea of riding a brain on the waves of 1000 nuclear bombs is the one that wins?Not only that, but the 2 people in charge of this absolute mess are about to time travel (cryo) to the future to make sure this insane plan works. That's the best earth could come up with? I'm ashamed and we deserve to be wiped out. Why not send probes travelling at 1% lightspeed as kinetic nukes at the fleet or basically anything other than the current plan.",IMDB,A fun watch but prepare to detach from reality,6.0
"The only issue I have with ""3 Body Problem"" is that now I have a ""no body problem"". This show is absolutely amazing from beginning to end. Despite what some people are saying about having too many protagonists, I feel that only adds to the depth of the show. This a show about humanity afterall, and last time I checked, humanity comprised of more than 1 individual. Weiss, Benioff, Woo and company work their magic and make us fall in love with the protagonists and every one of the actors absolutely kills it.

"Most of the characters in this series are insufferable. They are arrogant, spoiled, obnoxious brats. Both the old and the young. Their dialogue swings between sappy and on the nose by the sentence. But, there's good news. I found that I could fast forward through most of the interpersonal 'filler' and suffer no loss of story progress.This is one of those shows that thinks it's smarter than it is. A good example is the shows idea of 'innovation.' The propulsion system proposed in the show is seen by other researchers as 'ground-breaking.' But, in truth, this technique has been used in a number of sci-fi properties for years, and even presented visually on screen.At one point one of the characters mentioned that they're going to go watch Rick and Morty. And the Rick and Morty reference made me laugh at the program, since this show seems well aligned for that crowd. It's not 'actually' smart, but plays like it is. That is this series in a nutshell.It's probably enough material for a movie, but stretched to 8 hours, it quickly becomes laborious to watch.I'd describe the series as ""ok."" I don't understand the hype behind it. Actual science is very difficult to understand at times. But, at no time was this hard to follow in the least. Dumbed down? Yes. Just dumb? Maybe.",IMDB,If you can stomach the characters...it's ok...,6.0
"The acting and writing in this series is baffling.All the younger actors simply can't act. Apart from the Chinese woman (young and older versions), everybody else has no depth whatsoever.The writing is another problem in itself. Who the hell kisses their friends on the forehead to say goodbye? The writing is crazy awful and horrible lines/actions are flying around 90% of the time. They tried to bring drama.. They brought cringe.The ""science"" behind it all is also baffling. A simple distance calculation is made to be the most brilliant thing ever. It's pretty grim how this was dumbed down to an extreme. The ""intelligent"" characters are not impressive or believable.There's no emotion and no science, so really, what's in it? I don't really understand who they made this for. It's not for kids, but it's too ~low IQ~ for adults. Maybe teenagers? The ideas behind it all are great (have just bought the book because of it), but the series was extremely poorly executed.Mediocre at best.",IMDB,How low your IQ has to be to think any of those scientists are smart?,1.0
"After successfully adapting the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" book series, which was long considered unfilmable literature, into one of the most iconic and successful television series of all time (""Game of Thrones""), David Benioff and D. B. Weiss sought their next challenge. At the perfect timing, the challenge presented itself in the form of an offer to adapt the ""Remembrance of Earth's Past"" book trilogy into a television series.Already in the early episodes you can tell this is one of the most ambitious Science-Fiction stories yet to be produced on television, and I can definitely see what all the early hype was about. The source material for itself is said to be fascinating but simultaneously very challenging to adapt to the visual medium, with some elements (also in the first book/season but mostly in the latter ones) that are hyped to be almost impossible to put to screen. Netflix put a huge amount of money on this franchise during a bidding war years ago, and once Benioff & Weiss signed their overall deal with them it was a perfect opportunity to try and build a household-name Sci-Fi franchise for Netflix with this show- and I surely hope it will ultimately receive the success it deserves.Following the commercial success of ""Game of Thrones"" and its numerous awards and unprecedented viewership numbers, Benioff & Weiss became the hottest names in the television industry by the end of 2019, and all major production companies competed on having them produce their next series among their studios, with astronomical budgets. Expectations for the duo were higher than usual - to deliver a product on par with ""Game of Thrones"" and also to redeem their reputation after mixed reviews of its conclusion, which were accompanied by harsh criticisms and disproportionate ""wishes"" from a vocal minority of the audience.For this purpose, they teamed up with Alexander Woo (""True Blood""), and together they decided to adapt the trilogy by Cixin Liu into a series - a daring trilogy that received numerous awards and accolades, including from George R. R. Martin (the author behind ""Game of Thrones"") and former US President Barack Obama.Similarly to ""Game of Thrones"", the story told in the trilogy is undoubtedly a slow-burner, gradually unfolding over time and requiring patience and investment from the viewer over several episodes to fully appreciate. Already in the first season, the storyline appears to shift multiple times throughout the season, as the overarching narrative the series is aimed at becomes clearer from episode to episode. The season finale was labeled by some viewers as ""anti-climactic,"" but most readers of the books agree that the first book is the weakest of the trilogy and merely sets the stage for ambitious developments in future seasons, with the manner of visual execution of which remains a mystery. Nevertheless, it is important to note that even as a self-contained season, this is television at a very high level, offering one of the most unique and enjoyable viewing experiences in recent years. The series never bores, and it even provides some of the greatest television moments of recent years.For understandable reasons, the most talked-about episode from the first season is the fifth episode, while my personal favorite is actually the seventh episode, which focuses on character dynamics, positioning pieces for the big conflict, and strengthening its narrative through writing.The series contains a plethora of concepts from the worlds of theoretical physics and Science-Fiction that may not be easily digestible and may potentially alienate those less inclined towards the genre - something that, in my opinion, might benefit the series if viewers watch it at a suitable pace rather than binge-watching everything at once. Considering that the series is not as universally popular to a degree that spoilers flying around the internet, and since everyone can essentially watch it at their own pace, I would highly recommend the series even to people for whom Sci-Fi isn't their number one genre- as it requires investment but also offers much more than regular Sci-Fi entertainment, presenting a non-conventional spin on the genre. As a man of science myself and as a fan of the Sci-Fi genre I'm really connecting to the premise of the show, to the setting, to the characters and to the respect the writing has to the scientific concepts the show is based upon. This show truly ignites my intellectual and academic passions in all the positive ways. The plot and the writing are blending into this complex setting perfectly in a way that got me completely hooked and wanting for more.The production values are extremely off the charts and I really hope this will be a major player in Below-the-Line categories at the Emmy's next year. I would even root for it in several Above-the-Line categories at the awards, since as I implied this series is crafted to perfection in almost all aspects. I was thrilled to find out Benioff and Weiss re-teamed with the legendary composer Ramin Djawadi in this series. Known for iconic scores such as ""Game of Thrones"", ""Westworld"" and ""House of the Dragon"", Djawadi provides a magnificent score that truly elevated the series to another level just as you would expect. Besides practically telling an entire story within the show, the score is a delight to listen to outside of watching the show, combining several different musical styles. Knowing how Djawadi operates it's safe to believe the score is building up to be gradually better and better and more complex as the show moves further towards the climax. While the visual effects could use some improvement, the other technical aspects are also of a very high standard and justify the enormous budget invested in the series. The writing, as expected, is top-notch and treats the source material with great respect and maturity, while the direction is also excellent and perfectly meets the demands set by the script. The story and overall framing and world-building are overwhelmingly ambitious and are executed in a brilliant way that makes it one of the most unique and thrilling television experiences iv'e had in a long time.I'm glad to have a new TV series to be heavily invested in, and will surely look forward anxiously for the future seasons, that as described by the writers (and also by readers of the book trilogy) will be even better and more ambitious. I really enjoyed every single episode and while I think its a must watch for fans of the genre, I also think the story and execution are good enough so that even people who are not huge followers of the Sci-Fi genre should give it a try. Kind of like with GoT back in the day.Kudos to Netflix for this brilliant series which is one of the best things I've seen in a long time. Bring on season 2!",IMDB,Sensational,10.0
This adaptation from the (wonderful) novel is pretty extensive but it is still faithful to the central ideas and themes of the original. What we get are great sympathetic characters genuinely original plot and a side order of physics and cosmology. I cannot recommend too highly - and I have just watched it a second time.

"3 Body Problem is definitely above the typical gruel streaming platforms feed us, but as it's often with great sci-fi ideas, it starts falling off as episodes start exposing the main mystery.There's two parts to this show, the great mystery, and the interpersonal drama. Now, the mystery is pretty great to about halfway to the season. When it's finally exposed, you'll be ""eh, that's it?"" and while it's still fun to watch, it's not all that much of a promise. Also, half of the initial mysteries get dumped and forgotten at rapid pace, ""Lost""-style.Then there's characters. Oh boy. Chinese woman who is secretly loved by English dude is in relationship with a Pakistani, while hanging out with a Mexican girl, a Nigerian guy and Samwell Tarly.So... uh... meet the Planeteers! Captain Planet himself is played by an actor with origins from Hong Kong or the one with Irish descent, take your pick, and chased by mysterious Australian woman, while the main villain, so far, is a supercomputer in the form of a Japanese girl... All of it happens mostly in UK, by the way.Yeah, it looks as ridiculous as it sounds. People at Netflix and the production companies have sure lost any resemblance of sanity. Their drama doesn't work very much, anyway, but luckily, only half of the show is about that.I would watch a second season, just to see what comes next, but only because there's nothing else to watch those days, anyway.",IMDB,Average sci-fi adventure,7.0
"3 body Problem is an interesting series.It does so many things right but a few clunky sc
enes here and there.I have not read the books but I do see a very anti government / revolution tone to the first part, which Infeel does come across a little overtly blunt to the ideas of westernism.Other then that the highly suspenseful murder mystery along with emotional relationships make the series an interesting combination.Other reviews and comments keep suggesting that the characters are unrealistic as if scientists are cold and logical like spock from star trek.My experience with scientists and how they are expressed in this series is pretty spot on. Mix of intelligence with emotional investment.Overall I thought it let the audience clearly understand the issues at hand, whilst giving the hopelessness of their situation.The quality of the production is good in both picture and sound.Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy political science fictions with an alien twist.",IMDB,A international adaption of an in-depth scifi,8.0
"I understand that the original story was so complicated that it was not possible to fit it all into one season series. Netflix had to make some deft adaptations to make it work, cutting some characters or amalgamating some into one. However, they felt it was important to incorporate a romantic sub-plot, which had nothing to do with the original story. This changed the genre from a hard sci-fi to a romantic, light sci-fi, coming-of-age story.The casting choices were terrible, especially for Auggie. I HATED this actress's selection so much. No offense to scientists out there, but there is no way on Earth a top scientist would look like a 23-year-old supermodel with super-long eyelashes and filled-in duck lips. If they did, then I would be worried about the research they conduct. She does not emit an aura of intelligence befitting a scientist character, making the role very hard to believe. The Chinese roles were OK, while there was something off with Jin; again, he doesn't look too smart either, but much better than Auggie. All the faces look too ""San Francisco"" to be believable, and the ""represent all ethnicities"" agenda is very strong here.The story was so rushed that the ""epic"" feeling from the book is gone. Some of the dialogues are unnecessary and make the tone of the story feel like a teenager drama.If you have never read the book, you might enjoy this adaptation. If you are a hard sci-fi lover and have read the book, you better avoid this adaptation.",IMDB,Dumbed down version for western audience,6.0

"Netflix's adaptation has turned into a quintessential American TV series. Tired of the typical ""bookish"" genre, I was initially delighted by the change, only to find it to be just another mediocre American show. In this series, the character Zhi Zi resembles a supercomputer, capable of enveloping the entire Earth. However, in reality, Zhi Zi disrupts astronomical/physical observational phenomena, instilling a deeper fear in scientists-the fear of the unknown energy rather than the fear of established scientific prowess.This portrayal not only showcases the fear of the unknown but also highlights the unsettling notion that our understanding of the universe may be fragile in the face of such disruptive forces. It challenges the very fabric of our scientific certainty, plunging characters and viewers alike into a realm of existential dread.",IMDB,TV Series About Supercomputers,7.0

Its narrative pace and plot progress are too fast, and the changes to the main characters are too large.

The cinematography, pacing, dialogue... none of these are particularly well done, some of them are absolutely atrocious, bordering on unwatchable. In fact, it has all the earmarks of every other cookie-cutter Netflix sci-fi series without any real depth added to it.If you have watched other Netflix shows and you know the most superficial ideas from 3 Body Problem you don't have to try too hard to imagine what this adaptation looks and feels like.

"For those who haven't read the books: go watch this. A lot of the amazing concepts are explored and shown beautifully on-screen. The production quality is fantastic. If you loved it, please read the books, they will allow you to explore everything in far greater detail and truly digest it.For those who have read the books: beware and have an open mind. I fully understand why they completely transplanted the setting and shuffled many of the characters, as well as the timeline. It's an ambitious effort, which I think didn't succeeded in the way they wanted. Some of the characters in the book, particularly book 2 and 3, are somewhat flat and one-dimensional. This is okay, as they really are just vessels to tell a great civilizational epic and study of the human condition. They tried to change that, making the show more character-driven. However, at the same time they rush things, leaving you little time to sit and ponder and making the character arcs even worse than they are in the books.But at the same time, the concepts are still amazingly brought. Some of the moments that you wonder how they will put them on the screen, are wonderfully executed.

"As a preface, I haven't read the books, but I have watched the full Chinese series.I was reluctant to watch this version, but am glad I did. I thought this was, overall, a pretty decent adaptation. Not perfect by any means, but then neither is the Chinese version. I think the Chinese version does a great job of explaining the science and the reasoning behind the decisions better, but it lacks any real sense of dread and the present-day characters seemed a little bland. The US version also lacks that sense of dread, and also cuts out a lot of the explanation for certain decisions, but it does (in my opinion) have more rounded present-day characters, even though they are a little bit 'cookie-cutter'. This version also cuts out a lot of the 60s/70s back story , which I thought was one of the more interesting parts of the Chinese show, and helped lend weight to the main characters motivations.This version moves at a much faster pace than the Chinese version, which in some ways is good, but I think they blew the whole plotline too early. I would like to have seen more focus on the mental trauma caused by the slow realization of what was happening. A director like M. Night Shymalan who is very skilled at building dread would have been perfect for this project. I would also have liked to see a stronger focus on international co-operation and reaction to the events. It seems the whole world is ok with the UK making all the calls.All in all it kept me hooked enough to binge watch. I look forward to the second season.",IMDB,Overall a Pretty Decent Adaptation,8.0
"I was not familiar with this going into it, so I had zero expectations.After watching all 8 episodes, I can say that I felt it was well done and extremely enjoyable.It a nice fresh breath into the world of Sci-Fi, where science and psychology co-mingle.Who are the bad guys? Do they really exist? Is it all a ""scam""? Are we playing into their hands?The ""humans being humanities best ally and worst enemy"" is quite on target as well.It is nice to have to actually think about motives, players, actions, and ""hints"" dropped along the way. Also, it's nice to think about these creatures in a non-humanoid way and really stretch the mind of what they could be. Bi-pedal humanoids is so last decade...Do the aliens exist? Can they not lie?

"I've read the book, and I have seen the Chinese version of this.The new Westernized version, except for the effects, moves way too fast, is poorly done and purposefully seems like a China-bashing effort.The story opens with an exaggerated scenario of the abuses of Mao's cultural revolution, which was very bravely and admirably in the Chinese version of this story, but here is overly graphic and dramatic, and ugly - and without context - read unfair and non informative or enlightening to us Western viewersThis production takes a globally popular Chinese SF masterpiece and transposes it to England, in modern hipster lingo, and tries to move too fast that it skids and goes off the road. The visuals are good, but the screenplay is very poorly adapted.Having just recently watched the Chinese version of this - it is so much more human, interesting and engaging - though the Chinese version is a pretty long slog - something like 30 episodes and it drags in many places and the effects are not as flashy - but I think it is much, much better done.TBP ... well, I am interested in what people who have not read the book or been primed as to the story of plot are making of this because to me, who is family with most of it - it is going much too fast to establish characters or make us interested or care about them.It also suffers from the same thing the Chinese version did - the many Chinese Asian characters faces were not chosen to be distinctive enough for Western eyes so it is a bit confusing and harder to follow, but not impossible.The scenes at the labor camp zoomed by in minutes and had none of the deep impact of personal and societal betrayal and gravitas that the Chinese version did - and I would think this had to be a big deal in China for this movie to slam Mao's cultural revolution as it did. We get a accelerated vision of this that is kind of insulting to the import to China this must have been.As China seems to open up to be more self-critical, the US is shrinking away from its history - as a general statement of my perceptions as an average older white American. It is sad to see.The criticisms I am making are systemic and are going to be throughout the series, so I felt OK to write about this in a review even though only seeing a little over two episodes.With all the effort that must have gone into this, it should have been better.",IMDB,"Not a very interesting Western adaptation, Chinese version is flawed but a better story with better characters 4/10",7.0
"The first 2-3 episodes did a great job of hooking the watcher in. Interesting concept, unknown extraterrestrials communicating with esteemed academics without sharing their reason why. I haven't read the book so cannot compare whether the stories align. I felt the writers should have included more of the science and their research in some scenes, as it was hard to believe the characters were the geniuses they were supposed to be. The last few episodes fizzled out a bit but were still worthwhile.

"Decided to watch due to the initial hype. Probably not as good as I was expecting considering all the amazing things I heard about it, and nor was I let down because the books were better ( I did not read the books). The first two episodes outside of the Maoist China scenes were pretty dry. However as the season went on I certainly started to enjoy the characters more outside of Auggie. The casting is really quite good. Benedict Wong, Liam Cunningham, and Jess Hong are all fantastic.I like how they presented the moral debates because they weren't overly preachy and somewhat indirectly implied the consequences of each decision.Overall, the show is nothing to jump up and down about but also not a waste of time. I'll be tuning in for season 2 whenever that is.",IMDB,Respectable,7.0

"Half way of the show now, and honestly i think it's not half bad. Solid sci-fi screen adaptation, good pace and okayish CGI. I don't think screen adaptions must follow the original book, however it's still no nessisary to make this much changes, and divide characters like this. And i have to say it really not nessisary to be THIS MUCH political correct. I don't mind to see diversity of characters or femal power, but it was just carried out that makes you feel too forced. Some lines are out of context and just to be there for the political correctness, that's really unnecessary.

"Why lazy writing? Because I'm only halfway through episode 2, and half the characters (the so-called ""Oxford Five"") seem to have to decorate every sentence with the f-word. I'm no prude, but this to me is just lazy writing. Yes, you could argue it's an attempt to bring some ""reality"" to the work, but this is meant to be an epic tale of hard science and cosmic survival.The British scenes, with the Oxford Five (who are all portrayed by very self-consciously ""actorly"" types), are incredibly irritating. This typical BBC Doctor Who cheap TV dialogue, acting and directing style clashes with the more cinematic Chinese scenes set during the Cultural Revolution (which they do manage to get right).And though the source material helps carry the show (please read the books if you haven't), there's very little tension or sense of wonder generated. The Chinese show, despite being slow (or perhaps because of it) managed this much better.I'll keep watching, since I was excited when I heard about this remake, but unfortunately right from the first few minutes I knew it would be a disappointment.",IMDB,Lazy writing but the source pulls it through,6.0
"The sci-fi elements are not primary, not secondary, not tertiary but quaternary to the plot.The primary element of the show is melodrama, poorly acted ESG-friendly melodrama. The vast majority of actors are rigid and diverse, except in China. In the Chinese settings they are portrayed to be Chinese and convey some emotions, but in the British settings they are portrayed to be ""diverse"" with the applicable current-day tropes.What else is there: rigid acting, long stares, nihilism and magic thinking.The story in itself makes no sense, no civilization would have flourished to reach the stage of interstellar travel on an unstable planet subject to pseudo-random cataclysms.If such a civilization could achieve interstellar travel, which requires them to travel 400 years, they should be able to seed the universe with a myriad of ships. The same myriad we were showed they would invade earth with.As for a chinese traitor being able to move freely on her own without repercussion on a top secret base in communist china and doom a whole planet on a few words... then recruiting followers to create a doomsday cult. Well, it's just fantasy.If the aliens are capable of some elements of mind control and control cameras on land but not satellites, then it makes no sense they would not have probed the minds of the population. So the reaction of the ""lord"" makes no sense.Let's also pass on the concept of the VR headset, ridiculous. There's more garbage in there like the converted tanker with an unprotected satellite dish, or the magical nanofibers that can cut anything without sustaining any damage. The scenes following the chopping of the ship are ridiculous on so many levels, better not think about it if you intend to like this type of production.This show is really tedious to watch.",IMDB,Why?,1.0
"I have seen the Chinese version. It was fine. Veeeery slow, but fine. The Netflix version is imo better. The source material is very challenging to adapt to tv, but Benioff/Wise/Woo are doing a good job.I'm on my second viewing. That's how good it is. It's not often I watch a tv show twice in a short while.I really like the characters. It's a diverse cast made for western media. Some are the same as in the Chinese version, others are an amalgam of one. And it serves the story well. They are convincingly portrayed with deep emotions. Like Auggie who actually reacts with grief, sorrow and fear when they use her lifes work to kill people.The production, the cinemathography and CGI is great. As it should be with the amount of money thrown in.Some people are really creepy in their critique. Some giving it 1 star because they obviously hate Benioff and Wise. Why?

"I'll be very brief. This show is the equivalent of cheap booze with whiskey aromaIf you're in bar drinking low quality spirits, and here comes that counterfeit drink that has some Macallan aroma you'll clearly drink that for the rest of the night.This is this show, if you're seeing the ideas for the first time, you'll be: ""yeah decent, 8/10"" because the 'cool beats' are all straight up ripped from the books.""But hey dear reviewer, this is an adaptation, what nonsense are you spilling, ofc they have books 'stuff' ""Well sure, but almost everything that should've been original about this show is of a poor quality and the book stuff is a downgrade.I'm sorry but rewatch this show and you'll quickly realise that the dialogue is unnatural, that's not how friends talk, the interpersonal relationships this show tries to build are not natural. The plot itself doesn't make sense.In the books, the 'power levels' of 'something' (to avoid spoilers) are toned down. Here they are cranked to 11 which makes the story the show tries to tell absolutely not fit with the book story, yet the show desperately has to dumb down or 'guess X forgot' to make the story fit.Why 6? Because the crew, VFX, cinematography, all the auxiliary stuff is all there. Heck, even a lot of actors are doing their job mighty fine.

"I was cautiously anticipating this show after hearing that the showrunners of game of thrones were making a Sci Fi show based off a book/series of books and I'm pleased to say I think this show is actually very good.The acting is great across the board and has a plot that gets you hooked very quickly, even with the first few episodes being slower than the later ones. Some of my favourite parts of the show take place in China in the 60s and 70s with a particular highlight being the closing montage of episode 2.There are definitely some moments of dodgy CGI however I never found it to be too distracting or a deal breaker because of how well they execute many crazy concepts on screen, especially in episode 5.The show never goes too in depth on science that would go over most people's head's which i imagine can be a good or bad thing depending on your taste and/or knowledge of the source material in which I have none.Overall I would recommend this show to fans of Sci Fi and a good mystery. This proves that the showrunners, David and Dan, are at their best figuring out adaptations as opposed to writing their own material, thankfully the source material has been completed unlike a song of ice and fire and there is also a third showrunner on board hopefully keeping things on track. Future seasons of this show are looking promising.",IMDB,Surprisingly great.,7.0
"""Fortunately, I knew nothing about the books and watched without prejudice. I enjoyed it immensely! The series is in my opnion at least an 8 and will probably eventually score even higher. To the book readers, who I think are rather disappointed, don't behave so spoiled. Enjoy the beautiful visuals and the fact that you get such stunning imagery for a few euros a month. Also, I have to laugh at the criticism that it's so unlikely for young people to have such prestigieus scientific jobs. As if what else happens in this series is so likely! Sci-fi is sci-fi, I would say. And 'young' people can achieve stunning resulta, why not?! By the way, at the age of these scientists, Mozart was almost deceased. So why couldn't it be possible? Anyway, I'm looking forward to the sequels and will definitely watch. A beautiful series and thank you for making it!""",IMDB,Thank you Netflix,9.0
"I believe most changes made from the books by Cixin Liu are good ones for an adaptation like this. I do have gripes with the show. Casting choices. Mainly Eiza Gonzalez and the other scientist. I'm sorry, but Eiza is just a very unbelievable scientist. Her acting is very one dimensional... basically one emotion, anger and disappointment. At all times. Her angular and artificially sculpted face is a huge distraction for me. It's as if they decided to just ""put a young hot chick"" as the lead. It's ridiculous.I also feel the series does not feel as EPIC as it should. While reading the books, it just felt so epic and the stakes were so incredibly high. This does not feel that way, at least not yet. I believe with a little better use of exposition in the story, this could have been achieved. The books are educational, even if not on purpose. This series focuses more on the adventurous points of this tale, which is honestly are the less interesting aspects. The themes of the original story that Cixin Liu wrote are very scientific, philosophical, and complex. The Netflix series feels a bit dumbed down for a lazier audience.Still, I do find it to be somewhat entertaining. I can't help it because it's a cool story. It does feel a bit rushed though. The first season could have used 4 more episodes and brought in some things they omitted from the book to raise the stakes and make it feel more epic.If you're loving this, I'm happy for you! It's not bad. Maybe I would more if I hadn't have read the books. I highly recommend the books if you like this series, because so far I have to say they are the superior version of the story.",IMDB,Huge fan of the books. Show is okay...,7.0
"This is a very uneven show. Some parts are thrilling and compelling... some meander and don't make sense. Some casting is spot on while some irritated me the entire time. I can't say I would be excited about a season 2. I never read the book but the show centers on 5 or 6 smart ""scientists"" dealing with the aftermath of a collapse of science. The main character Auggie -- a scientist who is supposed to be starting a nanotech company. Too bad she looks like a 23 year old supermodel who I don't buy as a scientist for a second. There is also some of the famous D&D poor writing with a dumbing down of the story as you can see they only allude to complicated subjects but never go into them. Then there is the idea that just about everything in the world just happens to happen to this 5 or 6 person friend group in London. Not buying it. There is also a plot line that goes over 6 or so of the episodes that, in the end, comes to nothing. Super uneven. There is just honestly no one to root for in this story even with actors doing their level best.",IMDB,Meh,5.0
"I watched the first episode, and it was everything I hoped for. I actually really don't know what was that you r all expecting?! You want accuracy? Why tho?We already have the books, and we also have the Tencent Chinese adaptation, which is very faithful 1:1 copying the books. So why do Netflix have to do the same thing again and again. It's just different adaptation, with international version and cast (amazing cast), and more thrilling events. So basically if u want so much accurate, just stick to the books or to the Chinese version. And for me in my POV, I want to see something new, something unique, different approach, not just copy paste like the Chinese version (I need to mention that I saw a lot of reviews on it, and ppl calling it boring/slog, and not suitable for the non readers) so that's why I don't mind changes even if it was a lot, in the end, overall, if it fails very hard, we lost nothing, we still have the other Chinese adaptation, if it succeed, its a win win for Netflix and for the creators and also for the book universe!U just need to be open minded and not judge until u actually see it !",IMDB,Be open minded!,10.0
"I've had 3 Body Problem on my reading list for about three years but have been reading other books and down prioritised it. This is no longer the case after watching this first season, that is somewhere between a 8 and a 9 for me.The back story is brilliant and very innovative, at least for me and I have read and seen my share of sci-fi. I was very disturbed by the fact that D&D were doing this but in hindsight, they did a very good job with Game of Thrones when they had source material (i.e the first 4-5 seasons) but far from good without source material. If they just keep to the books and end this in 3 seasons they will be redeeming themselves a bit from the GoT (season 6-8 (especially 8))disaster.I very much look forward for reading the books this summer and the second season.",IMDB,Pleasantly surprised!,8.0
"What a blistering mistake putting that face of Gonzalez in this story. D&D had so many solid female leads to choose from in their GoT roster, they went with someone who has the acting range of Kristen Stewart because... what? They needed a pouty mouth? Is she schtupping a producer to get this role? They need to off this character ASAP to salvage this series. It's the only, and sadly major, distractor of the series. Otherwise their adaptation of the book is brilliant, although a deviation from the books they are more faithful to the Cultural Revolution drivers of the plot. Kudos for that. Special effects are solid.... it is interesting comparing this to the more faithful Tencent version from China...

There is a noticable lack of those themes in the past few years and I am not sure why. Maybe CGI is too expensive?When it comes to 3 Body Problem series, the acting is good, the plot is original and the camera work is professional. 6th and 7th episode of the 1st season feel like fillers though. Even though a director or writer probably wanted them for character building, interpersonal relationships and for us to start caring more about certain characters, they could have been much shorter.

I wonder how she got the role?!Some of the CGI are quite good, while some look a bit sloppy.I also think this is a pretty good adaptation considering all the elements and complicated structures in the novels.Give it a go if you like sci-fi, but I would suggest you either mute or fast forward all the scenes with Auggie.",IMDB,The female lead ruined half of the show,7.0
"As a Chinese audience who has read the novel ""Three Body Problem"" more than three times during high school, I must applaud Netflix's efforts. It's not because it restores the magnificent imagination in the novel, nor because its special effects and performances are amazing, but because it uses a sufficiently simplified form to allow every ordinary foreigner who has not read the Three Body Problem novel to understand the charm of this masterpiece, even if it is only a small part.In China, criticism of Netflix's ""Three Body Problem"" series focuses on its highly simplified and adapted character relationships and images. For audiences who are familiar with the original work (such as myself), this is indeed somewhat difficult to accept, not because of insufficient performance, but because of the deviation between the character image and the expression in the book. When Dune 2 was released, I also heard fans of Dune novels expressing dissatisfaction with Villeneuve's adaptation in the movie, but this did not prevent me from enjoying the Dune series and buying back the novel to read - this is the most important role that an IP series should play, allowing the IP audience to continuously spread to the outside world and attract more viewers. The Chinese TV series ""The Three Body Problem"" undoubtedly excels in restoring characters and scenery much better than Netflix, but its extensive efforts in restoring novels - I cannot bear to criticize - have made the series very long and sluggish. Apart from fans, no one likes to watch a few people chatting in the same room for thirty minutes. My parents persisted for ten minutes, and I persisted for eight episodes. The data does not lie. The Chinese TV series ""Three Body Problem"", which was launched on China Central Television and mainstream streaming media networks, saw a drop in viewership to only hover around 1% in the middle stage. Considering the great efforts of the creators, this cannot be said to be a huge failure. That's also why I have such a high tolerance for Netflix's ""Three Body Problem"" series - it's shallow, simple, and even somewhat flattering, but it makes ordinary audiences watch it, and that's its victory, that's the cruel mass media.In Journey to the West, Sun Wukong did not worship a turtle as his teacher, nor did he have a divine dragon and seven dragon balls that could fulfill human wishes. However, this did not prevent Mr. Akira Toriyama from creating the great Dragon Ball comic, and more people searched for ancient Chinese classics because of it. I hope Netflix's ""Three Body Problem"" can have the same effect and attract more foreign friends to appreciate our excellent science fiction works in China. ""Three Body Problem"" contains Eastern people's thoughts on human destiny and nature, which may not be correct, but in a certain direction.Love comes from China for you.",IMDB,An evaluation from a Chinese science fiction fan audience,8.0
"It goes without saying I suppose that the series is beautiful to watch. The acting is solid but the story and some characters are badly flawed. The largest gaping hole it seems to me is the San-Ti travel time vs Human's progress. The San-Ti are apparently much more advanced than humans but somehow, now that they have escaped their destructive world, their progress will go into stasis. Wut? Also, despite the fact that our entire world has looming extermination in our sights a few scientists have trouble disposing of the San-Ti's cohort here on Earth. Wut? There are other holes too that are irritating but you get the idea. If you want to watch a good movie (only an hour and a half long!) about quantum mechanics check out Coherence.

"First of all I want to say I agree with the reviews about the choice of actors. Why does it always have to be young females (late 20s) who plays leaders of big organisations and departments and brilliant doctors of theoretical physics etc.? Does anyone know how long it takes just to get through the education in university to get the phd degree? And then you need to work many years and publish a lot to become ""someone"" of importance. I'm sure these are supposed to be the most brilliant people on the planet (!) but it's still very unbelievable.Netflix (and others): There are lots of wonderful female actors 40-50+ to play these roles much better and more genuinely.Same goes for the guys mostly.Second, the acting and the personal plot twists are not so interesting, except for Jin's experiences in the game, where she actually develops some insight.However the others' stories seem fleeting and irrelevant. Interesting points fade away (like the numbers seem by one actor in the beginning..).. why? No follow up?Lastly, after the first 3-4 episodes the pace slows down, we now know ""what's coming"" and it gets quite boring with the retrospect parts. I fell asleep actually.

It appears Netflix is suffering from the chaotic instability of the three-body problem and somehow managed to turn this from a well-regarded sci-fi book into a ridiculous 20 something teen. Nothing much happens over emotional bunch of garbage show that will just waste your time and make you wish actual aliens invaded us for the sins of Netflix.I rarely will leave a review but the last four episodes were just so goddamn bad.

In Liu's hands, this concept serves as a metaphor for the intricate interconnectedness of individuals and societies, as well as the unpredictable consequences of our actions.Throughout the series, Liu poses thought-provoking questions about the nature of progress and the potential pitfalls of unchecked technological advancement. From the ethical dilemmas surrounding artificial intelligence to the existential risks posed by advanced extraterrestrial civilizations, the ""Series 3 Body Problem"" forces readers to confront the complex moral and philosophical quandaries of the modern age.In addition to its thematic depth, the ""Series 3 Body Problem"" is lauded for its meticulous attention to scientific detail.

As readers journey through the vast reaches of space and the depths of the human soul, they are sure to be captivated by the brilliance and complexity of Cixin Liu's masterwork.",IMDB,Good Series Because,9.0
"As someone who didn't read the books, I have mixed feelings.While the first half of the season gradually built up to a great catastrophe, the second half could have been condensed and saved for a second season.Some of the characters, like Auggie, Jin and Ye, are very interesting to watch but a good few of them feel very unserious for a good portion of the time, so it broke lots of the tension and seriousness I enjoyed about the show.There are many, many small plot holes surrounding the Santis and their purpose. Certain pieces of their story and mission contradict or go without explanation. I'm sure the books are probably more precise about this, but for one I didn't enjoy that this story is primarily about humans being pitted against each other in seemingly shallow, emotion-driven conflict when these characters were introduced as powerful scientists and leaders. At one point, the Santis display their immense power and control over humanity with their technology and are nothing short of terrifying. A psychotic, one-note zealot isn't enough to create an interesting villain and we need to expand on this.The highs are really high and I appreciated that.

If you understand the core messages and emotions that the books were trying to convey and elicit in its readers, rest assured this show adapts them well to the cinematic screen.

"...before watching this series. I admit, I have read the book and therefore have a preconcieved opinion. The parts that is about the chinese in the 60s is pretty accurate and follows the heart of the book, but the other things is heavily massacred with so called ""inclusion"" (that usually is written in the contracts before anyone can make anything) that pretty much always breaks immersion on everything where it appears.I think I could live with that sign of the times if I hadnt read the book since that policy is implemented in everything nowadays. The book concentrates on the story, not to please people on what once was twitter.Thank god Benidoff and Weiss didnt have to bow for that ""propaganda"" when they created Game of Thrones. Unfortunately they had to adapt and by doing so they missed their opportunity to make another ground breaking show.",IMDB,Dont read the book,6.0
"In Episode 05, Sophon tells Wade and Jin Cheng, that San-Ti's planet is unstable so they don't have much time to improve their technology compared to Earth.That is not necessarily true because human civilization also faces the same hurdles as the San-Ti in the form of Ice Age. Holocene, the interglacial period we're in, happens to be longer than the previous ones, giving us much time to improve our technology from farming, to industrial revolution, to atomic bomb, to computer and information age.The big difference is that we achieve all that in one go, uninterrupted. So, instead of demeaning and calling us bugs, the San-Ti should worship us as gods. Flawless, but divine nonetheless.Anyways, for all of it flaws, 3 Body Problem breathes a fresh air to sci-fi genre, which for too long has defied the laws of physics -- for instance, people travelling at the speed of light don't seem to be affected by time dilation, and come back to find there loved ones the same age as when they left them (what kinda bulltit is that?).",IMDB,(potentially) big hole in the plot,9.0
"...it wasn't presented to me in 4K HDR and yet I found the imagery much more enthralling.It was translated, subtitled, and spent much more time explaining science and engineering concepts, and yet I found the dialogue much less insulting.It didn't have Eiza Gonzalez, but also, it didn't have Eiza Gonzalez. (picking on Eiza as a famous name here, but in general I found the show to be miscast).It can't be binge-watched (or you will likely find it too long), but in trade you are really able to understand the characters and their motivations.It does a much better job in creating mystery and suspense and the action scenes are much better.Although the 3-body story clearly takes liberties in imagining the bounds based on current modern science, this is really what makes it great and I feel like the roots in real science were lost in the Netflix version. The Tencent version did a good job in presenting a story that is beautiful, interesting, at times exciting, but also seemingly very authentic.While the Tencent version did seem a little long to me, I think society (including myself) needs to keep some practice at having the patience to enjoy something that is not always fast moving with over-emotional characters, simple dialogue, and instant gratification.",IMDB,The Tencent Version is Better...,6.0
"'' 3 Body Problem '' is a sci fi series.I haven't read the book or watched the 2023 chinese series, but this one was good enough. The first episodes were especially enjoyable and entertaining, with intense drama and enough thriller.The second part was not as thrilling though, and some parts were boring and felt more like a filler, with long dialogues.The performances were, on the other hand, pretty great by everyone in the cast and all of them did a good job with their characters.The sci fi was also well presented and handled, with good CGI that didn't ruin the series.So, overall, seven out of ten.",IMDB,Good Enough,7.0
"Saw this mysterious series starting on Netflix and decided to give it a try. I had never heard of the books, so I had no idea what this was about, but very quickly realized, okay, it's an alien invasion story. Let's see where this goes.The initial setup was intriguing with the visions, the VR headset, and some kind of secret investigation into all of it. And then it all fell apart for me in one scene - the scene where the alien cult leader on the ship is telling his alien overlords the story of Little Red Riding Hood, and they just don't get it. The alien voice says it's a lie and becomes shocked and horrified that humans lie! Then the aliens cut off all communication based on this revelation.Really? An alien species that has access to every aspect of human civilization doesn't know this?The aliens communicate using an elaborate VR game that represents their world's survival problem, and they don't get metaphor? It IS a metaphor.The aliens display themselves as a Ninja lady because their real form would be too disturbing for the humans, and they don't recognize this as deception... i.e., lying?Then when the leader of the intelligence agency along with other smart characters all put on their VR headsets to view the aliens' presentation on sophons, none of them call the aliens out on their obvious BS. They've all heard the recording of the conversation. Why don't any of these smart people say, ""Hey, aliens, you're lying to us right now by not revealing your true form! And you're so smart yet you don't get that the wolf story was a metaphor about not trusting people... exactly the lesson you learned, and we should have learned, because that's how we teach children.""
Nope, no character ever realizes this, which means none of the writers realize it either. In fact, it's like the writers have never seen an alien invasion movie in their life. They play with these tropes like they just discovered them for the first time ever. While we the viewers have seen these things used in countless media.Thematically, there's an exchange that sums up this entire series. The intel director asks the Chinese investigator,""You're going to be watching this kid for the rest of your life, are you okay with that?""
The investigator replies, ""Do I have a choice?""
The director says, ""No.""
The investigator answers, ""Then I'm okay with it.""From the beginning when the young Chinese girl is taken to work at the observatory to this point, no one seems to have any choice. Even the guy who refuses to be a ""Wall Watcher"" (or whatever it is) ultimately has no choice. The nanofiber girl wants out, but they still use her work for the ill fated frozen head project... which is so dumb... such an incredibly dumb idea, and yet no one can speak up and say that. It almost makes you forgive the lady who called the aliens in the first place. Because thematically, we're just replacing one authoritarian system for another and hoping the next one is more benevolent and effective.They clearly need to call up a Bruce Willis or Will Smith to deal with these aliens, because the current team is not up to the task...",IMDB,Way more than 3 problems,1.0
"I get it, it kinda sucks when they don't stick with the source material, but I think it's fine in this case. It's not a 100% accurate adaptation anyway, since they wanted to make it more ""international"", and that's okay -- you can change some characters and still retain the main story elements.They cut a lot from the story, but let's face it, the first halves of the first two books were not that great. There was plenty -- and I mean plenty -- to cut; the books had a jarring amount of exposition, irrelevant stories, and mathematical jargon. I mean, yeah, the math and science bits were interesting in themselves, but they don't exactly make a good story for a book.Sure, maybe they cut a bit too much at some points, like there happened a lot more in the Red Coast, they could have added a bit more of that. And I get that they cut off some the ETO stuff, which was quite boring at times, but not to mention the ETO even with one word? Yeah, maybe they went a bit far with that one. But other than that, I think the changes were good. Generally, they managed to cut the boring parts and expanded on the more interesting details and made the overall story much more cohesive. I think it was mainly for the better.It's a great show, acting, casting, and script is mostly good. Sure, it's not a masterpiece, but I liked it and it was entertaining and kept me on the hook. I literally binge-watched this in two days, so it is not really that bad at all. Give it a shot, it's only going to get better, as the story progresses and starts to show its more unique aspects. (I just hope they cut the boring bits about the second book, as well. Like, I seriously hope that one third of the season is not that random, irrelevant romance in the forest BS that had zero effect on the story.)",IMDB,"Yeah, they changed a lot, but it's still good",8.0
"It's a pretty great show no doubt but the women in this show, you will hate them for sure.Everything else is great except for this one particular recurring thing.The women, firstly it's Ye, she does something that jeopardizes the entire world and virtually dooms the future generation and somehow she is the victim and somehow she did it foe the greater good.Then Jin, she is basically responsible for the death of her best friend and yet she doesn't even stop or show any remorse in her actions to keep going, it's like she is desperate for some purpose.Then Auggie, where do I even begin with this one, yeash, she is responsible for the death of a 1000 people and she acts like she is concerned or cares but still she has all the power to stop it but she won't and soon after she wants to act like she cares and tries to blame some guy who knows exactly his mission and juat doing his job, from the moment her character gets the spotlight, she is just a roller coaster of hypocrisyThe women characters in this show do the most heavy wait but they also are responsible for the problems create from the beginning, and yet we must endure their hypocrisy and ridiculousness.",IMDB,"It's a pretty great show no doubt but the women in this show, you will hate them for sure in the show you will hate them",8.0
"I think for the most part this show is good. Jin and Will are standout characters for sure, they feel very real and do a really good job with the emotional scenes and making us feel what their characters are going through. Some of the concepts are awesome to see too, I was fascinated by how each of the civilizations collapsed. With the sun shrinking in the sky as the planet gets pulled gets pulled away from it and freezes, or the gravity of the combined suns pulling everything off the planet... wow! That was super cool. The boat scene with the nanofibers was pretty wild too.My biggest knock on this series is that even though, yes, it's science FICTION, it takes itself very seriously and I sometimes found myself thinking alllllright, really? They made the aliens a fairly complicated matter, with those things that fly around the earth and can be anywhere at anytime listening to everything...? Not to mention the plan of detonating 30+ nukes in outer space to propel a spaceship to lightspeed. They were disappointed that the tethers holding the parachute to the capsule break... but a literal nuke is going off in between the capsule and the shute over and over again. Not sure what they were expecting there. It all just seemed a bit ridiculous, and a show that started out feeling like it could be a realistic take on an alien encounter sort of turns into nonsense. Entertaining nonsense, though.I also can't see Ser Davos as anything other than Ser Davos. He even sounds the same. Sam Tarly took a minute for me but he sold that role. Obviously a personal issue but other game of thrones enjoyers might feel the same.Just to add: I thought Auggie was incredibly annoying. Every scene she was in felt like such a drag. Always negative, always moping and being arrogant. I would hate her in real lifeFunniest part of the show was Saul insisting he doesn't need protection, and then walks outside and immediately gets shot.",IMDB,"It's a stretch, but it's pretty good",6.0

"The series is well produced has some good acting and kept me entertained. The concept behind the plot is fascinating and original. I have not read the books yet but I did watch the Chinese produced series after the Netflix.I'm not going to drive into which series is better, far too subjective of a task. I will say I enjoyed both productions very much though for different reasons.I am not sure if dividing a main character from the book into 5 separate screen characters is the best route but it works ok here. The characters were relatable and this adaptation allowed for a more efficient story line.It did feet like the later episodes really wanted to go all out ""Independance Day"" in dealing with the impending crisis. This began to overshadow what, for me, was super interesting: is all out war the only or best approach such an event?If you are seeking a new sci-fi series you'll likely find this entertaining and satisfying. If you do want to go further down the rabbit hole, the Chinese series is worth a look also.",IMDB,Well worth the watch,7.0
"This is extremely faithful to the books, not just faithful but even more than it would be as a 1 on 1 adaptation, it expands upon the idea and tells it in a very different way but relatively the same, it even incorporates the ""4th"" book by Bau Shu. The creators of this show not just show love for the plot, but really show the world, the drama, the characters because honestly this is the version that works as a TV series. You have to pay attention to every detail, to every sentence in order to get a full idea what is going on, but this approach is really well fit for a TV-show. Episode 5 is one of the best pieces of media I've ever seen. That episode itself completely let go of the brakes, and you can't even blink, so if you loved the books, if you gave the books the recognition they deserve, then please do the same with the TV-show because this is Netflix one of if not the best adaptation ever and I guarantee you will put it into your TOP 5 Sci-fi series you've ever watched.",IMDB,Whoever made a review based on the first episode is crazy.,10.0
"I have read both trilogy books and watch Chinese version of the show so suffice to say I'm a fan of the source material. I had high hope because Chinese ver had very limited budgeted (1/20th of Netflix ver). But overall the Netflix adaptation left some mixed feelings in my mouth.THE GOODS
Relatively faithful adaptation event-wise. That is to say, everything happens in the book happens in the show.Mostly excellent casting lineup and performance.Captures overall vibes of the book very well.THE BADS
Way too rushed. First episodes covered more than half of first book so nothing is earned. This left many plot holes which you will notice the moment you start ponder what happened.Terrible CGI especially in latter episodes. Like, no spoilers but one of finale had worse CGI than Chinese ver which is like again 1/20th of budget. How?Dumb down of some key scenes and scientific concepts. This made them less scary and impactful, like the final scene in the first episode. In the book and Chinese ver, there's science (sure, sci-fi science but still) behind everything. In Netflix of the show, a lot of things are in pure fantasy territory.THE UGLYS
Relationship between character is forced. In the original book, all major characters in the first book have different backgrounds but came together because of the plot. They don't know each other and of course there was no love relationship between them. In the show, most are from Oxford alumni and they were couples and love interests. Also, everyone just know each other without any explanation. This completely broke character dynamics between some characters. Also, it doesn't have the grand scale feeling the book has because you know, everyone knows and sleeps with each other and are all in London.Adding new plot to characters (eg., Evans) without changing their motivations and bring characters from different book (eg., Wade, Luoji/Saul, etc) for no reason. This completely breaks their motivational and as a result, a lot of things felt forced.Ye Wenjie's casting and some key plot choice writer forced on her are beyond terrible. She is one of, if not the most, important character in the book so she has complex motivations and character arc, which is required especially toward the reveal in end of 2nd book's finale. In the show, she is very one dimension character and that only dimension is hatred and it makes no sense.Overall, Netflix's 3 Body adaptation is watchable, but a huge waste of source material's potential because producer/writer had to force their incompatible idea on it. It's remind me of Apple's adaptation of Asimov's Foundation - a decent watchable show, but disappointment for what it could have been.",IMDB,Decent show but relatively poor adaptation,6.0
"I love that this show (presumably book as well) spends some serious effort on explaining some real physics -- the ""3 body problem"" is literally in the title, and a fundamental focus at least for the first few episodes. But here's the 4 body problem: 1) The actions of the aliens literally make no sense. On the one had their technology is far, far more advanced than ours, one the other hand, they need us, then, on the other hand, we are just bugs (and why even bother with that message?), then, on the other hand, they need two specific people killed, and one groomed .... this is all unexplained, but I will submit now: it's nonsense * 10^23. 2) There's lots of other ""science"" in this series that is completely unbelievable, else, makes no sense. With the exception of nuclear detonation sequence to launch a probe (one well established option for interstellar travel) and the initial 3-body problem explained ... the science in this series is completely fantastical. 3) As other reviewers noted -- there is little to no attachment to any of the characters at all, save perhaps, Jin. One cannot have humanity in peril, and then have us appreciate that one is unhappy with her work, so she quits. Or one is emotionally torn. Everyone's entire existence is on the line. The ""evil doers"" are also mostly cardboard cutouts so far -- no dramatic tension really, save perhaps Ye Wenjie, but it is fleeting. See ""The Last of Us"" for some real grit characters. We will see how they handle engaging the audience .... across 400 years? Same problem Foundation faces 4) The actions of the humans literally make no sense -- we dice up an entire cruise ship and magically know it will a) kill all the people b) preserve all the evidence? I literally don't get the probe launch thing -- was this entire thing a gigantic mulligan?Humans: proceed with caution.",IMDB,Make it make sense,9.0
"I enjoyed this tremendously and look forward to the next season. I have read the book and loved it, and have been concerned that it would be very hard to put on screen, especially in 8 episodes. But they did a great job. There are many changes from the book. The show is centered in London. Some characters have been westernized and there is more relationship drama. Some plot points have been dropped and others added. These changes are reasonable, though some worked and some didn't. Overall though excellent job. I do think it will be hard to understand a lot of things without reading the book but not impossible if you pay attention.Benedict Wong is excellent as are John Bradley, Zine Tseng, Liam Cunningham, Alex Sharp and Jess HongMy criticisms are: the Auggie character is poorly written. Eiza Gonzalez is very bad in the role and grating. She almost ruins the show. The motivations of the cult people are not well explained. The show slows down in the middle with the Alex drama and all the relationship stuff and some of that time could have been used for more expository stuff and providing backstory as in the first few episodes. The early episodes were paced brilliantly.I have not read the second book. I started it and found it confusing. I will try again.",IMDB,Excellent show and very good adaptation,7.0
"Eiza Gonzalez character Dr. Salazar almost ruin this show for me. Her character didn't fit well with the rest of the group.

I understand time was a factor and perhaps the San-Ti would have known there was a mold inside the ship but Wade actions were genocide like.

"I have never read the source material so I have no insights on how it compares to the novel or even the other adaptation. I have tried to watch this series with a completely open mind and no expectations. With that said, I actually enjoyed the first 5 episodes of this series and would give them 7.5/10. I watched a lot of episodes in one weekend. However, the show starts to lose steam and struggle after the fifth episode.This series has had some issues from the beginning but I was willing to overlook them to see where the compelling story was headed. Some of the plot points and concepts are very interesting but the execution in showcasing them can often fall short. Sometimes scenes are great, other times there are glaring issues. The problem is that many of these issues are amplified 10x in episode 6 and beyond.After the big revelation, the episodes mostly become a melodrama about uninteresting characters. Many of them don't seem to actually care about the events that just unfolded or the main plot line. They are too busy being involved in their own personal problems rather than putting all of that aside to focus on what is most important. The main scientist friends group drama is mind numbingly boring to watch at times.Jin and Auggie can be arrogant and obnoxious. This is extremely off putting as most of their esteem seems completely unearned. These characters are not believable as accomplished scientists. There are millions of scientists and other intelligent people that apparently can't keep up with an alcoholic that never does any work or a physicist that has nothing going for her other than a boyfriend out of her league.This supposedly brilliant duo of elite scientists does their level best to show you how naive or immature they are. They make disparaging remarks against Raj and Wade while acting like moody teenagers. Raj and Wade are both intelligent, cogent and exude competence. Wade carries his scenes so well and is a pleasure to watch. Wade is clearly focused on what is important and is actually trying to win a war of survival.Meanwhile, the 2 most brilliant women are seemingly irreplaceable but can't decide if their values line up with the men enough to help save humanity from extinction. Auggie is beyond insufferable and Jin is mostly bland. Thankfully, there are some great characters and plot points to work with. I hope they trim the worst elements as they have the recipe here for a great series.",IMDB,A potentially great series that settles for being decent with some flaws,10.0

However, after the first two episodes, I found myself completely hooked on the plot and couldn't believe how addictive the series became.

No surprise that the cinematography, and general storyboarding is excellent, but the story itself brings some novel concepts to sci fi.

There are many great moments, and some great black humor but the end of life scene acting was phenomenal and heart wrenching. And Eiza Gonzalez...Well , and I've probably wrecked it now, but I have to say she is the hottest girl in sci-fi I've ever seen. Hotter even than seven of nine.I can't wait for the next 3 series if they get the go ahead.

In an eight-episode series, we expect the action to pick up towards the sixth episode and peak at seven and eight, but this is not the case at all in this series.

"Never read the book but had some friends who did and were excited about these series.So I watched the show on Netflix and my own impressions were:
a) Didn't feel at all like a $20M/episode budget that they spent. Where did the money go?B) Overall OK and somewhat interesting, mainly due to lack of other new Sci-Fi shows with some level of originality.C) Lots of plot holes, logical issues, bad science that's basically magic, some facts magically appearing without taking time to solve problems and mysteries, lack of answers to many questions, and other issues that made me assume that the book was quite bad.D) Too much DEI, with the show not driven by pure talent but by the need to satisfy political requirements.But then I've decided to watch the Chinese series based on the same book, playing on Amazon Video. And that's when I realized how much better the Chinese version is at only $1M/episode. That one does feel like little lower budget but not big much. And is is very slow-paced at 30 episodes (for Season 1), but it does have much better story with actual mysteries being discovered and then solved, vs magically appearing facts and problems in the American/Netflix version.Now I've lost all respect for this Netflix show, just by knowing how much better, logical and mysterious it could be. Basically I'm very disappointed with Netflix screwing this show so badly.",IMDB,Almost trash compared to Chinese version,8.0
"This series disembodied the book. So if you're seeking a faithful adaptation that captures the book's essence you might prefer the Chinese version.Though armed with a higher production budget than the Chinese version, evident in the special effects, it comes at the cost of some plot details. In this retelling, there are more bodies to follow, too. In fact, this series adds 5 new characters who take on some of the roles originally filled by one character in the book. As I viewer I struggled to find them compelling enough or necessary. Maybe it is because I've read the book and seen enough of the Chinese version that makes me think that these writers had an opportunity to create a better adaptation.

"I remember getting blown away by the books 10 years ago and thinking to myself: pity this is unfilmable.But what a job they've done here. While the main setting was moved to England, the show remained faithful to the core sci-fi concepts and visualized the grand scale of them in truly stunning ways. That is no small feat and already halfway to success in my book - the Three-Body trilogy's ideas are the kind that stays with you for the rest of your life and to see them turned into a different medium so competently is just incredibly satisfying.My only complaint is that the charactor development was a bit one-dimensional. Sure, that isn't all that much in the souce material. But being the main antagonist does not mean Ye Wenjie should be looking stern 99% of the time.All in all this is a perfect companion to a modern classic.

The environment of the movie pressurizes the girl to choose the way, but it's the same in the reality, this movie is the real warning towards society, that now environment can make a very huge impact to the young generations now, scientist are not being heard much but influencers are being the top of the interest among young people, scientist now had been becoming lesser influence each year, that only a major incident happened could make us people feel the existence of scientist. Overall not a bad movie, shocking views and I recommend to CHINA Chinese to see, watch, and not brainwashed by all the parties, they should understand and not being covered by all these mess the government had created, this is a movie targeted to Chinese, that I must say the environment creates people, edits people, changes people.",IMDB,Movie impacts towards society.,1.0
"The series starts of strong with the setting in China in the '60's. It's mysterious and interesting. The premise of the countdown is different but plausible, the search for the reason of scientist's suicides is thrilling and really draws you in. As you go on though, you realise alarmingly obvious plotholes, the dialogue throughout is painfully awkward and the success of the characters at such a young age is unrealistic. The CGI is jarring at times and the premise of the 'game' is not executed as well as in the books. Questions that are built on in the first few episodes are entirely ignored until the last episode but the answers are not hinted at, at all so the viewer forgets about an important aspect leading to the reveal feeling sudden and forced.",IMDB,Becomes worse as you go on,6.0
"The book? Never read it. So I can neither recommend nor pan this as an adaptation. I take it as it gives itself which in impressive ways is spectacular. Visuals, especially in-game are something to behold. The story, long though it develop, is filled with twists you probably couldn't anticipate but they aren't introduced simply to snap your head. The story, as it develops presents vexing problems that are solved (or solved for now) unconventionally by individuals with unlikely but preparatory interests or expertise, so, however out there, bizarre solutions seem obviously the right thing to do. Even though, it turns out, nothing can be undertaken that isn't already anticipated. The enemy (I'll here not give them away) immediately knows every decision made by anybody so no action taken can be a surprise. But it turns out humans aren't entirely without recourse in the face of seemingly all-knowing ""whatever they are"" things. If I find fault, it's the casting on the whole. Rather drab but there are standouts. Benedict Wong as a rumpled agent of a security agency is very good. And I just have an affection for Liam Cunningham who here plays the "" He's very bad. He's very good"" boss of earth's opposition and so every character's challenge to think beyond themselves or fail or quit or act exasperated. All in all, these initial eight episodes entertain emotionally and exercise the old brain too.",IMDB,"Stunning visuals, Unexpected twists M it Worthwhile",9.0
"You hear and read all the buzz about a particular movie or show streaming, yet you resist because you've been more often let down than blown away by how much mid to sub par programming is out there these days.3 Body Problem does a decent job, but far from great. I won't belabor with too much of a synopsis yet go in to what makes the show just ok.The biggest issue, just like with saw with Game of Thrones and now with The Witcher, the makers of 3 Body Problem obviously are setting this up for a multi-series production. Good for them, but I am very turned off by these productions that are kept open ended. Even complicated novels like GoT, if I wanted all the nuances of the books, I would be reading the books. I watch movies and TV shows to deliver a story with an engaging plot, good characters and engaging scenes, sets and graphics. 3 Body Problem got most of this right at first, but then just meandered, not even crashed, off the rails. Which is even more damning, since if it had gone cuckoo crazy, that would have been a lot better.Unfortunately, when you have a complicated story, you need a good plot and characters. With 3 Body Problem, both of these were delivered in middling way. Yes, I understand science is being bent to tell a story here, yet some of the mumbo jumbo in 3 Body Problem was just that, and it showed.When S2 comes out, I'm more than likely not to watch it.",IMDB,"Enjoyable, but goes from 8 to 6",6.0
"As adaptations go, this month (March 24) has been a real winner. Firstly Dune Part 2, blockbustering it's way beyond all expectation whilst maintaining the essence of the book, and now 3 Body - potentially a disaster - succeeding against the odds.To compress the concepts, relocate much of the action, and condense the character range into a dynamic, watchable and comprehensible series really is quite a feat.Numerous changes (but nothing essential) to the OG Chinese hard scifi thrills have worked; all round fine acting seamlessly merges drama and science for any casual audience to engage.Of course, book fiends will have contentions - there's a few missing things I'd like to have seen myself regards the science expo - but overall it's credit where credit's due in pulling off a startlingly fine 8 episodes that cover the first book, and leave a buzz for what's to come.I watched the 30 episode, faithful, Chinese language adaptation by Tencent last year and can recommend it as well for a more measured, detailed beat by beat telling of the first book. A good comparison for this Netflix exercise.So I sincerely hope Netflix go ahead with the rest of the trilogy because it'll be quite a challenge to translate the futuristic, epoch-spanning events into relatable episodic TV.God knows we need some quality among the streaming service dross. After this pretty scintillating start to an 'unfilmable' literal epic, I'm looking forward to Season 2 immensely. Hurry up and announce it.",IMDB,No Problem,8.0
"As a computer scientist with a solid understanding of physics, I didn't find a single scientific explanation that made sense. The arguments are often centered around the notion that ""Science is broken"" or that ""the Universe is ignoring the laws of physics"" while the characters that are supposed to be highly talented Oxford students lose all scientific rigor simply because they are scientists and are expected to be skeptical and atheist by nature, leading them to deny everything like if they were very afraid to start thinking maybe god exists. At times, it seemed like a parody of skepticism and atheism from an overly dumb perspective.While I found it entertaining, I couldn't help but be put off by their depiction of a parallel world where all scientists are portrayed as idiots and the existence of god is their biggest fear.",IMDB,"Not science fiction, but rather fantasy aiming to mock skepticism",6.0

1. An entire high intelligence specie is invading earth because one in 7 billion people send them an invitation? I mean, what if no one answered, they would just die?2.

Since they monitor everything, they should know, by the time they arrive, we would have destroyed earth either by war, global warming ... etc. We are a self destructive specie, just give us time and we will do it for you.4. There is five known extinction on earth that wiped out life completely, how earth is still a viable option?5. A specie evolved in planet of three stars would definitely perish in a different environment. Humans are already struggling with few degrees increase of temperature due to global warming.6. If they were a high intelligence specie, they would have incited wars by recruiting agents and rest assure we will wipe ourselves out and earth will be ready for them when they arrive. By sending us warning, they actually united the human race against them and accelerated our development.7. Dont start with the lying thing. Even animals lies to hunt their preys. They claim to have studied our history, they should know better that our history was based on deception and lies since the beginning of time but they were shocked when they learn we lie from the red hood girl children story .. lol.8.

"In short, watch it. I really enjoyed it. It's hard to offer an unbiased critique since I want the series to be successful, and it's one of my favorite stories (spanning three books). On the other hand, it's frustrating to see drastic changes or to have elements I really enjoyed in the book left out. Often, it feels rushed, and it is. For example, the central mystery that you uncover in the middle of the first book is revealed by the second episode.But it's an adaptation. And like all adaptations, there will be alterations, differences, and interpretations. For comparison, a Chinese series covering the entire first book in 30 episodes (almost 25 hours) was made. The Netflix series does the same in 5 episodes (almost 5 hours). The Chinese version covers every detail but is slow-paced and dense. Obviously, many details are left out in the Netflix version, but I understand the choices, and in the end, I liked them. The first book is a large prologue to the story, and the most incredible parts actually happen in the second and third books. So, it's okay for Netflix to quickly cover the first part and give a taste of what will be the central point of the second book.A point to note in the series is the lack of character development. Not that it's spectacular in the book, but Netflix blended characters, created new ones, so there's a lack of involvement. However, it already brought elements from the 2nd and 3rd books to give more cohesion between the three books. At first, this bothered me, but in the end, I was comfortable with it and think it will work well throughout the series. The essence of the story, the creative script, and what makes the book sensational are there. It could have characters you liked more, but in the end, the story isn't about them. It's about something broader related to humanity, its evolution, and cosmic questions.So, watch it without fear, and I hope you have fun :) and of course, if you can read the books first, highly recommended!",IMDB,Great serie adaptation and some book comments without spoilers,10.0
"Fantastic sci-fi thats entertaining, thought provoking and at times moving. It's rare for a high concept series to mesh cerebral with an effecting story and this manages it.There are some elements that are left unexplored and that perhaps could have been fleshed out but I guess it's tough to integrate everything from a book. The acting is mostly on point, although some characterisations don't necessarily make a lot of sense given their position. The science is explained well although again there are times when the series does bend the reality of certain elements such that someone knowledgable in that area will roll their eyes.Highly recommended and I hope Netflix makes the next two series to round out the trilogy.",IMDB,Superb,10.0
"She is not a good actress. Her emotionless face makes it impossible to connect. Looking at a fixed point without reacting is not acting. She spends the whole series with a look of surprise and fear, but it's just an attempt because she doesn't succeed. I'm sorry, but with such a big budget they could have hired someone who could act. The rest of the casting is fine. Especially the Chinese. In general there is a greater repertoire of emotions. I mean, they know how to act.On the other hand, the story is good. The creators make the impossible, possible. But they made a mistake with the protagonist.",IMDB,"Sorry, but casting",7.0

I will say that I am still somewhat cautious about how future seasons (if there are any) will play out given the debacle that I felt befell the ending of HBO's Game of Thrones.

"Alright, so I was really hyped to jump into ""3 Body Problem"" because, you know, sci-fi is my jam. But man, those first couple of episodes? They were just... meh. I couldn't quite get into it. Then, surprise surprise, things started picking up from episode three to five. I was all in, loving the mystery and excitement.But then, out of nowhere, episode six hits, and it's like the show did a 180. Suddenly, we're knee-deep in melodrama, and I'm left scratching my head wondering what the heck happened to the cool sci-fi vibe.And let's talk about Augie. At first, she was solid and likable. But as the show went on, she turned into this annoying character that made me roll my eyes more than anything else.Honestly, ""3 Body Problem"" just couldn't stick to its guns. It started off promising but lost its way with all the unnecessary drama. As a sci-fi fan, I felt let down. I wanted a pure genre experience, and instead, I got a mishmash of confusion.So yeah, if you're into straightforward sci-fi without all the extra fluff, this one might not hit the mark for you.",IMDB,Pretty good to pretty bad.,6.0

The story is somewhat simplified, and moving less characters to keep the focus, but it's understandable. I do not like every change they made, but I still think that they made a good job.The characters are good, I liked Da Shi (the officer) the most, he is almost exactly how I imagined him.Maybe this will be a redemption arc for D&D.

"Science facts: alfa centaury is a two sun system with an attached red dwarf sun (Proxima centaury). And no: not all three body systems are chaotic (see Sun-Earth-Moon). Three or multi body systems used to be a scientific challenge back in the day (10th century) without computers. Some claimed it is an proof that science is not capable of being a replacement for religion. Today multi body systems can be simulated with tremendous precision for very long periods of time. Most of them are very stable. It depends on the distribution of masses. In the solar system the sun has > 99% of the overall mass which makes it stable. For Alfa Centaury this is not the case. The two suns orbit each other in a stable way. But for smaller planets there is a good chance to not have a stable orbit and sooner or later they get kicked out. Unlikely that any inhabitable planet exists there - but we don't know. The story as such has some good ideas. But as it is supposed to be close to reality (not like Star Wars or Star Trek) other stuff just doesn't fit (invisible characters etc). The acting is a little of. And there are some characters that simply slow down things without adding much for the story telling. Like with any series: every time momentum builds - it shortly after breaks down and we go back to slow story telling to get enough material for 8 episodes and potential sequels. IMHO this KILLS any good entertainment. After a while, no matter how good the ideas are, it simply get boring and one looses focus. Again: some really good story ideas but stretched out so much - all ""fire"" fades to gray.",IMDB,Good for a series - but could be much better if shorter,6.0
"I've read the books.I've also seen the Chinese adaptation.And I am intimately familiar with the physics. Which is to say, I know that, strictly speaking, the premise of the story is nonsense. But never mind that. There is a reason why ""fiction"" is part of science-fiction. It's okay for a fictitious universe to have fictitious rules governing its existence, so long as the author stays true to the story's premise. That is why I was able to enjoy the books, suspending my disbelief, and that is why I find this adaptation quite enjoyable as well.Make no mistake about it, the Chinese version was really good quality television, despite it having been, relatively mildly but still obviously, censored in places. But this Netflix version has its own strengths. Shorter (the Chinese adaptation was 30 episodes!) but I do not feel it rushed. I presently just finished watching episode 6, with two more to go. Eager to see the rest.I am, of course, well aware of the dark forest to which this story takes us, so no major surprises there. However, I find that I can relate to, care for the characters: I find them believable, genuine. And although some of the story has been transplanted from China to the West in this adaptation, the essence of the novel stays intact. I understand that the show had mixed reception.All the more, I remain hopeful that nonetheless, season 2 will be greenlit and we can see the rest of the story unfold, including I hope the third book of the trilogy, which had some of the most memorably twists yet.",IMDB,Much better than I expected (or feared),9.0
"This is a sci-fi series from the creator of Game of Thrones that adapts a Hugo award-winning Chinese novel, but with almost all the characters changed to Westerners. It keeps only the major plot events and the Chinese female lead character from the beginning. While this aspect is done well, it completely loses the deeper Chinese political science content of the original. And viewers of the series cannot then go read the original novel. Additionally, the newly created characters become a group of drunken scientists full of Western-style personal life and romantic issues, which is an unnecessary aspect that the show labors on throughout. This greatly reduces the value of the original work.

"I lasted thro 2 1/2 episoed before turning this jibberish off. I'm ok with sci-fi stuff and other-worldy mumbo-jumbo, but when the plot requires super smart people to do super stupid things like allowing themself to get dragged into a video game, but they are playing because ""it seems fun and interesting"" without understanding how harmful it can be to them or what it does or where it comes from or how it works but taking huge risks with ther head is ok to them and a no-brainer, and all of this in order for the show to play out at all, that i have a problem with. Oh, and by the way, all the super smart poeple are young and sexy, well except one perhaps, and it becomes obvious who this is targeted to. Acting is half-baked, while the whole premise is on shaky legs. It's wonderfully intertwined and all, but when a show that wants to be super clever is based on a not so clever premise, as i said at the begining, then i'm done.",IMDB,super smart people doing super stupid stuff,2.0
"Too many reviews here are being unfairly critical of this newest adaptation considering the source material. There is a prior adaptation from Tencent films but no English translations just subtitles.The main characters are simplified in both origin (except Ye Winji) and interactions prior to involvement in the war. Coming from the books, what we have been given in season 1 is only a foundation of the series. There is a plethora of more to come, if the show goes through all three books (fingers crossed). There has been some backlash from Chinese news agencies who are harsh on the DEI/diversity of characters, meaning there was an extensive array of both male/female, including making book male characters into females, but also check boxing each race/ethnicity. Which is a valid argument considering the source material is almost all Chinese characters, except for Wade and the other Wallfacers.Where this show shines is the CGI! From the VR worlds of the Trisolaris, to the representation of the Sophon and the Eye in the Sky and least of all the end of Judgement Day. That episode alone was amazing from the practical effects (little paper dolls being invisibily sliced) to the grand effects (the whole ship essentially melting into a pile of scrap on the canal beach).",IMDB,Understanding the Source Material,9.0
"The three books by Liu Cixin changed my life. They are by far the best science fiction books I have ever read. The imagination, the science, the philosophy, these books are meant to change you, and the way you see the world and the universe.I was deeply worried about a Netflix adaptation, but I must say I have been glued to this show for it's entire runtime. The main elements are there, and well produced. The CGI is mostly on par, with some scenes far below the standard imposed by the recent Dune movies, but still sufficient for the experience to be great.The weak part of the books, although this is a matter of personal preference, has always been the human aspect of the grand story. The characters in every books (except maybe the second one), are bland, simple cogs in a massive wheel that is the fate of the unierse.The writers here decided to take a different route by embedding this grand story in a very human-scale story of friendship and love between five(six) humans. I was not sold at first, but quickly embraced it. Especially in the last few episodes of season 1. The first book is mostly covered in 5 episodes, so the episodes 6-7-8 use content from the other books and spend more time to dive in the characters who will all take the roles often given to secondary individuals, or by the single main character in the book. Note that in the book the main character does change between books.This decision by the co-producer is a great one, that will most likely displease those who want a perfect rendition. But even if you do decide that this british-centric group of friend is not your cup of tea (no pun intended), I cannot believe any fan of the book giving less than 7/10 for this one, since the main plot, and main events are respected in their whole. Although episodes 3-4-5 are the action-pacted one, I really enjoyed the human scale of episode 6-7-8, and it made me re-discover what is at stake in the books. Making me wish for a second season already.So if you enjoyed the book, don't read the negative reviews, plus yourself in, embrace the little differences, and enjoy.

"After binge-watching the 8 episodes of Netflix's ""The Three-Body Problem,"" as someone who has read the entire trilogy and watched Tencent's series closely following the first book, I consider the Netflix adaptation to be an ""good"" level US/UK drama. For those new to the ""Three-Body"" universe, I'd rate it between 7.5 to 8. However, compared to Tencent's detailed 30-episode adaptation, Netflix's attempt to cover the first book in just 6 episodes resulted in the loss of many essences from the book. Personally, the most disappointing aspect was the portrayal of Ye Wenjie. As a core character of the trilogy, she was depicted with much more depth and conviction in both the book and Tencent's version. Netflix's portrayal, however, was quite brief and made her level ""much lower"", leaving me and many other fans a bit disappointed. Nonetheless, it's still a good watch, especially for newcomers.

"Having not read the book prior to watching this is probably an advantage. While it retains many of the cultural revolution parts, the main bits are in the UK. Purists may not like this but I think for western viewers it makes sense.It is really well shot, the moral and scientific conundrums are good and while Westernised it doesn't have the usual Western tropes of good guys and bad guys, everyone is a bit of each and each has it's own perspective and rationality.The story goes along at a good pace, and most of the characters are interesting and well acted. The only one so far I have little interest in is Saul.What helps is both the pacing but also some unexpected turns, well unexpected for me.It is definitely more cerebral than most sci-fi these days, and as much as I liked the peripheral, this is a lot better.So I am sure purists won't like some of the transition to the wrst, Incel scifi nerds will do their head in at the multicultural/diverse cast and your average viewer will probably struggle with the fact you have to think and the fact no one is clean skin, it is definitely one of the best new shows of 2024.Hell it has even got me to buy the books, though I will read after watching, so as not to ruin both with preconceptions.",IMDB,Interesting and thought provoking,9.0

"It's missing all of the mistery, intrigue and thrill of the books. The characters, if they aren't removed they have different personalities and roles that are just worse. Here we have a group of ""academics"" that act more like teens from stranger things and dress like NY models and are all basic arquetypes. The sarcastic one, the reluctant hero, the clown, the sensitive one, the cynic... Really, you could take these characters and throw them in Stranger Things, or bring those here and they would fill each other's roles perfectly. It would be better with those characters here. At least the stranger things characters are deeper. In this show none of the characters have actual development.The pacing is just bad, there is no buildup for anything so the reveals all fall flat. It feels like if the creators thought that everyone had already read the books so there was no need for mistery or intrigue. The story seems to be on a rush, but they certainly have time for bad melodrama, gotcha moments and unfunny ""funny"" scenes.

"First off never read the books however I am a great lover of science fiction stories.Every episode is gripping.- well maybe apart from 7
and its a good story with lots of twists and turnsMaybe some of the cast members really do not fit the stereotypes of a professor but you do warm to themIts a series where you cannot wait to watch the next episodeAnd i like that is based in the UK gives it a different feel that i likedThe quality of the production is first class and i love the setsThere is so much rubbish out there at the moment its nice to watch a good science fiction seriesPlease Netflix sign season 2 !!",IMDB,Great story cannot wait for season 2,6.0
"The series has a remarkable story, excellent production and the visual effects are satisfactory. But it's a boring series and I'll prove in the text below that it is, pay attention:
The story begins 'woman' with a series of 'woman' events that at first don't make 'woman' much sense, 'woman' scientists begin to look for brilliant minds 'woman' to solve the 'woman' problem in question, and guess what only woman'? All ""brilliant"" minds are women! THAT'S NEW, ISN'T IT? With 'woman' except a dying white man and 'woman' a drugged black man, the rest 'woman' goes almost unnoticed, even the 'woman' such as LORD is a 'woman' WOMAN.... Well, that's right. Is.... At every 'woman' moment there is a need for a new 'woman' key character, guess the GENDER? Yes 'woman' WOMAN!!!!All of this is very tedious.... (Boring).1000
I don't know the books, but I highly doubt it will be like this... The second season is going to be BORING!!",IMDB,TEDIOUS FOR A REASON....,8.0
"Remembrance of Earth's Past might be, if not my favorite book series, on the top three. When I've heard they were adapting it for Netflix, I was scared. When I've heard who was behind the project, I was even more scared. But, on the same time, I was... kind of hopeful? Sure, we had the Tecent adaptation... The news about the cast and and the teasers left me even more fearful.I did get hopeful from time to time, like when I heard they were calling the others ""San-Ti"" and now ""Treesolarians"", showing they went back to the original language books.I was right to be scared, and I was right to be hopeful.The adaptation if good, but good in a very different way the books are good.It is the same story (mostly), and they are being faithful to it (mostly). It can't compete with the books regarding the science, but it is good where the books are weak (character development).The casting works. Liam Cunningham is going a great job. Marlo Kelly is perfectly cast. Benedict Wong is spot on. Everyone else is going a competent job at the very least.The pacing is faster than the books but, then again, how could it not be. But not so fast that they don't take their time to show us the characters.Even having had the books and knowing the story, it is worth the watch. Not only as an adaptation but, mostly, by itself.",IMDB,A different kind of good compared to the books,7.0
"I'm only two episodes in so bear with me, but the thing I've noticed so much is the smoking. There seems so much of it at a time where in the UK less than 20% of the population smokes, much lower the younger you are, and definitely not in any type of workplace. It makes London feel quite Sandmanish. Apart from that I agree that the main character seems unable to express real emotions other than a uniform aggrieved look. I will continue to watch as I have been drawn in a bit, the video game does seem an interesting addition to the plot, and clearly a winking universe has some value, but I'm still going to guess that the average cigarette lighting per episode will continue at a mark of four plus.",IMDB,Alternative earth with super smokers.,8.0
"I am a Chinese and I read the novels in my college years about 15 years ago. Well let's be straight this is not for you if you can't stand any deviations being made in a TV show adapted from books. However, I found myself quite enjoying the watching although at the very two episodes it was a bit challenging to know who is WHO, which became clear after 3 episodes.Let's admit it there would be no way to properly make someone feel exactly how they felt the first time they read a great novel (TLOTR is one great exception here, Long Live Saint Peter). This Netflix version, however, is NOT BAD. The way it connects the characters can be a little bit too intentional but it's not a bad adoption. I like seeing how they improved the chemistry between Chen Xin and Yun Tian Ming and their story in season one here is one of the highlights.All I want to say is I am OK with adaption so long it make sense logically. In this case, Netflix version did a good job.",IMDB,Okay it's not bad,6.0
"The moment I heard Netflix was doing a version. I was so excited as the book blew my mind. Probably one of the best books I have ever read.I discovered by accident the Chinese version and bought it just before the Netflix version came out.Visually the Netflix version was amazing, but the story lacked. The actors were not great, the east Asian actors were much better.The story is rushed with no depth or understanding, leaving those who haven't read the book or watched the Chinese version, hearing the bare bones of a truly epic story.It's seems more money making and batardises the essence of what this story is truly about.Disappointing. This would have been Netflixes crowning glory.Oh well.",IMDB,"Visually pleasing, but thats it. Rushed and missing the point.",1.0
"When I saw the trailer I was like oh wow this looks amazing! We're gonna see an alien invasion and time travel, things that will blow my mind and make me think. But instead what I saw was an unimaginably boring 8 episodes with no action except for a few minutes in one episode. No aliens, no action, nothing that made me think real hard or that boggled my mind. I would have turned it off long time ago but someone else wanted to watch it so it was on and I just couldn't believe how boring it was. Almost as boring was watching paint dry, no joke. Now I don't anything about the book, I only know what I saw in the trailer and whoever put that trailer together is a incredible because he took the dullest most boring show I've ever seen and made it look amazing.I am so so disappointed. What was this? What was the point?I hope there is never another awful show like this again.But for those who enjoyed it, I'm happy for you.",IMDB,I Am Beyond Disappointed!,8.0
"Been fan of sci-fi series for a long time and this series comes as a pleasant surprise. And since it is a book adaption, surely there have been critics about its adaption especially when they did some westernization with characters and other things but as a watchers who didn't have a clue about the books, the series is splendid.Don't care if the book does certain things better, I didn't disappoint with the series. Surely it takes time but all things are justified with the answers given in an amazingly delivered ep.The choice of using western characters to replace chinese characters make sense if you appeal to a wider audience. And the cast did a great job.The direction is spot on. The visuals are gorgeous and scary tbh. And certain characters are well written and the actors performed them well like Wade, Shi, and Wenjie etc.I am excited for its return and looking forward to an impossible solution of 3-body problem.",IMDB,The sci-fi done right,9.0
"I never read the books or even heard of this story until it came on Netflix and even after watching the trailers, I was confused on what the story should be. But, it looked intriguing so my family and I decided to check it out. I'm so glad we did. The storyline is compelling and unique and the graphics are nothing short of amazing. We love science fiction and this show does a good job of blending sci-fi with human drama and intimate personal relationships. The acting is solid. The only critique I have is that physicists who look like supermodels is not that believable but this is TV so it's to be expected. The international cast is nice to see and we can't wait to see what the next season brings.",IMDB,Unique and compelling,6.0
"The classic idea that aliens are invading the earth is put to the test in the modern era of physics series. The concentration on physic theory is mediocre but the collision with anti-physic movement in 1960s is well played. How does this lead to a alien invasion? Well, it turns out to be a rebellion against humanity by a victimized physisist of the anti-physic movements. The communication with a alien intelligence occurs and once they learn of our co-existence, they create a push to invade. It's that simple but there is a catch to the equation. The Aleins will take 400 years of space travel to reach Earth. Once it's conceived by human society, the series just feels dumber. 400 years later...etc.",IMDB,Interesting Alien Concept,9.0
"Not an exact copy of the book. The program has more space for the interpersonal relationships adding depth to the characters that together look like a scene from Friends.I also liked the scientific accuracy, the mix of fast and slow pace, and perhaps the most important of all is that they don't assume the viewer is stupid.On the downside there are a lot of graphic scenes,
the alien (ai) behavior reminded me very much of behavior of people on the spectrum. And I feel insulted from the association with bad/evil/scare.This is a surprise because otherwise they have put so much effort to make the cast diverse.",IMDB,Friends fighting aliens,6.0
"Having watched the whole of season 1 will I be eagerly awaiting season 2? Probably not. Acting is above average and effects are good but the story hasn't grabbed me and the logic and ""science"" behind the storyline is somewhat flawed.For example how are 300 nuclear devices suspended in space in a stable line awaiting detonation and since the detonations appear to do close how does the first not knock the latter ones out of position. Also with the heatsets provided by the aliens, where are they made since the technology is hundreds of years in advance of earth's. If they are made by the aliens how did they travel 4000 lights years from the alien planet in the 50 odd years since first contact?",IMDB,Alright but not brilliant,8.0
"Just finished watching it and since the first episode I had these positive vibes that we are going to have a good series which we might really ""like"" and it did capture our inner sci-fi senses.The whole series with all the characters are really good even the last launching to meet the aliens mechanism can be logical in the sci-fi field and to be honest I did not find one episode that I did not like which is usually the case you have 8 episodes and you get one or even two that you say it was not related.My probably the problem with it was the ending which definitely needs a season 2 and even 3 and honestly I can't wait to watch season 2 just to see how they would cross the 400 years mark and meet the aliens it is kind of complicated but worth it.Go watch if you haven't already did.",IMDB,Season 2 is a must,6.0
"The beginning of the series draws viewers in with its intriguing plot, rich world-building, and strong character development. The sci-fi elements are intriguing, and the mysteries surrounding the titular ""3 Body Problem"" keep audiences engaged and eager to learn more. However, as the series progresses into its second half, it begins to unravel. The pacing slows down significantly, and the narrative becomes increasingly convoluted and difficult to follow. Characters like auggie become very difficult to watch. Alongwith irritating romance arc of will and jin. Still couldnt understand the reason of killing of followers of San-TI over the ship,Many of who were children.

"Let me just start with clarifying that I have not read the books so I don't know if it's a good adaptation but as a show it is intriguing. While I have issues with some characters feeling lacking and the way they did things had me left wanting more tension overall there's a curiousity in me to know more.Now to me Episode 1-3 felt like an introduction... long one but I guess they needed that setup. It can get a bit dull even though some scenes had me wide eyed. Episode 4 is the start of the hook and episode 5 reels you in... so if you're thinking about the show I suggest to push through til episode 5 and if you didn't like what it wants to show then drop it.Shout out to those who made the title sequence because I love it.

Will watch the 2nd season and rope that the series come back to another direction.Netflix put some of the dark palette of black mirror but I think the series need more colors, something different of the traditional formula and algorithmic of Netflix.The show runners could have more courage, trust in the story and be confident to run each episode with a lower velocity to give us time to absorb the content.

"I love science fiction and I was excited about this series after the first episode (I didn't read the books that it is based on). The premise seemed exciting and the story felt like it was going to be smart. However, from the third episode on, it felt like the producers were just filling time and had to meet their contractual obligations to deliver the streaming service an eight episode show whether the story required it or not. For example of the fluff, there is a scene where one of the characters takes a bath...we get to see her get into the tub and we watch her think and think about her angst for a really longtime...it's already been pounded into out heads a dozen times that she has angst...unnecessary streaming series fluff!

"Honestly, you would be a lot better off reading the books. I am never one to really compare books to screen adaptations since I believe they both have their strengths but in this case, a lot of changes were unnecessary and cause a lot of disconnect in the plot. This ultimately causes disconnect for the viewer.The first two books of the series are written in chronological order while the last book includes events that occur simultaneously during the events of the first two books. The series attempts to mesh some of these events within the plot but it doesn't work out well & leaves holes. It also attempts to tie characters together who never really even have ties when these events occur. With these holes and extra connections come explanations that you don't get and the inability understand the depth of the situations. It would have been better to keep those stories on a separate storyline track without initially forcing the characters and storylines when there was no direct connection in the beginning.The series also takes some liberties by adding in characters and veering from the source material in order to add more ""Hollywood action"". Some of that has to do with a character who can incidentally wipe herself off security footage and become ""invisible"" in order to kill those deemed as a threat. It is over-the-top and actually takes away from the story. There are many great plot points that involve action and twists and adding this type of villainous character who isn't really needed to advance the plot takes away from the brilliance this show could be.Character portrayals take away character depth and motivations that are important to the plot, especially with how earlier actions affect future ones. It's very hard to see how those connections will be made and how it will have such a big impact on the viewer as it does in the book.To be quite fair, the book is very science-based, so much so that it is logical to such a point that you could truly envision most of the events occurring as they are presented. It's clear the author took care in this aspect of trying to portray this idea in such a realistic way that you would not question the science but consider the possibilities. The series would be better off this way as well, especially with considering that even if its audience does not have PhDs in Physics, it does have a brain and can understand the information once presented.All in all, if you're looking for something to watch, it's a nice watch if you're not thinking too much and want to have fun. If you're looking to be thoroughly entertained, challenged, engaged, and overall wowed by an awesome plot, character development, and sci-fi ideas, immerse yourself in the series by Cixin Liu!",IMDB,Read the Book,7.0
"Straight of the bat, there as some inconsistencies with the story, such as with the time periods and certain character placements within those periods but beyond that, the series is rather palpable in that regard. Oh, and expect to ignore the ""science"" in this show, because it makes almost zero sense... Perhaps that's intentional given the story... It's quite off putting when the physics of the show is literally contrary to how modern physics depicts it with literally no explanation as to why. You need a great suspension of disbelief to enjoy the show, particularly with how the Sun works.The only other criticism I could muster is that some characters suffer from being 2 dimensional, showing little to no deviation in their portrayal of said characters. It's not a train smash but I did find my self skipping those scenes but it was quite boring and detracting from what was an otherwise thrilling watch.I only wish the series took the liberty of expanding upon the story with what the Russian and American scientists initially discovered and their reaction to the discovery too. Since it wasn't just an exclusive broadcast to China.",IMDB,"Intriguing, very intriguing.",8.0
"Short review: The series are ok, but feels rushed, reduced to a bunch of characters that know each other and to (mostly) a single place on earth. Entertaining, good sci fi ideas, but feels otherwise shallow and small.Long version: Here, we got the trilogy of the scifi chinese novels ""The Three Body Problem"" as a foundation and core ideas of the plot. I read the back half a decade ago, so I had forgotten lots of it, and I saw the series almost as a newcomer to it.I won't spoil plot details, but it is well known the story deals with a future alien threat for humanity. That core idea, and most of the responses to it and the scifi concepts from the book are brought pretty well to the series. And they are done in an entertaining way. All good so far.Now, the problem of the series falls in other areas like the scale, the pace and the characters/casting. All of them, I get the feeling, from a lack of budget.Scale: Remember the magnitude and the feeling of ""epic"" scale scifi tv series like Battlestar Galactica or V ? Where everything was a stake? Where multiple characters from different parts wouldn't meet each other for seasons? That's lost here: 90% of the series happens in London/around London, and it is shot in a way that often feels more like a soap opera than a sci series. The same establishing shots all the time, mostly indoors, barely any extras, when outdoors just small streets. They might as well been shooting in a stage. The book involved a lot more travelling, things happening in parallel in US/Europe/China; giving us an adventure feeling and a bigger scale to it.Pace: most of other series are filled with stuff to drag them longer. This one isn't. But not in a good way that would make the show lean and smooth. In this case just feels like a lack of patience and budget to explain or show things, to know our characters, to let it grow on you: scenes are unconnected, characters jump from emotion to emotion without continuity, stuff just seem to happen. There isn't much character development, there isn't much tension, there isn't any mystery.Characters: truly the novels just had the 3-4 main charactera developed, while the secondary characters were more stereotypes without much deep. The tv series doesn't get much better. It mades things worse by making the main characters old classmates, and losing the more independent timelines and stories that would eventually cross each other in more epic shows.The story could've been slightly slower, with more emphasis on the characters and build the tension and mystery. Things, events and characters should've been given more distance, giving us more scale and variety/diversity of POV and environments. The only exception to this was the flashback storyline in the first 2 episodes, that feels a whole different level and was clearly done with care. Netflix, however, wasn't as confident on the IP's success and didn't made it was well as this could've been. I wonder if that will eventually mean its own demise. Sad. This one could've been great.",IMDB,A bit disappointing... feels like Netflix didn't have faith in the series,6.0

"I think that this series has a distinct, non-vulgar story with a factor of mystery and suspense, and it could have been much better than this had it not been for its poor implementation in terms of directing, writing dialogues, and events. I liked the diversity of languages, cultures, and races in this series, and I also liked the merging of realistic science with science fiction, which... It is considered an attractive idea, and they succeeded in combining them together, in addition to moving to the past and representing past events with a wonderful science fiction element. I also liked the characters of Soul Durand, Jack Rooney, Will, and Jin Cheng. This is in addition to good acting, wonderful photography, and very convincing CGI. There is some good comedy for the series and some symbolism For Oppenheimer's film, despite all these advantages, this series is full of many defects that spoil its story. The first of these defects is that some of the dialogues and conversations are boring and do not add any value or depth to the story. There is also the introduction of political agendas in a disgusting way, in addition of the presence of clear writing gaps and laziness. In writing the events and sequences of the story in a convincing way, such as shots of conclusion, analysis, and spying on the main characters without any evidence and without any preparation for these shots. Also, one of the drawbacks of this series is that the character of Auggie is an unpleasant, provocative, petty, and domineering character. I literally hated her appearance and shots. I could not sympathize with her. I was hoping it would end her scene fastly, in addition to the severe weakness in building some of the main characters of the series without adding any depth to these characters, such as the character of Mike Evans, who has illogical and unconvincing motives, as well as Detective Da Shi, who did not appear outside of his work except in literally two shots, while the rest of the series only worked as if he were a secondary character. On the side, there are no logical reasons for some of the events of the series, such as the reason for the Chinese army's attempt to communicate with aliens instead of developing weapons to fight the capitalists, and such as the reason for Yi Wenji's confidence in the San Ti Ren to this degree, and that they are the salvation of humanity, even though they described humans as insects and were the cause of the death of her daughter and her lover. Another disadvantage is that there are bad and very weak triangle love with no emotional addition to the series and very repeatative stories. As for the end of the first part to say the least, it is very unconvincing and bad and did not motivate me at all for the second part.",IMDB,A good story with very poor direction and writing,6.0

An excellent and diverse cast adds even more quality to the series. I highly recommend to anyone who loves sci-fi to watch this series with an open mind and be prepared to be surprised.

"Alright, the film is entertaining, packed with logical fallacies. They argue that Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf don't comprehend lying, while in the previous scene, they accuse the two scientists of lying, who are then dissected. If they grasp quantum elementary particles to such an extent, they could easily resolve the three-body problem, for if there's a stable period, they could transform the two stars into white dwarfs or other celestial bodies. Gravitational anomalies would cease to exist, and stars wouldn't utilize each other as slingshots. Admittedly, the functioning of the solar system likely required the other two stars, but with such knowledge, they would surely have resolved this issue as well. How certain are they that our planet suits them? They assert it's entirely different.

"The plot has been simplified too much, skipping many developments, and the pace is too fast, leaving many areas unclearly explained. There's a lack of the gradual unfolding of the story that brings a sense of surprise. Liu Cixin's original work, especially the first part, focused heavily on character development, particularly Ye Wenjie, who throughout the entire book becomes too one-dimensional. Her emotions should be complex, and there should be differences in psychology between her youth and old age. The characters all feel too flat. However, Yun Tianming's adaptation is decent, and the actor's performance is excellent. The visual effects, especially the cosmic scenes, which were highly anticipated, lack the necessary impact. On the bright side, the gaming and dehydration aspects are satisfying, reminiscent of how I imagined them while reading. Overall, it's okay, but it's just that it's been simplified too much compared to the original.",IMDB,"Overly simplistic, hopefully the second one will be better",8.0
The first few episodes might not be too fast paced but it does get really good once the story line kicks in. I do not waste my time writing reviews for avg. Shows but this is way beyond avg.

Haven't read the books so no idea how it all ends but I am super curious to find out!!I can totally recommend the show to sci-fi lovers and I recommend to ignore the negative reviews especially the ones stating it's not realistic.... It's a show about an alien invasion... so of course it's not gonna be realistic....

The only disappointment is, that I have to watch future seasons to see how it ends.The most appealing part are the religious connotations which you notice, if you watch carefully.

The 3-body civilization would not have to reveal themselives to earth and perfectly sovled the 3-body system chaotic problem and remain silent for dark forest law.

The characters are absolutely believable and very-well cast.I love how they worked in connected particle ideas for being able to spy on us from more than 400 light years away.And there's that absolutely fascinating idea about how one race might attempt to solve its own existential problems at the expense of another race, and how that might play out in the REAL universe. I loved the other race using a VR game to explain to us why they had to invade our planet, as if this would make it all ok.I also loved the invaders informing us they were coming at nearly the speed of light and would be here in 400 yrs.So perfectly Asimovian!",IMDB,"If you ""got"" Asimov you'll like this!",9.0

"This genre shouldn't be compared to something like breaking bad or the GOT. Those are fun movies, but here you have a connection between the science and the drama, so it might not be up to your taste if you focus on drama, action, ...
if you are like me, have a logical mind more than emotional one. This gives you goosebumps then it\s an amazing series that I hope it continue to an end!I do agree that the location could be more diverse and interesting, as it seems a lot of recording in UK with people in American ascent. Also the CGI could be much better.On the other hand the speed of the story is good, but with slowing down on the less interesting parts. I believe the story can be a bit slower when you are showing a depth of the interaction with the other side, not the long shots on the beach and small gatherings that were not made interesting in the episodes.However the rating does not seem fair, that's why I gave it a full 10, as we need to support these kind of productions rather than the ones that you only see to amuse yourself and don't think!Keep up the good work.",IMDB,Amazing!,10.0
"I didn't read the books. But I tuned in for this show, and I really enjoyed it!The plot is layered and has intelligent dialogue. I love the type of stories that can take the concept of ""First Contact with Aliens"" seriously. There's plenty of things in this plot that hadn't seen before in the genera.There were a couple of plot holes and some things I didn't think made sense.

"A great story/premise ruined by incredibly annoying characters, bad casting, writing and and poor execution.Knew nothing of the books or basic story when starting and it's quite slow to get going - however, it's possibly the first modern portrayal of 1960's China on a mainstream platform showing a glimpse of the Communist regime that murdered approximately 60 million of it's own people making the Nazis look like amateurs... That won't go down well in the Western education establishments... so good on them for doing so - probably didn't realise they weren't adhering to the playbook. What next, a Che Guevara expose? That'll ruin the T-Shirt sales.Once it does gain momentum, the story rolls along quite nicely but your enjoyment is broken on a regular basis by the now usual 'strong independent woman' basically being a royal pain in the backside, having a tantrum while smudging their makeup just enough to show their vulnerability. Most of the blokes are written as idiots, so normal jogging there.I'd seen that compared the books, the main hero was originally a guy, but this show deemed it necessary to split that into a two female role - both annoying - can't work out who it insults more, women as it takes two of them to match a single fella or the audience who they think can't follow the depth of a more complex character. Regardless, it detracted from the plot and frankly, given the direction of travel of the human race, extermination isn't such a bad option perhaps.I'm going to try and look up the Chinese version - can't be worse.",IMDB,"5 Stars for the story, one for the rest",6.0
"If you're a fan of Liu Cixin's book, you'd appreciate the accurate thrill and fear of aliens, not only their plight, issues and the familiarity of another life form's struggle. But also lays bare the threat of the ""Dark Forest"" theory which outlines the potential danger of a highly advanced species finding out about a less primitive species.Much like how European colonizers treated less advanced people's they came across by oppressing and wiping them out. This point is also brought out by how we treat bugs or less intelligent species on our own planet, we never bat and eye about killing cockroaches or flies everyday, which is a perfect metaphor for how the aliens view us.Lastly not to reveal too much, I'm glad they tried to follow real science as much as possible.",IMDB,A fantastic adoption of the book series,8.0
"Intriguing, emotive and at times captivating. I found my involvement and empathy for most of the characters quite high. There are flaws, both logical and emotional but it is thought provoking. It was en entertaining and worthwhile watch. I am sure what I found to be miscues, others will not, so I won't voice much of my criticism, it's the story dammit! I am familiar with science concepts and quantum phenomena, also I am on a spiritual path (aren't we all). My sense is all beings, aliens included, exist in a conscious universe/s. In my mind the goal of the game no matter at what level the ""I"" or ""Us"" is playing on is the same for all, for we are all one. My sense is that gross warfare is a game played on the lowest levels of the game and is extremely entangled in our consciousness here on earth. The killing of the ""followers"" by a hyper advanced civilization strikes me as a little off key.

By the third episode, things come together and click and you are wanting more. The actors perform their respective parts decently enough, however I do not find anyone truly sympathetic besides Dr. Ye Wenjie and the little girl in the video game.

"I really, really liked the first ~4 episodes - they were intriguing, moved at a brisk pace, and the acting was outstanding, especially Zine Tseng. The last 4 episodes were focused on human drama, and moved at a slower pace. Without sharing any spoilers, it felt like the Directors were investing in character development, and over rotated a bit. The casting was excellent across the board, with many new faces (at least for me), and this a big deal for me - The Expanse is one example of a great storyline which was a bit overshadowed by a few poor casting choices.

"The series is based on a book. I remember the book was hailed as a.great accomplishment when it appeared and I put it on my to read list. However, after looking at reviews I decided to postpone it indefinitely. Needless to say, series in Netflix is an opportunity to find out what the fuzz was all about. It begins well and I understand how the opening sequences set in China during cultural revolution might be eye opening. I am not even sure whether any of that is even taught at schools. Maybe history classes are all on intersectionality? Who knows. In any case, from there the series deteriorates rapidly. We encounter supposedly top scientists of Great Britain if not the world. I do not know whether dialogues were lifted from the book or were created for TV, but I can assure creators of the series that high IQ people do not talk like teenagers strolling through the mall in buggy pants and do not have emotional problems lifted from Friends. I also hate to break it to TC ""creators"", but smoking weed is not top pastime at CERN. The reason is prosaic, it is rather difficult for a stoned person to engage in modern physics. I suspect that operating a lift fork would be a challenge, but operating a cyclotron certainly is.At this point I actually stopped watching, but after few days I decided to ignore physicists cum deadheads licencia poetica and continue. That was a mistake. It became quite obvious that the whole story was conceived by teenagers and caters to younger viewers who still find the world of computer games more engaging than the actual world. Why highly advance alien civilization would use VR game to communicate information about their native world that could have been communicated within a brief paragraph? Note they are so advanced they have no problem typing in Chinese or Cyrillic. They can wrap half of the Universe into a single proton but their invasion plan is to hire Manson Family. I will be merciful and I will skip the soggy drama of terminal disease, which was probably added as in teenage mind it looks profound. No, it is merely.sentimental and wastes valuable screen time that could be otherwise use to clarify many plot holes.Finally a warning. There are open ended plot lines. Given the quality of script writing it might have been by neglect, but what worries me is that a sequel might be in the making.",IMDB,By teenagers for teenagers.,5.0
"I'm a huge fan of the books, and I had really low expectations going in because of how bad the trailers were. However, I could not turn this off! I watch it all in a day! So good! , I was really pleased that they managed to get the overall story and message from the book across. The acting was ok and the special effects were inconsistent and sometimes great, but I'm just happy I got to see judgment day and other jaw-dropping revelations from the books on screen. I like the books and the series deliver the story, sure its simplified, but the books are sometimes hard to deliver. Hoping Dark Forest gets greenlit, that's where the story gets life changing.",IMDB,I couldn't stop watching!,10.0
"The trailer had me so hyped I binge-read the first two books just before the show dropped. Then I realized there was stuff in this season - early in the season - that either was a wild addition to the story or came from the third book. Sure enough, I started reading the third book before I finished the season and it was all there. I felt like there should have been a spoiler-warning for all the books in the series for the first season alone. Other than that, I liked the show. The narrative is easier to follow, but that's not always an accolade. The science in the book is dense, but fascinating. The show skims the surface of the hard science fiction of the books.

"I'm thru episode 1 and part way thru 2. I felt the need to jump on this and comment.Everything is very much on point. Except one excruciatingly annoying aspect. The character Auggie Salazar, she needs to take a happy pill and quit being such a B. Every time, and I mean every time another character engages with her she gives them the cold shoulder. Even if she invites someone to come see her. She'll act like they are a nuisance and wishes they weren't there bothering her. It's old and played out at this point. I really hope the director changes that as I proceed.I don't know if it's bad acting or the inability to act and have any depth so she does the only thing she knows how to do - act like B. Like those kids in school that hated when a teacher called on them or tried joking around to lighten up the mood. The kid is shy, but instead acts out because that's all he knows. Well I'm not seeing any acting ability in her part at all. It's like B-level horror movie acting with the damsel as the lead. No substance. Just pretty screams and stupid attempts at having emotionsI'd consider two more stars if that were minimized at this point but B-force is strong with this one.",IMDB,Auggie needs to lighten up,6.0
"Probably, the first TV-show for me to really hammered down the feeling of alienation. The next science-fiction after The Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and Interstellar to be the pinnacle of the decade outer space exploration. And for the comparison, 3 Body Problem might just be the most faithfully detailed, science-oriented out of the three!Utilizing the length from its long episodic formation, this Interstellar shuttle admittedly won't launch with the flashiest exhaust at first, but burn slowly as it introducing the main circle of character, and getting us warm with how cold and distance the humanity are in this. But as soon as you get through the first two episodes, the trajectory of this unknown voyage would be as clear as the mystery of the vast night sky! As it's captured your curiosity on how alienated but familiar the whole concept is. It's as complicated as a quantum science could be, but not too proud or so distant that you can't wrap your head around it.As long as you can adapt your eyes on how allergic to colors the tone is, or how muddy sometimes the visual effects are, you'll be in a slow, but scenic ride with a lot to take for, while heading towards the proper, Secret Invasion!",IMDB,It takes the creators of Game Of Thrones to do the story of Secret Invasion justice.

"Overall the series deliver solid entertainment. I've read the books, watched the Chinese adaptation and did not expect the Netflix series to completely align with the book as the material is quite extensive. The books are one of the best in the sci-fi genre, I highly recommend reading them. The Netflix series manages to capture the essence of the books, however in a much watered down version. In my opinion a few more episodes could have been added to extend the storyline.I understand the reasoning behind the character changes which work fairly well in most cases and thus might appeal to a wider audience. Some of the actors are spot on, including Ye Wenjie, Da Shi, Jin Cheng and Thomas Wade. Unfortunately Auggie Salazar is totally off for me. She's supposed to be a top scientist but the over the top acting completely ruins the believability of the character. I could not relate to her at all and was impatiently waiting for her scenes to end. Too bad, as the rest of the cast works well together and delivers a smooth performance.The special effects are well done and enhance the storytelling which is big plus these days. The music was a bit of a letdown for me, nothing memorable here; in comparison, the Chinese adaptation has excellent music choices.I do recommend watching the series but don't expect it to be as scientifically engaging as the books.",IMDB,Captures the essence of the books,8.0
"For once more, the fabulous D & D duet take certain liberties in their adaption of a renowned literary accomplishment, and if you take in account how things ended with Game of Thrones, then you shouldn't be overtly optimistic for the outcome of this one.I wasn't a big fan of the first two books -my mind changed with the third which I'm currently reading. I'm not sure if it was the translation or the writing style, I struggled to finish the first-the second was slightly better. I'm not a big fan of hard science. I always felt that Arthur Clarke did the same thing in a better manner in Childhood's End.The Netflix show polishes the rough edges and simplifies the whole thing, adding lots of gory scenes to make the show appeal to a younger and less sophisticated audience. Not necessarily a bad thing if you want to target the average viewer rather than the hardcore science fiction fans of the original trilogy.The Netflix show feels very rushed, by the time you reach episode six you're already in the third book, but hey, these are the guys who adapted Game of Thrones, so no suprise there.There is lots of visual excitement, but lots of scenes, such as the destruction of the ship and its passenger, feel like they belong to another film. The characters are also kinda lame. The ""Oxford 5"" were a bad idea better suited for the Final Destination franchise.After I finished the Netflix show, I started watching the Chinese version and I couldn't believe my eyes. Science fiction done on a level that has never been done before, with an amazing visual style much better than any Netflix or HBO show.

"I have read books and the Chinese TV version series, and the speed and rewriting is OK for me. They have the soul of the book. The biggest problem is that many important concepts in the original book have not been explained in detail ,such as quantum entanglement. We can stop and Google while reading , but not when watching TV. Also concept like ""Technology lock"" If the play spend an extra 30 seconds explaining each concept, it would be much better.

"I'm going to start this review by saying I know this isn't really an adaptation for those who are fans of the book and that's perfectly fine, And for those who haven't read the book or watched the Chinese version it's a serviceable show. As for those like me who've read the book and/or watched the Chinese adaptation it feels super rushed going from one story beat to another at the drop of a hat. A lot of the Character interactions and tension is just not there since the show moves way too fast for its own good.If you liked this show and want more 3 body I would recommend Chinese version, It's more faithful to the book but most importantly it gives the characters time to develop and the science aspect is more explored.

"If you enjoy the series, do NOT read the books. It will forever taint the fondness you have for the adaptation.If you read the books, be prepared to be disappointed. They've made so much detrimental and unnecessary changes to the source materials often at the spirit and core of the books.They've truncated a lot of the main characters by merging several characters into one. Naturally, we have the usual hollywood race and gender swap. Some of the roles and plots doesn't appear until the later books all got mashed together in one season and one character.The worst transgression is: The trilogy was always about the bigger picture and have equal focus on the science and the characters. This adaptation put way too much emphasis on the characters as if it was GOT or the walking dead when it's a completely different theme and scope.There are already enough complexity in the plot with the science, but they thought it was a good idea to unnecessary add teenage high school like drama to the adaptation.Take for example, Salazar. One of the worst written character in recent history. Always emotional, to the point of threatening physical violence to one of her friend's jabs. And she was supposed to be a brilliant scientist, just watch her and ask yourself when is the last time you see ANY female scientist irl talk like her and as emotionally unstable as her?After watching this series I'm convinced D&D is incapable of writing anything good by themselves and only get carried by the works of others with genuine brilliance.",IMDB,Ignorance is bliss,4.0
"Three Body Problem on Netflix has more DNA from Jonathan Nolan's HBO Westworld than any other series I know of. Even tho I loved Jonathan Nolan's Person of Interest series, I did not care for the Westworld series. Why? It seemed pretentious; and, its narrative was disjointed to no benefit for viewers. These are typical signs of a project which has some good ideas and a big bugget; and yet, no deeply held conviction nor point of view.1899 (2022) was an expensive Netflix flop. It basically repeated the same errors as Westworld.Three Body Problem on Netflix has learned from Westworld and 1899 and corrects these exact errors. Thanks to the author Cixin Liu, the seemingly separate, disjointed storylines of the original novel can and do come together into a coherent whole. Success. It's very watchable.2) A second big problem Netflix's Three Body Problem solves is the problem of Asian actors having insufficient emotional range and nuance to engage Western audiences. Have you noticed this? Many not all Japanese, Korean and especially Chinese movies and actors have no problem with anger, grief and sadness. However more nuanced emotions between and above these basic emotions often escape them. This review is not the place to compare-contrast the strengths and weaknesses of Eastern and Western European cultures.Suffice it to say, ALL the leads in Three Body Problem do express a range of emotional nuance Western which can and does engage Western audiences. We even have two actors playing against type. BD Wong a hero in Marvel's Dr. Strange, plays a shlubby detective. BD has always had good range; he fits into this part very well. John Bradley, who played the comical conspiracy theorist 1899 (2022) was an expensive Netflix flop.

"The ""3 Body Problem"" series on Netflix, based on Liu Cixin's Hugo Award-winning novel, is a grand science fiction saga that weaves together stories from different timelines. It kicks off with the historical backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, introducing us to Ye Wenjie, who, after witnessing her father's tragic death, ends up working at a secret SETI research station. In parallel, the series unfolds in the modern timeline, where a group of scientists grapples with unexplained phenomena and suicides among their ranks, hinting at a profound and unsettling mystery tied to an extraterrestrial message Ye Wenjie responds to, setting off a chain of events that spans decades.The show, brought to life by ""Game of Thrones"" creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, along with Alexander Woo, features a diverse and intriguing cast, including Eiza González, Benedict Wong, and Jovan Adepo, among others. It delves into themes of humanity, civilization, and the universe, exploring the complexities of contact with an alien civilization known as the Trisolarans. The narrative is rich with scientific concepts, existential threats, and philosophical dilemmas, providing a compelling watch for sci-fi enthusiasts.The reception of ""3 Body Problem"" has been generally favorable, with Rotten Tomatoes reporting a 77% approval rating and Metacritic giving it a score of 70, indicating generally favorable reviews.

The first espisodes are like super cool and different to the rest of stuff I have seen so it actually catch my attention and I couldn't resist to watch the next episode.

It would just been better to end the serie earlier.Now I don't care to see the next season but eventually if I'm watching it I hope it is going to be more consistent and they would put attention not only to the first episodes in order to generate hype and hoping the audience will watch the entire season no matter how bad the rest is because it is not happening again.,IMDB,Couldn't maintain the quality,6.0

For the first three episodes the writing was pretty tight, though it continued to move rather slowly. The next two episodes were pretty poor as the writers got lazy. In addition to introducing some pretty big plot holes, they also decided it was time for some melodrama. By episode six, there was no holding back. The writing got so bad it was almost comical. More melodrama, more and bigger plot holes, and just plain nonsense. This pattern continued until the end of the season, which gave us a finale that did absolutely nothing.

It's kind of fun to see some of the more high-concept elements played out on the screen, but honestly, it was better in my head.I also don't like how they felt the need to make the main characters more relatable by making them equivalent to university third years. It felt kind of cheap, and the writing is very cringeworthy. The humour had no place in the books due to the subject matter, and to be honest it has no place here.Again, another example as to why 99% of adaptations just don't work.Netflix just never learns.Avoid, and do yourself a favour and read the books instead.

I know that the trilogy has a lot of fans, but I thought it was some sort of a fluke.When I heard that Benioff & Weiss were adapting the books for a Netflix series, I thought that maybe I missed something in the books and given that I was a big fan of Game of Thrones series (and, actually, not that big fans of the books), I thought they might pull off a strong series even if the source material was 'meh'.Well, watched three episodes and had to conclude that this is simply bad - unbelievable plot, unbelievable characters, slow pace, zero empathy to anyone and anything happening on the screen - basically, everything that could go wrong did go wrong here.

"Translating the series to screen was a difficult task, but the show is faithful to the events of the books while making appropriate modifications to fit the medium.The primary protagonists are now contemporaries and friends in an interwoven plot line. We see great progress in telling the stories of Ye Wenjie, the Three-Body game, the staircase project, and the introduction of wallfacers and hibernation.Many other modifications are very sensible - Ye's principles of cosmic sociology have been replaced with metaphor. The game narrator / sophons are personified. The legacy of the ETO is embodied by original character Tatiana, enabling behavior motivations distinct from Ye and Evans.Alas, the best remains ahead, as the series proceeds into the terrors of The Dark Forest, and the bizarre reaches imagined in Death's End. We can only hope Netflix continues their investment for one more season to ensure we get to see it.",IMDB,Successful adaptation of an excellent trilogy,6.0
"I read the original so obviously they bias my opinion. In the case of Avatar: The Last Airbender, I thought their choices where good. But, in the case of 3 Body Problem I'm not quite feeling it.For the first 5 episodes I was loving it. I had no issues with the changes in characters nor how they squeezed things to fit into the shorter time. But, from episode 5 on it just went downhill for me. The changes didn't seem like they added to the story or add to it. Rather they seemed like poor writing and bad ideas being jammed into the story with cliched scenes and responces. It started turning into a soap opera instead of hard scifiI wanted to reach through the screen and punch the nanotech scientist who couldn't understand the stakes. I didn't buy for a second someone that smart could be that stupid. Bad writing.The lead physics expert's scenes trying to convince her dying friend to, instead of do something amazing and meaningful with his last few days should instead sit in bed suffering. Probably the single worst writing ever. How they changed what actually happens to him also seems like it's going to turn into a new fiasco since it seems unsalvageable in any believable way to its importants later.Of course I'll keep watching, but it just goes to show how in the same way the producers ruined Game of Thrones it appears likely they're going to ruin 3 Body Problem as well. I don't mind if they change it. I mind that that changes are bad.",IMDB,Goes down hill,10.0
"David Benioff and D. B. Weiss deliver a solid adaptation of The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin. I enjoyed every moment of this Masterpiece! This story is a profound meditation on the dangers of people with power who think in terms of Grand Plans. This is a worthy follow up to Game of Thrones. I am looking forward to season two. The writing is excellent, the actors give brilliant performances. I highly recommend this series. There has never been a more relavent show in 2024.Ppl need to put in mind that the book is considered a hard sci-fiction book, and nearly unadaptable, so they did a relatively good job putting together the first season. The show is not a tedious as the book is which make is watchable and more suitable for non readers. Well done.",IMDB,My new favorite epic sci-fi show!,7.0
"I haven't read the book, but I eagerly awaited the series, so I did some research on the topic and learned about it before the series aired. Firstly, I must say that I found the acting weak. While Liam Cunningham's performance was good, the rest of the acting remained mediocre. The concept excited me, and the first two episodes were promising, but the pace gradually declined afterwards. Especially, the scenes of ""Will's love"" and ""Saul's Let's smoke concept"" exhausted me, so I fast-forwarded through those parts. Two or three episodes of the series were unnecessarily devoted to ""Will,"" which was a waste. Although I couldn't get enough of Eiza Gonzalez's beauty, I couldn't grasp the image of a nanotechnology genius character, which detached me from the reality within the series. Whenever I saw Eiza, I felt again like I was watching a TV show. I expected the season finale to be more thrilling. In short, I was saddened by the wasted potential of such a beautiful concept, but if you have spare time and enjoy science fiction, it's still worth watching.",IMDB,Poor Execution of a Beautiful and Original Concept..,8.0

"Unfortunately, I can't way how far the key plot decisions in the series are from the original, though judging from other Netflix adaptations they might be quite far off. Either way, many character decisions and happenings raise questions, are inconsistent and ungrounded - which makes it hard to enjoy at times.That said, it's a good show from many perspectives: it's very well shot and put together, the CGI looks adequate and suitable, great international cast are all doing a great job (though I wish some would have more screen time), and the general premise of the series is appealing: it is, in a nutshell, a believable (yet horrifying) circumstances.I'm not sure I'd suggest it for watching, at least not yet - there's never a guarantee the show will be concluded till it is, and right now in addition to the plot issues it's far from finished.",IMDB,"Great visuals, but many questionable plot ideas",6.0

The characters in there are eminent beyond any adaptation, as they are your own creations. It is the magic stuff that cannot be replaced by any TV show or movie. So in reality, the ones reviewing based on truthfulness toward the books are pointing to something no-one can ever see; their own personal inner show.

"I haven't read the book, nor seen the Chinese series, which now I wish I had.This starts out ostensibly as a pure sci-fi piece and shows a lot of potential and promise.The premise with better than average production, direction, cinematography and finer details all make up for captivating, enchanting and curious viewing.The story begins with a series of flashbacks which set up the rest of the story: a victim of Mao's cultural revolution is recognised as a brilliant physicist and employed to work in a state of the art, top secret astronomy station, where she deduces how to amplify radio frequencies that results in a message from outer space, warning her not to respond, yet she does.The early episodes are replete with suspense, mystery and the overarching thrilling science fiction plot,which slowly reveals itself- until annoyingly, it meanders into territory exploring the sanctity of human life and love.Many of the characters, as previous reviewers have spotted, seem and feel deliberately cast by looks, tokenism and forced DEI, with the women largely playing the saviours, moral arbitrator's and ethical righteousness in the face of the war-mongering, unfeeling patriarchal establishment.Ultimately the story is about a race for survival between a distant alien species and ourselves. This forces humanity to look inwards, which is badly mishandled by the creators with the Oxford five serving as representatives of that inner search; resembling more of a soap opera than boldly exploring any existential philosophy or similar themes.They ( santi ) have already made contact and are able to recruit a small number of devotees who are dedicated to ensuring their safe arrival.Superior technology and communication is used to sabotage Earth's most cutting edge quantum physics projects and scientists in order for the santi to maintain their technological edge.A vetting process via a futuristic VA headset is used to recruit the best and brightest minds to join the small but powerful sect of followers led by Mike Evans, an entrepreneur ( Jonathan Pryce).The performances are adequate yet somewhat flat.Rosalind Chao and Jess Hong play their parts well with Benedict Wong and Liam Cunningham adding some mild humour, yet there really isn't any stand outs.The character of 'Auggie' played by Eiza González is one of the most unrealistic, irritating, repugnant and repulsive I've witnessed in awhile.Her constant pouting, tantrums and bitter solipsism makes her almost unwatchable.Coupled together with what South Park coined 'put a chick in it' serves only to detract and distract this viewer from connecting to any of the characters. She's not only unwatchable but unbelievable. Perhaps if she were twenty years older...A grave mistake was made focusing so much time on the human themes of love and value of human life when the initial premise made for much greater storytelling.It's not only trite, it assumes audiences are not able to follow a story based on hard science and philosophy of science-which should have been the main plot points, rather than the pointless wranglings about right and wrong which the protagonists keep falling into.Despite all of this series obvious flaws, it does have some interesting, redeeming moments making it a worthwhile watch.Those giving it a 10 with their ecstatic reviews And labeling those who vote down as idiots who just don't get it, fail to understand the gross mishandling of such a promising story and how frustrating that can be.In fact those who vote it down while recognising its potential probably do so with a heavy sense of disappointment and reluctant cynicism.",IMDB,Unique and promising story overshadowed by avoidable flaws,7.0
"I never want to be that person that says ""Books are still better"". But I'm being now, sorry.I love the books, they are pretty great.This show is not.Except the main essence of the plot, everything else is different.They apparently hate so much the first book that they rush past 60-70% of it in the first 3 episodes. And that is just sad.Something I don't think I ever saw in a book adaptation, is that they split the main character from the book into five people in the show. It's usually other way around. And it's done so ridiculous, they split a chinese scientist dad with a wife and a kid into a Beneton ad cliche - millenial team of a latino woman, asian woman, black man, chunky englishman and white dude with cancer. But even more bizzarely - those same characters then started to mutate into characters from the second book. I don't know what to think about it honestly.What I do know, there is no mystery, tension, thriller, only those characters, being dragged through main plot while they deal with their petty BS.You can fault chinese series for some things but they at least kept it fairly close to the first book and made an okay show, if not one a bit too long and complicated at times with some elements omited/whitewashed. But it worked.This is not that. It's worse compared to that show that came one year ago and it's far worse than the books it's ""loosely"" based on.A lot of people say Benioff/Weiss failed in finishing Game of Thrones because they had no source material to rely on so they improvised. Well they had it here and they still bungled it up. Most things are made subpar, acting, characters, plot is flatlined, even music is 10 shades of gray whatever stuff. A lot of things went unexplained or explained badly, brushed off, especially some core science stuff which play a big role in the plot. That somewhat shows what creators think about their audience.There is no sense of wonder, no amazement, no character development. It's not smart, funny, trippy or visually appealing - CGI is nothing to write home about. It's pretty lame and cliche filled affair tailored for modern western audiences that just consume and don't demand quality for their money. So, Netflix subscribers.I don't know, you can watch it, it's disappointing. You can watch chinese series, it's better, longer. But I would recommend books every time.",IMDB,How much can you deviate from source material and still call that faithful to it?,4.0

I read the book, I watched the Tencent version, I even watched a few episodes of the anime version and Minecraft version. So I don't want to read the book or some loyal adaptations over and over again. But Netflix show gives me a brand new experience. Lots of people would complain the last seasons of some TV series or reality shows are not as good as the former ones. And this happens to the book of Three Body Problem now. Some people cannot tolerate any change. Good or not, it's all the same. Three body problem tells us how big the universe is, and how small we are.

"To write my thoughts about this new Netflix series risks suffering the wrath of several friends who are huge fans of the original sci-fi novels. But alas, I love to share even if no one cares.I had such high hopes for this show and wanted to love it, but ultimately, I was pretty disappointed. I've not read the books, so can't attest to how faithful it is, but it felt like huge chunks were missing and I was forever trying to figure out WTH was going on. It's really uneven and not very engagingly written, and while the CGI is excellent and the cast ridiculously attractive (for physicists!), the pacing is slow and undetermined. The science was really interesting and I was constantly looking stuff up on Wikipedia, but by the end, I was more frustrated than anything else and will have to wait until the next season for more (perhaps).",IMDB,"A really interesting, but also terribly uneven series...",6.0
"It's actually pretty brilliant. I would even go as far as to say, flawless. It's clever, well written, the acting is superb, the score is just right, and you can just tell a lot of thought went into it.The only ones who have a problem with this masterpiece, are usual suspects: book readers who expect a faithful to the T adaptation (they could do it better, obviously), and those against diversity.Also, the really other bad thing is, THERE IS ONLY ONE SEASON!!!Hopefully Netflix will renews it very soon, so we don't have to wait too long to find out how this absolutely gripping story continues.",IMDB,"It's FANTASTIC.

"Show starts off good, it's quite gripping and makes you want to watch, but it soon starts turning into somewhat of a meme.The reason for the strong start is, in my opinion, the chinese bits of the story. They prove to be the best the show has to offer.As the show goes on we get to see more of Wade, wich is a pretty insuferable and unbeliveable character, and the cancer boy story is just cliché. The whole friend group in general doesn't prove to be a very likeable bunch for me.Also, I know they're sticking to the source, but I can't see how the plan to cut the boat in slices would ever be a good one. Can't really maintain suspension of disbelief for that one.",IMDB,"Starts out good, quickly turns sour",6.0
"Having only seen 1 pilot episode I obviously can't fully revue this show but I can see that there has been a lot of effort put into making a good adaptation of a very interesting book.I watched the chinese tv show which is slow, dark and cumbersome but intriguing nonetheless.While this adaptation is close in narrative to the books there are obvious changes made to present this to a western audience while trying to retain the heart of the story.The pace of this show is good, its not however an action fast paced sci fi extravaganza. This is a thoughtful show where the mystery and intrigue looks like it will unravel over many episodes as we follow the characters and their Discovery's.The Chinese adaptation seemed to take a few altered political narratives and doubled down on its maths and science route often lacking an emotional connection to the viewer. Whereas in the book the emotional outlook of humanity tugs at its core.Visually everything is on point and the performances where solid, even though little was revealed it flows nicely although i can see many people wanting answers it would be a disservice to the books to do so.I am looking forward to watching the entire series and how they deal with hard to adapt science and quantum physics ideologies and tie into its core human nature plot.For some this show may be a bit niche or overwhelming for others it will be not as in depth or complex as may be hoping for.8/10 for its opening.",IMDB,Faster paced than the chinese tv show,8.0

"You have to know it would be an adaptation and not entirely faithful to the book. After all, it has to have contemporary woke elements, like gender and race-swapped characters, millennials pretending to be experts, and diverse casting for a story that originally has almost all Chinese characters. And since there aren't enough key characters for Benioff and Weis, a bunch has to be created to weave more complicated character arcs.Once you choke down the initial nausea and stick with it for a couple of episodes, the main story straightens out and stays mostly on track. The China-based flashbacks that tell Ye Wenjie's story that triggers the course of events are reasonably true to source and done well, even as the London-based invented mess meanders, while Benedict Wong's character and performance is initially buried and wasted.The VR simulated world of Three Body is very well done, high budget, and it shows. By the third episode, the show begins to take better shape and redeems itself, and, at least for me, allowed me to assimilate the changes that were made to the source, and becomes watchable. I might even be able to start a drinking game to call out actors brought over from GoT.Having previously watched Tencent's 30-episode adaptation (that's far more faithful to the book), I almost would have wished that version had the same budget and treatment.

"I didn't come from reading the novel, and went in blank. And what an absolute garbage this was. It seemed liked the writers bit off more than they can chew. The plot was riddled with loopholes and the story itself wasn't aware what it wanted to portray. The major thing that stuck out to me was that if the aliens were so advanced and had sent two quantum computers to monitor the humans, then why can't they just have taken control of the world leaders instead of supporting the stupid cult. And whose idea was to put in sending 300 atomic bombs in space, are you kidding me?. I just don't understand who approved this screenplay from Netflix.

"I had been anticipating watching Netflix's 3 Body Problem. Though I haven't read the novel by Chinese author Liu Cixin, I've heard good things about it, so I wasn't concerned with reviews mentioning differences from the book. Many great TV shows are not entirely faithful to the books they are based on, such as Game of Thrones, which was adapted by the same people who made 3 Body Problem. If it weren't for watching Game of Thrones, I would never have discovered the books, and now, after seeing this show, I am interested in reading the books.I didn't know much about the book's plot, so I went in mostly blind, not knowing what to expect. It's interesting to note that this adaptation takes a British perspective. The show relies heavily on a well-written script and strong character development, creating a sense of suspense and intrigue without relying solely on large-scale alien battles and special effects. While the special effects used are impressive, the focus remains on the characters and their struggles in the face of a potential alien threat.The show effectively creates suspense through its methodical pacing and gradual reveals. The characters' inner conflicts further heighten the intrigue, leaving you always guessing what will happen next. Beyond the aliens and spaceships, the show explores the complex themes of first contact and humanity's capacity for survival in the face of an existential threat. These philosophical questions add depth to the narrative and make you think beyond the action.It took me only three nights to finish, and I was left wanting more! The story is expertly paced, leaving me eager to see how the characters navigate the coming challenges. However, Netflix has a history of cancelling shows with potential before they reach their full potential. Here's hoping they recognise the brilliance of 3 Body Problem and renew it for a second season and beyond, as I'm eager to see how the story unfolds.",IMDB,An Epic Show of Cosmic Proportions,10.0
"Netflix does not disappoint with this product. The acting and characterization is extremely well done!! There are unique nuances to interactions between different people and subtleties to look for.So right there on the ground floor they've done it right. Like Game of Thrones, the show is not shy about ending the life of a popular character to give the viewer a sense that the story could go anywhere.Story-wise, it does not disappoint. It gives you some answers with more questions as does the best Science Fiction. Through it all is this unravelling effect that compels you to watch further. There are, however, some scenes that are very disturbing. I would still rate this as one of the top Science Fiction series I've seen in the last 12 years. It's worth a look!!The good thing about this show is that it was based on a very successful book series. This is also bad for reviews because the book purists come along and say ""it's not the same as the books!! 1 Star!!"". Well it never is. I never read the books and I loved the show. Shh!!

"The title above echoes the one I gave my review of the Chinese TV series ""Three-Body,"" based on the same novel. I found both versions, Chinese and American, unwatchably stupid and eventually bailed out.The only virtues this American series has are a bigger budget and a blessedly faster pace. Plot points that took three hours (i.e., four episodes) in the Chinese version were dispensed with in the first hour of the American.The casting is ludicrous, in a typically woke Netflix way. Most absurd of all is Eiza Gonzalez, with the sculpted cheekbones and huge puffy lips of a lingerie model. Cast as a world-class nanotechnology inventor, she's a joke. Jovan Adepo plays a top quantum physicist, a potential young Einstein. Likable? Very. Believable? Never.The main problem is that almost all the characters are supposed to be genius-level science whizzes, yet all too often they talk and behave like college sophomores. And the world's other top scientists, we learn, are so irrational, so mentally fragile, that it's easy to drive them stark raving mad and eventually to suicide. All that's necessary, it turns out, is to baffle them with some unexplained visual hallucinations (""the countdown"") and to mess with the expected results of their research projects -- at which point they tear their hair out, declare that physics is dead, and proceed to off themselves. Their behavior seems ridiculous; anyone possessed of natural scientific curiosity wouldn't go this haywire when confronted with these mysterious new phenomena -- a true scientist would attempt to study and explain them. Sci-fi should be smarter than this.Some flashbacks set in Maoist China during the 1960s were handsome and packed more power than the contemporary scenes. Still, an opening Red Guard rally rang false, the huge crowd suddenly falling silent and contrite as if on cue. In another early scene, a prisoner in the Chinese equivalent of a Gulag passes a heavy hardcover book -- ""Silent Spring,"" no less -- to a woman prisoner, outdoors in broad daylight with other people around, while cautioning her not to dare let the authorities catch her with it!Since I bailed out early from this disappointing series, I've avoided giving it a star rating.",IMDB,Ludicrous casting!

Not well spent money $20 million per episode.Huge budget spent on special effects that are sometimes absolutely brilliant but sometimes look like bad sci-fi from the 90s. I don't get a luxurious feeling when I see this series that cost so much to make. It feels more like Emmerdale on steroids or like a bad British crime series.It's not bad but not $20 million per episode good.The series really balances from being an ok Sci-fi to being a single big flop. It's mostly the British feel over the whole production that bothers me. The first 8 episodes haven't been particularly tense either. Most messy and confusing.,IMDB,Emmerdale on steroids,8.0
"But still a show worth the watch and overall well done.Some characters got obnoxiously stale with the same stick up their rumps the entire season with seemingly no development or change, which you can never know on this side of the screen if it was the actors choice or the directors. Nonetheless, there were numerous brilliant and full performances from many that far out weighed the limited performances of one or two, making for a well rounded group of characters.The writing was overall good, but ironically left some pretty novice holes for someone pretentiously referring to C. S. Lewis as a terrible writer simply due to the writers nonsubtly repeated bias towards theasim.Some parts were hilariously poor planned with a good number of plot holes any half sober viewer would point out:
""Wasn't the whole point of this plan to avoid mass destruction to a ship, unlike shootin the damn thing with a missile? Well the whole thing is a flaming pile of rubble now, I guess you sure got lucky you missed slicing up the thing you didn't even know what was, and more lucky you found it""""Heli's and swat canvassing the whole area and no one sees the broad shot through the calf crawling like a snail wide out in the open?""""Same broad who seems to be their only means of assassinating anyone at any needed time across the globe, lives in a generic, unsecured, vulnerable trailer without means of immediate transportation? Why would they not set her up with a batcave of sorts.""""Fifteen plus years the judgement day cruisers have been talking to these things, they've already read half a book on fairy-tales, they've been monitoring all our activity globally, they ask more questions than a three year old, and they're JUST NOW stumbling across the concept of a lie?""I could go on and on about little overlooked lazy plot holes in the writing, and wouldn't even mention them if the writers hadn't been so obviously and obnoxiously egotistical about their own abilities and intellect. But if you're going to jab historically renowned writers of the past, you had better be at least on par with your peers of the present.They are not.But, they did adapt an engaging story from someone else's work that seems to be written well (only guessing from the compelling main plot that I assume was copy pasted from the source material).So I'm still thankful it was made.I think this is worth the watch and am looking forward to future seasons. Not looking forward to waiting. Boo hoo first world problems.But I'd really appreciate seeing the conclusion of this series before the whole world blows itself up in world War three, and I really can't be so sure anymore (he says half sarcastically through gritted teeth).So please show runners, do make haste.",IMDB,"Writers are intellectually egotistical... so, British",6.0
"Overall I am happy with the adaption. All the key scenes are there, and well presented. The actors are doing a great job. The story is more or less well paced.There are weak moments and sometimes the story drags a bit, which is a pity, given that some of the important moments of the books that would be crucial for understanding are shortened or skipped. But for most of the time the plot is well reproduced and the story telling is spot on.However, merging the characters of the book into a group of five friends was unnecessary. It renders the story implausible (why should every important event happen to these five friends from college?) and the story telling shallow (some scenes and dialogs are down there on soap opera level).I give the show a solid 6/10.",IMDB,Solid adaption ... if it wasn't for the soap opera part,8.0

The world-building is great, the cinematography is spectacular, the plot is engaging. The explanation of scientific ideas and concepts is easy to digest even to the audience not familiar with them.The scientist bunch, however... Dear scriptwriters, it's 2024. The general consensus today is that the scientists and nerds are not all insecure super geniuses who insert the F-word in every sentence to sound cool. (Thanks for not calling them ""boffins"" though.) The cast is OK but there is not much for them to play with.The cast that is given less cardboard characters like Rosalind Chao, Liam Cunningham, and in particular, Benedict Wong really shine.

"'3 body Problem' is an odd mix of great, mediocre, and sometimes frustrating. The general story, along with the arresting visuals, definitely keep you coming back for more. The ideas and concepts are catnip to any science fiction fan. The characters, on the other hand, are an entirely different ball game. Almost all of the leads are selfish, self-centred, self-righteous and often obnoxious.From what little I've read, it appears they're a major departure from the books, which I will admit I haven't read yet (Though I'm curious now). Of the 'scientists', the most interesting character is killed early on. The rest are a mix of self-absorbed narcissists, and far too controlled by their random emotions.Fate of the world at stake? Nah, I don't won't want to help, it's too much responsibility. All humans going to be eradicated? That's fine, because it's way off in the future, who cares about them? All of human civilisation and your descendants to be destroyed by heartless aliens? Well, my superior did something harsh but necessary to try and combat a seemingly unstoppable threat to all humanity, so I'm going to act morally superior and not help by spitting my dummy out.There also seems to be an obsession with Netflix (and Amazon) of having characters casually doing illicit substances all the time, as if it adds anything whatsoever to the characters or situation beyond making them feel even more weak-willed and pathetic.Of the non-scientist characters, Wade (Liam Cunningham) and Shi (Benedict Wong) are by far the most interesting. Both are struggling to get a handle on an impossible, unknown threat, and doing their best to fight it. Sometimes that means making the most horrific decisions for the greater good. That moral grey area could have made for some interesting conversations with the other leads who felt squeamish, but instead it just ends up with them being high-and-mighty and acting morally superior. Never once did anyone sit down and say ""Okay, what would you suggest? Is this terrible? Yes. Did we have a choice, fighting this enemy, given what is at stake and the odds against us?""Ultimately, it also feels a little aimless and lacklustre. The big event that this series was leading up to failed. In addition, far too much time was spent on a rather boring character leading into it. (I have little doubt that character will 'return' in season two, but at this point it makes it all feel pointless).For an introductory series, it fails to give a sense of satisfying conclusion. You can have a story where the heroes 'fail' in order to make their success all the more satisfying down the line, but when they fail so spectacularly at the first hurdle it just feels a bit pointless. Having said all that, the interesting ideas and concepts make it worth watching, and at least it wasn't superheroes...",IMDB,Story? Good. Characters? Not so much...,8.0
"Disclaimer: Not a book reader so might be missing some elaborative details
A lovely science fiction based upon the theoretical possibilities. This series deserves some background, some knowledge of physics to even understand it so basically it has very narrow viewership and it takes guts to come up with something like that. Team deserves appreciation for that.The interesting dynamics of relationship between the superior aliens (in terms of science) coming to earth to save themselves from chaotic era in their planet and Humans is so neatly presented that you can't help but wonder when the series ends on a cliff hanger.",IMDB,Gem of Science Fiction,7.0
"The pacing of the first episode is too fast.With four or five storylines running concurrently, it's a mess. If Tencent's Three-Body version is criticized for slow pacing, then Netflix's version is like rushing to catch a train, leaving no breathing space, and characters are merely pushed along by the plot. The constant switching between multiple storylines and the introduction of so many characters in the first episode would be confusing for anyone who hasn't done their homework. Even with the scientific explanations cut, I doubt Western audiences could understand what the first episode is trying to say.If the last two episodes were cut and the content of the first two episodes were expanded, the viewing experience would definitely improve significantly. Alternatively, adding two more episodes for a total of 12 might suffice, but with only eight episodes covering everything from Ye Zhetai to the Wallfacer Project, how could it not feel rushed?",IMDB,Toooo fast and chaotic,5.0
"Yes I read the books, no I don't care that they changed things. It's simply not a good show.This was created by David Benioff and DB Weiss, the two who created 4 of the greatest seasons of television and 2 of the worst (Game of Thrones). I didn't know they were in charge until a few episodes in and it really made sense once I found out. In an interview about SE6 of GoT Weiss said that he fought tooth and nail to add a pointless zombie bear scene saying ""Damn it, I want a god-damn zombie bear!"" He'd fought for several seasons until he was finally greenlit to add it. Why? Because he thought it was cool. No other reason.It very much shows that the two couldn't help themselves yet again when creating this show. The books have plenty of concrete and fascinating imagery that, to the shows credit, translate very well to the screen. However, so much of the added material is just bad and weighs down the fascinating ideas in the books.Very very minor spoilers, it's not enough that in one scene everything starts to get destroyed, but then a little girl riding a literal flaming horse bursts through a window with CGI lava pouring in behind her screaming ""save meee aaahhhh"" which genuinely made me laugh at how bad it was. It's so over the top. Of course that's the scene where my wife walks in and just laughs asking me what the hell I'm watching and it's legitimately embarrassing seeing the absolutely cringe on display.Not everything is the show's fault, like the katana lady who was edgy and cringe even in the books, and some of the show works like the stunning visuals, but I guess the show's worst enemies were the ones who tried to make this in the first place. You need a mature team to make this series work and we got two hacks most famous for drilling a celebrated series into the dirt. Who could have seen this coming...It's simply messy, adding aspects to the story to make it more interesting and cool when the (first two) books are already just that. You can change things, I don't mind, but just keep them consistent within the world you're displaying.",IMDB,Another disappointing Netflix adaptation? I'm shook.,10.0
"This is a very good and enjoyable series. I have seen four episodes. The one thing that is extremely annoying and distracting is that Eiza Gonzales always has her mouth open.It's open before she speaks, and after she speaks. I cannot be the only one who has noticed this. Even if she's not speaking and just working in her lab, she has her mouth open. What is up with that? I can only guess some acting teacher told her to be a great actress, she needs to keep her mouth open all the time.Other than that, everyone else in this series is very good and enjoyable to watch. The story is really interesting and I like the way they go between the past and present day.",IMDB,Why does Eiza Gonzales always have her mouth open?,6.0
"As a fan of the books, im very impressed that they managed to include all of the core themes of the books while also making it more accessible to general audiences!One of the biggest gripes a lot of people have with this show is that they ""dumbed down"" all of the science talk, and that it ""insults viewer intelligence,"" but i couldnt didagree more. The science is still there, they just dont spend 20 pages of dialogue explaining how everything works. Which for some, that's really interesting, but this is also why the books themselves, while popular, are still kind of niche. Yes, I'm sure pretty much anyone is capable of understanding the implications behind the farmer/shooter hypotheses or the two axioms of cosmic sociology or the little details of how sophons work, but ultimately not everyone is going to want to watch that. They still talk about science stuff, just not to that extent-- and I'm glad they didn't go the ""explain it to me like I'm a 3 hear old"" route. (And how else are they supposed to show every detail of how the Trisolarans/San Ti unfolded a proton into 11 dimensions without showing them visually? Personally, I'm glad they stuck to not showing the Trisolarans, as in the books.)You have to remember that books and shows are fundamentally different mediums that require different pacing and writing to keep viewers/readers engaged. With one, you can use as many words as you need to to describe scenes or inner monologues. But in a show, you can't do that without dragging on or having too much exposition. Details like what a character are thinking have to be more subtle (show dont tell!) If you want a 1:1 show recreation of the books, we already have the TenCent show!! The Netflix adaptation is an ADAPTATION, and Cixin Liu himself told the showrunners to take whatever creative liberties they needed to, and they did, and it works. The main characters were changed and split to represent a more international cast and to allow for more character development. They also set up plot bits from books 2 and 3, which i think was necessary especially for viewers who havent read the books-- you have to get people excited to watch the next season.At the end of the day, Netflix is a corporation and they want as many viewers as possible, so of course they have to make changes to the original source material. That being said, this is still an incredibly faithful adaptation that sticks to all the core themes of the books, which is ultimately what's most important. This show is for both book readers and those who are new to Three Body, and I hope it will bring a lot of new readers to the series!",IMDB,"Changes were made, but it's still an incredibly good-faith adaptation!",10.0
"I only saw the first episode, but it really bodered me how they portraited the scientists. Like a Christopher Nolan's show, the writing treats its audience as dumb and non-informed people. And even if we are uninformed, let us search for the answers ourselves. Don't overexplain every science terminology and conversation.Not only that, but the scientists are all portraited with all the stereotype that you can imagine: atheists? Check. Arrogant? Check. Using science terms for every daily chores? Check. They seem to forget that they are not their professions, but human beings. It throws me off.",IMDB,Coral narrative with flat and stereotype science characters,7.0
"Just finished watching final of 3 body problem. Bit of a crap cliff hanger ending. And how annoying was that young Latino actress who played the nano tech scientist. The worst actress I've seen in years. All she did was pout her lips and look like a bored plank of wood. She must have been sleeping with the director to get that part. Maybe spend more of the budget on better actors, than on expensive locations and cgi.Some of the cast seemed too young for the roles and weren't totally believable. The cgi was good though and the seasoned British cast's characters were likeable and believable.Otherwise it held my attention and hopefully season 2 will improve.",IMDB,Who hired Her?,8.0
"There are a lot of things to like here. The season progresses very well and the 2nd part especially is interesting and unique. The casting choices are good and Benedict Wong especially so.I never felt myself craving another episode, but I was never bored watching one.There are a lot of issues dragging the show down though and they are hard to ignore if you think too much about them.It's a bit silly that everything just so happens to revolve around and involve every member of a specific friend group. Nobody else in the world seems very important and every problem is solved by them or their work.The stages in the game make no sense. Brilliant people are chosen to play, but the solutions are banal and all amount to ""oh, you figured out that you weren't supposed to figure it out""The main issue is with the aliens though. They are insanely advanced and can learn everything about anything very quickly, but it takes them months to realize that it's possible to lie. They have no issues murdering people left and right, but they can't tolerate lying. They can put things perfectly into a mind, but somehow they can't read minds or tell when someone is lying.They also seem completely inept and accomplishing their goals. They can drive anyone to suicide, but when they actually want to kill someone, they resort to remote controlling cars and having random believers try and fail assassination.If they wanted to, they could easily just wipe out all life on the planet, but it all seems to be answered by some version of ""the lord works in mysterious ways"".I haven't read the book, so maybe there is actually a good way of resolving all of these things, but I'm worried that it will all end in a very unsatisfying way a few seasons down the line.",IMDB,Pretty good story and execution,7.0
"I share the notion with some other reviews, that this show is a bit uneven. I have not read the book, but the 1st episode hooked me good. Good pacing, good mystery, good science-fiction, feeling of something big and important going on. Just perfect. But soon other aspects of the show started appearing, and it became... Not bad, but probably not as good.It, actually, kind of reminds me of Dune, and what made Dune so difficult to adapt to screen, with politics being the main problem. There are quite a lot of politics here. They do make total sense in the context of the show, especially as more information is revealed later on, but they can still be a bit boring. And sometimes on the nose.Another problem is that I just don't believe these characters are scientists. Especially, when a cult comes into play (let me phrase it this way to avoid spoilers). I may entertain the idea, that they are smart, but that they are scientists? I don't know, they do not match the pattern that I've seen among a few real scientists, that I've known during my higher education. In fact, I would say that it is difficult for me to buy whatever occupation is for most of the characters in the show, besides, maybe the teacher guy. They do not feel ""human"" enough, I guess.Nevertheless, this was overall a good watch for me. Can't say I will recommend it to everyone, but I can definitely recommend trying it, while keeping in mind, that this is partially like a prologue, based on certain things happening in the end. I expect, that things can get closer to what was happening during 1st episode.",IMDB,Uneven,9.0
"To all naysayers and book purists: go read your books. This is TV sci-fi and it is clever and entertaining. Oh, you found plot holes and impossibilities? OK genius, I think some folks are giving you a treat at the end of the hallway. For the rest of us, leave us alone, enjoy sci fi series for once and move on.Yes, it has its slow moments, yes, it has some problems. What movie or series does not have it?? Please, save us from your gasp and shock. For those of us who do not bother with the books, oh blasphemy! HahaEnjoy it as I did. The idea is a great variation of the usual ""aliens are here to invade earth"". It gives perspective that it may be as difficult to them as it is for us to travel all the space distance. It also explores human reactions when the danger isn't that imminent.

"This is an interesting story told reasonably well but let down by some poor scriptwriting and poor pacing. The characters are, by and large, acceptable but Liam Cunningham is alone in being head and shoulders above the rest of the cast. There's little tension at any point which doesn't engender any real commitment to the series. Scientifically it is typical tv sci-fi so nitpicking is pointless but some errors are unacceptable. My favourite is the scene when the plate on the spacecraft holding the cable attached to the sail comes loose. It is evidently held in place by screws (or, at best ,small bolts). It's a jerry-built spacecraft which so easily could have looked like it was built by people who knew what they were doing.",IMDB,Not bad but not good,10.0
"Not read the book so came to this as totally new - the concept, the characters and the thrills and spills made it compelling viewing for me.The blend of science and concepts I could relate to such as religious fanaticism and virtual reality worked well.I've read some other reviews being critical of the non-serious characters, but I totally disagree. Even top scientists are human, and the storyline did not try to paint them as anything other than human, with their doubts, frailties, friendships and needs.

"Yeah I read the books, and don't care that they altered the story. It's just too dumbed down and characters are trash.Western audiences think of themselves as sofiticated. True, in most cases Hollywood mainstream stylistic and writing do feel superior to everything else out there qualitatively. Here however marketing strategy for mainstream audiences is taking priority over the story.First of all the show could have been waay more Chinease. And that would be FINE. We don't really engage much with that part of the world especially when it comes to movies. It's a Chinease book anyway so why not. The historic and political context is difficult to monouver about and, that's what makes it interesting. With a proper western cinematic style this could have become something admired BOTH in China and in the West. A wasted opportunity.Casting is weak and characters are trash. An instagram model Auggie (aka nerdy scientist) and her friends struggle with morality of difficult choices in the face of an alien invasion. They don't really give any credible position on the subject, all it takes is to remind them (every time) that aliens are coming so...¯\_('')_/¯ I guess the trolley dillema loses a bit of steam if you introduce the existance of the whole humanity forever on one side.Story is dumbed down. In the book we got fluctuations of Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation measured on a scientific aparature. Here we get blinking stars. They think audience is too dumb to get excited about real science. I guess the CMB, for which discovery 2 american scientists recieved Nobel Prize as recently as 2006, is just too boring for the dum-dums. Sarcasm aside, I don't believe so and that's my point. This should have been Oppenheimer level science storytelling and its not even Bill Nye .The Staircase project is about detonating atomic bomb just behind the sail in vicinity of the probe and attachment cables. Nice.Auggie is coming up with brilliant production-ready applications of the recently discovered nano-fibers but we barely see her solving science problems. She drinks a lot tho, not for a second ceasing to look hot af btw.There is this one time ETO tries to recruit couple of friends and then kill the one who refuses. They still expect other friend to be generally cool with it because it's the Lords plan lol.There is whole plot about dying dude who couldn't move on from the girl he secretly loves.

The characters and plot have been terribly altered. Can you imagine Sophon being unfolded into two dimensions and wrapping around the entire Earth? Some of the most charismatic characters in the book have been reduced to mere background characters in this adaptation. The only merit, compared to the Tencent version from China, is that it somewhat ""completely"" covered the Cultural Revolution segment of the story, but even this was poorly executed, faring much worse than the depiction in the 80s' ""The Last Emperor"".

"Positives:
The show is well made. Production value is great. I personally like a slow tempo, setting things up and unravelling the mystery bit by bit. Some cast choices I really liked.The bad stuff:
Some of the characters fall flat, and painfully so. Just not working for me, and I can sense their ""on camera vibe"", so I guess it's not working for them either. Not sure if it's casting, directing, script or the source material.I just finished episode 5 and it brings up bad memories. I only read the 3rd book of the series, after picking it up at a train station for a longer journey. Some aspects were really good, some were just awful. Especially the one-dimensional characterisation of women.Episode 5 and the ""Ship Scene"" really reminded me of how nonsensical the plot can be, based on the many shortcomings of the source material.So... this is the ONLY way to solve the issue? Watch it and you know what I mean.What I hated about the book the most:
The romantic partner of the main character was such a hollow, lifeless side-note, only there to deliver prompts so the author could clean up a completely pointless emotional growth journey for the man.The metaphorical fig leaf over the not-so-metaphorical plot holes.Overall: watchable if you're bored.

You can tell they pull all the stops.I just can't wait for second season, peaple who has not read the books just do not know what they have in store for them.These books are not about the plot (in my humble opinión), they are about ideas, they introduce you to new and very interesting concepts about physics, game theory and even human nature in a way that is just mesmerizing, the wallfacer concept, just wow.I am sure this is a hit for Netflix and second season is already on the works.",IMDB,First time in my life I have reivew anything.

I understand that it is not 1:1 adaptation of the source material, but as a TV show I think it really hits on all the marks. They are still faithful to the major plot points, eventho they make some very crucial changes.

"3 body problem is an interesting sci-fi premise wherein a advanced alien civilization has telegraphed their intentions to conquer earth in 400 years time, and have sent omnipotent spy computers to watch our every move as well as to engage in psychological warfare, in an effort to claim earth for themselves.After a decent first three episodes, the show falls off a cliff, there are casting problems, writing problems, such as why are British involved? Britian has no space program in real life, no natural resources etc. If Aliens arrived Britain would be a trivial country, - so poor scifi there as its not realistic in the slightest.Then there are two women cast in important roles as leading scientists, one of the actors has had obvious cosmetic surgery and is sporting pornstar lips, while being cast as having invented some gobbldygook mcguffin weapon, its ludicrous. The other scientist is poorly developed and is herself just a mcguffin for the cancer sidestory.Oh yeah, there's a cancer death, long and drawn out, so you can enjoy that ride.The final ""twist"" is that a somewhat disinterested scientist is given immense power by the UN (How exactly?) to prepare earth for invasion. I found this to be very lazy and really the second half of the show just never really picks up.If Aliens did as the show premised, then it would have been interesting to see how the UN achieves it's new immense power, to supercede laws and assume a role as World Government, but the show thinks you are a bit dim, so they just did it OK? Also hilarious to see the UN Secretary Gen cast as an American black lady. In the end this is a muddled show, with pacing and writing issues. The writing is dumbed down, as is to be expected by contemporary cinema, and the plot with the ultimately facile cancer story started to drone on about half way through.No real standout performances, but couldn't get over the British Royal Navy (who can't even float an air craft carrier) getting involved. Britian in the 21st century is not a Naval, Space, or geopolitical force, so it was a tough ask to believe the fantasy that the Royal Navy would have any real role, or humanist intention for that matter. Perhaps if the show was made 15 years ago this would have been a plausible scifi outcome, but unfortunately it seems really really dated. The most important goverments in the event of an Alien invasion would be the US, China, Russia, Brazil, India, and Australia. Tiny countries like the UK and Estonia would just be hangers on the to decisions and actions taken by Great Power countries, and I was surprised to see this ""adaptation"" stretch credulity like that when there is, to be fair, lots of juicy scifi concepts all over the show - probably its biggest strength. More needed to happen this season, and ultimately the show disappoints despite having lots of potential.",IMDB,British gonna save us lol.,6.0

There are numerous fan fiction stories, one of which made it as the unofficial 4th book in the series.But what I find strange is that there are huge scenes that are following the book closely and the the others are dangerously close to trash.The main characters are not believable as top scientists. Some of it had to do with poor casting, a lot with the idiotic dialogue. These are top minds of the world and they speak like edgy 20 yos. They don't gratuitously swear.Apart from that, we also see the, now classic, strong female character trope (that replaces the man main character). That's fine, it doesn't matter, the story is much larger. But all the male characters are pathetic, useless, clumsy idiots that constantly need assistance. I whish Hollywood BS would have just stood this one out. This story not a good place for moral preaching.The CGI is sometimes amazing, sometimes cheap. The story is the same.I wish we could have had a slower story, with a smaller cast, more science and less teenage drama.",IMDB,"High hopes, medium returns",6.0
"This show really picks up speed by the end of the first episode. That had me hooked and then me and my fiancé watched the rest of the show in one evening. Episode 7 was a bit slow, don't grab snacks for that one, but other than that it was really good. My favorite episodes were the ones with the game, that was super exciting. I really had a hard time caring about the flashbacks to 1960's China until I understood why it was important, I just hate when shows drag but this show really does have a nice flow and tempo. Definitely recommend! I want season 2 asap, I'm an avid book reader but I've never wanted to buy this book in the store and I'm glad I didn't because I really think it needed D&D to write the screenplay for it to reach its full potential in my eyes, that's just my personal opinion. The acting was great, I liked the cast a lot and the visuals are impeccable.",IMDB,"Worth watching, I promise",10.0
"The build up through the first 4-5 episodes lines this series up for a great tale that leaves one expecting more than it delivers.The story relies on flashbacks and jumps to present to build a very good narrative. This narrative builds to a few interesting twists and flashpoints that becomes slower towards the ending episodes.Some epic and stunning scenes however make this a worthwhile watch. Casting is very good, performances are believable and the entire story leaves one hoping to see more of this story to be made by the end.Definitely a great Sci Fi offering mixed with mystery and fantasy with a dose of factual and even historical context. *(referencing the WOW! Signal, and starting during the cultural revolution in China).Obviously targeted towards nerds and sci fi geeks with heavy references to Nano tech, particle physics and astronomical science fields interwoven with dimensional theoretic research and Virtual reality gaming. Well made and at times intensely interesting, while having long moments of slow dialogue. Overall worth a 7/10.",IMDB,Great foundation for a thriller that simmers not boils,7.0
"I cover the implausibility and stupidity in the next section of this review. Firstly, I would like to address how utterly painfully dull and boring this show is. Tedious hours of sleep-inducing dialogue between characters that no one cares about. Honestly, is there any character in the show that you don't want to die? I can't think of one.It's like someone said, you know what is wrong with sci-fi... All the damn science fiction! I want a sci-fi show that focusses on the soap opera drama of who loves who and should I tell them, rather than doing much actual science fiction.There is no tension, no suspense, no immersion, no world building, nothing. The characters are dull, unbelievable and most unforgivably they are boring. It's like the script writers were told to write for drill bits rather than humans.This show makes no sense at all, at any point. Here are some of the most glaring and insulting aspects of the show:
1. How many decades were the aliens talking to the old white dude on the boat before they realised that humans can lie? This is shockingly stupid. Moreover, how do their omniscient proton sized all seeing super computers miss this fact? These supercomputers are so powerful they can control all the technology on the planet but for some reason, they missed that humans can lie. Ok
2. The supercomputers and their alien cult were actively disrupting human scientific discoveries, murdering scientists and driving them mad with visions... Before they decided that humans can't be trusted. So why did they abandon their cult? Stupid.3. Why would this alien species create a simulation in which to tell a couple of humans of their dastardly plan? Great idea that, never goes wrong. Not only did they tell them, ""This is our plan"", but part of the explanation also includes their weakness. They need humans to not develop technology, or they won't be able to invade. Oh, and they gave humanity a 400-year head start of trying to overcome this problem. Mental.4. How in all that is holy, is using a nano egg slicer to cut a tanker to shreds, the best way of ensuring you do not destroy the alien tech onboard? How? Why? What???? Absolutely beyond stupid.5. Why did they let the traitor woman go? She keeps saying, what crime have I been arrested for? How about murder, conspiracy to murder, risks to national security. Or how about being a traitor to the entire human race and potentially all life on planet Earth. But sure, let her go free, why not, what's the worst that could happen? Unbelievable nonsense.6. The scientists that willingly put on alien tech VR helmets are incapable of seeing the risk in wearing a mind reading helmet. Hmmm, very clever geniuses.Surely if an alien species wanted to colonise Earth, with the tech they have available to them; why not use it crash all the planes, turn off the internet, power down the power stations. Seed chaos and provoke in fighting, pitch people against themselves with a war of propaganda.Or why not just launch all the nukes, take over and control advanced military systems like cruisers and stuff, destroy humanity with its own weapons. Seems a lot more effective than using moderately harsh language to insult us (you are bugs).In fact, why not go to a planet that doesn't have an advanced sentient race capable or destroying you if you get here too late? Is there a rush? Do they only have 400 years before they run out of fuel and snacks?Surely, if they can unfold higher dimensions of physical space to expand a proton to the size of a planet and turn it into an omniscient supercomputer; they could terraform a planet? It makes no sense.Whoever wrote this show should be forced to watch it sober, while someone shouts at them ""WHY?"".If you want better sci-fi shows, watch any of these: The Expanse, Altered Carbon, Love Death Robots, Black Mirror, and Battlestar Galactica.",IMDB,As boring as it is dumb,1.0
"Great adaptation! I was constantly clapping throughout the show because I could see the pieces being set up for future installments. Adds more character to each of the main people in the book trilogy-I loved their interactions that we didn't get to see a lot of in the book. This shows how strong of a sci-fi plot these books have and by combining setup from all three books creates a better weaving of storylines. We need season 2 and 3. The events in this season are well performed, but you can feel that this is really just setting up much bigger things to come!

"The first five episodes of this series are phenomenal regarding plot. The tension, weight, and unknown knowledge is tantalizing to say the last, which helps push past some of its unlikable or flat characters. Jin is probably one of the more interesting characters whose story arc is done the most justice. I think growth needs to be seen in other characters more quickly, or perhaps the nuance needed for the larger philosophical questions the show poses needs more time. I feel that with Jin and Will most. Are some choices far fetched and illogical even for a grand sci-fi world such as this? Yes, but on the whole it works out. Again, the first five episodes are stellar (word pun for those who have seen the show). It is definitely worth watching, and I hope gets a second season!",IMDB,"Great plot, some major characters are lacking",6.0
"3 Body Problem: The first novel in the trilogy by Cixin Liu has been adapted for television.

The characters are richly developed, each with their own complexities and motivations. Landscapes of alien worlds to breathtaking depiction of advanced technology, the visuals are simply spectacular.The source material requires some active engagement and a willingness to grapple with complex scientific concepts and philosophical themes. While this may pose a challenge with shows typically being background noise for me while I work, I've been more than willing to invest my time and attention replaying the series to catch missed pieces. It's a rather thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating compilation.Slow at times, particularly in the early episodes as the groundwork is laid for the narrative. Similarly to The Peripheral on Amazon Prime, the show is not ideal for passive casual viewing. Though with thought-provoking ideas and exploring the boundless possibilities of the universe, for fans of science fiction and intellectual brainstorming, this series is personally an unexpected winner.",IMDB,Thought-provoking ideas & exploration of boundless possibilities,10.0
"I've never read the books, so rest assured I don't view 3BP as some sort of sacred cow, never to be touched unless to achieve pure perfection. However this series does struggle.My biggest gripe, is the trailers present this show to us as a dazzling, big-budget, mind-bending sci-fi epic. However 95% of the scenes look and feel like they're straight out of a low-quality BBC drama. It's drudging at times, and you do start to feel like you're never going to get the pay-off you deserve at the end.And after 8 episodes, that's pretty much what happens. I'm aware that the original story is complex and will take time to come fruition on screen, which is fine, but you need something along the way to keep you with it. It's sorely lacking in this regard.A cruel yet reasonably accurate summary, would be a group of friends gassing about how clever they are for 8 episodes, interspersed with a few scenes of psychedelic space-guff that never seems to progress anywhere quickly.I've been harsh here, but the premise is intriguing enough for me to watch a second season if it ever comes to pass.

"The show is so uneven and uninteresting. I'd go as far as saying it's one of the most unengaging series I've seen in a very long time. The actors are terrible, except for one actor who gets killed off in the first few episodes. Some of the acting is just plain wooden (for instance the Navy officer). There are a 2-3 thrilling VFX scenes but apart from that the show is very dialogue heavy and a lot of it is just badly written. There are so many scenes that are stretched out for no reason and you could easily fast forward the whole series and still not miss any crucial plot points.

This has got to be one to watch. I was even prepared for it to be weird with a fair amount to be expected not to be explained and revealed later. What I wasn't prepared for was the video game element by an alien race that doesn't understand the concept of lying that is doing just that, while travelling over 400 years to get to earth from a dying planet to destroy the earth for humanity so as to keep it for the aliens. These aliens call themselves Lord and revealed themselves to humanity in the Wow signal, and told us not to respond as if we did we would regret it. And it all seems to being coordinated from the UK which is completely bizarre and not the USA! Story in a nutshell. It's a bit like Monty Python does alien invasion.

"As a seasoned fan of the original work, I'm very satisfied with the adaptation! I understand that this book might be difficult for Western countries to grasp, especially the part about the Cultural Revolution at the beginning. As a part of Chinese history, it remains very sensitive, and many works must be subtly filmed domestically. But Netflix has managed to produce it. This is the beginning of all stories, where despair for humanity drives Ye Wenjie to seek help from other civilizations. She betrays Earth, for a very understandable reason.This version with adaptations seems to be huge, but be patient please. If you finished the whole season and you are TRULY familiar with the book, you will find that all adaptations was very creative and fantastic and it's very fun to guess which person represent which one in the book. It will blow up your mind in the end and you will smile knowingly.Although there are a lot of people complaining the change of characters, the core of this story was kept and filmed in a way that deelply shows the main conflict between people's politically view, belief and destination.

"Eric's Grade: A-
'3 Body Problem' is an American adaptation of the Chinese novel of the same name by Liu Cixin. The series was created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss of 'Game of Thrones' fame along with Alexander Woo. 'The Three Body Problem' is the first book of a trilogy called 'Remembrance of Earth's Past' all of which were highly acclaimed science fiction books. The novels deal begin during China's Cultural Revolution before getting into a first contact narrative along with some incredibly hard science fiction concepts. For the television show the primarily Chinese cast has been turned into an internationally flavored cast based mainly out of England which is a bit easier for western audiences to digest. This first season presupposes that there will be more seasons coming to develop the story as nothing is clearly resolved as the credits roll and there is still a vast amount of narrative ground to cover. Season 1 debuted on the Netflix streaming platform in March 2024 totaling 8 roughly hour long episodes.During China's Cultural Revolution Ye Wenjie witnesses the death of her father before getting sent to a remote camp called Red Coast Base. There she discovers they are seeking extra terrestrial intelligence. She actually makes contact, but the resultant message is a warning, and it is left to her to decide to proceed at humanity's peril or abandon the effort. In the UK in present time we are introduced to a handful of young physicists who are friends, acquaintances and colleagues. Recently physics experiments have been going awry derailing high level scientific experimentation. In addition a large number of physicists have been bizarrely committing suicide. A couple of the friends receive a headset that is technologically advanced and places the wearer in an extremely lifelike simulation with no real stated mission other than to figure out stable versus chaotic eras on a planet in a multiple star system hence the 3 Body Problem of the title. As the layers of the onion are peeled away humanity pivots from the idea that this is all a great cosmic oddity to the idea that not only are aliens real, but they are on their way and are possibly here already. How will humanity deal with that knowledge and prepare for what's coming?Liu Cixin's novels are incredibly high concept and deal with some pretty dense physics so I was fascinated to see how this adaptation would incorporate what is some pretty hefty science into an entertaining and digestible narrative. I think this show succeeds in an area where many may feel the novels lack a bit and that is in their characters. I remember less the characters from the books and more recall things that happened to specific characters. Part of that may be me getting muddled in a decent quantity of Chinese names that all sound very similar. Here greater care is taken to make each character important and have agency. Another change along those lines that works for the better, although perhaps a bit improbable, is to make many of the primary characters a group of friends. In the book all of these characters were disparate people for the most part, but it means a bit more as they struggle together, not only for humanity, but for one another. Most of the actors are unknowns with some notable exceptions including 'Game of Thrones' alums John Bradley and Liam Cunningham along with Jonathan Pryce and Bendict Wong. All involved do a very good job here. Not everything is explained, but it doesn't really need to be. This is an adaptation that can be enjoyed by fans of the book, but also the show doesn't weigh itself down with dense concepts and instead lets the camaraderie of the characters hold it up so that by the final episode you are invested as much in their fate as you are in the fate of humanity. I hope that '3 Body' secures more seasons and is allowed to tell its story in full because, if the first season is any indication, it could be a heck of a ride.",IMDB,"3 Body Problem season 1 (2024, Netflix) High concept science fiction gets a stunning treatment from Netflix and creators Benioff and Weiss",9.0
"Yes we are, but that is one of the few scientific correct statements in the show ;-)There are many exaggerations, mostly in physics, which are communicated in all seriousness, and that obviously comes from the source material, which I did not read btw. But I watched 'The wandering Earth' movie, which is also an adaptation of a story by the same author, and is sometimes ridiculously over-the-top exaggerating even for very seasoned suspenders of disbelief.Since this series is a western production, it fits more into our world as we are perceiving it, and thus can be more serious while still believable.However, the show is more of an ensemble-driven Mystery/Drama/Thriller, and lives mostly from the great performances of its actors, foremost Liam Cunningham, Jess Hong and Eiza Gonzales. On the negative side, some actors are wasted, like Jonathan Pryce (Evans) or Saamer Usmani (Raj).The dialogs are sometimes a bit clumsy or not really elaborated, but mostly of decent quality. The best lines got Thomas Wade, and they give Liam Cunningham the opportunity to steal every scene where he has to deliver them. Though this is the best and most humorous character in the show, he is also the most unbelievable one, a superman of espionage and tactical knowledge, but also equipped with nearly unlimited financial resources and power to found and run single-handedly the complete defense program against the aliens. His rank or position is never really shown IIRC, but in the books he is a general, I think.Pacing is a bit slow, but It seems that the producers wanted to create a very close adaptation of the source material, with some added diversity in location, race, and spirit.The score is noticeably made by a master of the arts, who is, in this case. Ramin Djawadi.I think they succeeded in creating a captivating high-profile show, but failed to deliver something extraordinary.There are some cruel scenes (in the beginning, but also later near the end), which in my opinion are not beneficial to the overall value of the show.I give this show a harsh 6 for several missed opportunities, but I highly recommend it as a very good binge-watch.",IMDB,We Are Bugs,7.0
"""The Three-Body Problem"" is an ambitious sci-fi series that takes bold strides in tackling complex ideas but falls short of fully developing its compelling concepts. Based on the acclaimed novel by Liu Cixin, the show explores the ramifications of humanity making contact with an alien civilization through multiple storylines spanning centuries.Visually stunning vistas of its futuristic world and thoughtful examinations of science, history and the human condition make ""The Three-Body Problem"" a feast for minds that enjoy pondering our place in the vast cosmos. It's clear the creators aimed to craft a sprawling yet intricate tapestry in the vein of lauded predecessors like ""Game of Thrones"" with their exploration of an expansive sci-fi universe.However, as with any ambitious undertaking, not all elements are perfectly executed. While the intriguing scenarios the characters find themselves in kept viewers engaged, some felt less connected to the people at the center of the story than the grand ideas they grappled with. Additionally, the series sometimes struggled to weave its many plot threads together cohesively or explain complex scientific concepts in an accessible way for all audiences.With more focus given to allowing the audience to relate to the characters on a deeper level and simplifying dense explanations so as not to lose less scientifically-minded viewers, ""The Three-Body Problem"" could have achieved greatness. As it stands, it remains a thought-provoking, if flawed, addition to sci-fi that leaves the mind pondering its mysteries long after the final scene. While not perfect, it takes admirable strides in asking stimulating questions about humanity's place in the stars.",IMDB,An Ambitious yet Flawed Sci-Fi Epic,10.0

Different maybe, but enjoyable.I can see they (Netflix) have made an effort to get away from the usual sci-fi trope of casting models as key characters, though could still do better, both Liam and Benedict are great characters.Prior poor reviews seem to be stuck in one of two camps, either the anally retentive who complain the script doesn't stick to the Chinese book and characters or those who similarly moan about the science.

"There's the story. Then there's the characters. A great story will survive clumsy characters. Great characters you'll come back and watch even if the story is nonsense or the production weak.

Some of the acting is not great - I mean acting = talking without blinking or disturbing the lipstick on my new trout pout, not great.They've tried to do the same Expanse/Game of Thrones thing with a whole gang of fascinating people. But by and large the characters are a bit dull or as flat as a dehydrated alien.So a brave attempt, but the doubters who said the books were unfilmable might have had a point. The things that made the original story was the occasional pauses to dip into interesting details and personal dynamics - like in the cultural revolution. But there's no time for that. We're skimming the fine detail to chase the story.It takes most of the first book and hindsight over the story to begin to appreciate the aliens and what's happening.

"Game of Thrones: Universe. Sci-fi horror that isn't afraid to be geeky. Am enjoying up to Episode 4 so far. The subtext of America vs China in the original story dont make sense given America's superior technical achievements. The show is an improvement over the book's weaknesses. I hope they continue the story, We need more series and movies like this that explore more interesting ""good guy"" ""bad guy"" dynamics like this one. Also nice to see science or some physics in movies to push peoples imaginations on what's possible. Overall Absolutely brilliant, the show actually let's you think a bit deeper about humanity and the what ifs. A must watch for any sci-fi fan. Definitely needs a season 2 & 3.",IMDB,very impressive and joyful recreation.,7.0
"I haven't read the book (translated version), but I'm sure scientists the world over are mature people who have reached the pinnacle of profession after years of struggle and hard work. The scientists in this series are young 20 somethings? Wow! Are they all child prodigies? Or did Benioff and Weiss make this series only for young target audience? Anyway, the acting sucks. Benedict Wong looks amused all the time. Maybe he was wondering ""what am I doing here""?And there is no need to need to kill characters off a la Game of Thrones! Do these guys know how to write anything apart from popcorn chaos thrillers?Had more expectations. Ah well! Better luck next season guys.",IMDB,Not riveting enough,10.0
"As someone who read the original novel, I honestly didn't expect much from this adoption because i know it is extremely hard to tell this complex story plus the hardcore sci-fi elements are puzzling. But I was really impressed after binge-watching all of the episodes and it was really really good. The casts performed a masterclass in acting and the music and the filming are simply brilliant. I understand that for some audiences, some part of this show so far seems boring and too focused on some individuals; however, I promise you that it will get better in the next season (i really hope that there will be a season 2 and 3). Season 1 is more like an introduction to what is going to happen next and the original novel's brilliance starts in the 2nd book. This is not like Dune or Star Wars or some other sci-fi where it's just basically a family story in a futuristic setting. This is a HARD-CORE sci-fi with a BIG picture.",IMDB,"Believe me if Netflix renew it, u all will witness something u won't forget!!",7.0

"3 Body Problem Season 1 - 10/10 - Strap in for the ultimate sci-fi thrill ride! What initially hooked me was the futuristic tech, but boy, did this series deliver so much more. Picture this: governments gearing up for a battle with aliens centuries down the line. It's a premise that grabs you from the get-go. And let's talk about that ensemble cast - a reunion of sorts from the Game of Thrones crew, all under the guidance of their old director. Now, I confess, I didn't read the books, so the story was a whirlwind of imagination and boundary-pushing concepts. Mysterious deaths, genius minds, an intense video game, cult worshippers, and a grand initiative to save humanity - this show had it all, and then some. But let's address the elephant in the room - those San Ti. I was on the edge of my seat, hoping for some interaction, especially with Will, post-launch. Alas, it wasn't meant to be. But every scene that they were in I was always hoping for more. The intrigue of alien life just had me cooked, because you know we do not know what's out there as well. Nevertheless, this series delves deep into mystery, action, and of course, sci-fi goodness. Each episode was a journey, seamlessly blending intrigue and depth. Season 2 can't come soon enough.

"Props to Benioff and Weiss. I love these books. And they have done an excellent job adapting the series so far. They made a LOT of ambitious changes. And most of them really work to help the story. The original story does not work on the screen, and the changes they made are all in service of something interesting to WATCH, not just interesting to READ. The character changes, the movement to a world scope as opposed to a China scope, the blending of the novels, the increased action and dramatization - all of these aid in telling the story for television. (If you've read the books and you're annoyed by the drama between the characters, think of how much better this is than Luo Ji's fictional girlfriend - there's going to be actual people involved in this subplot.) My only real critique is that some of the science makes less sense with the added spectacle. Cixin Liu writes science fiction, but he does an excellent job anchoring the science fiction in real science, which is part of what makes the book series special. The TV series still does science, but it drifts more toward the fiction end of the spectrum, which is bad, since the science is really compelling. Please bring back some of Liu's wonderful analogies. Overall, I was very pleased, and I'm looking forward to season 2.",IMDB,Give us season 2,6.0
"I find this incredibly rushed. The funny thing is, when I was watching it, it did not feel that way. But I watched the Chinese version after this, which stretches to 30 episodes, and then the enormous rushing of this Netflix adaptation becomes clearer.And the silly thing is, they could have rushed less if they had taken out all the unnecessary drama around Will Downing and his love for Jin and his fears about telling her. So incredibly unnecessary, it added absolutely nothing to the story, and love angles like that are tired and boring and old. And then at the end when Jin hears that he loved her, THEN she suddenly knows that she loves him too and then it's too late. Booooring.And then they could have taken a little bit more time to work on the story itself and given the characters a bit more time to discover things.Because as it is, they never do anything wrong. They never have to question anything, because before they can question it, the solution is already presented. All in neat little packages, and that's that.And then there's the glaring plot hole of the three people appointed to think for themselves about a solution without talking about it with anyone. Great idea, in theory, in practice you have no chance to get anywhere with that, because the next generation will have to start all over again because the three original people will not be able to share what they have been thinking of. They can't even share what they found that would not be working, because that would also give away everything to the Sophons.I don't know if that plot hole is in the book, because I have not read that (yet), but either it's in the book and they should have covered that, or it's not in the book and they made it.So all in all, even tho I found the story interesting and I watched it all in a few days and had quite a rush from it, in hindsight I can't give it more than a 6. It simply has too many flaws.",IMDB,Way too much content for just 8 episodes,9.0

I had only heard about the show through some friends and did not know what it was about, i decided to give it a shot. I had expected a generic space dram but boy was i surprised. I think i enjoyed it better because i didnt know anything about the story line before starting the show, i suggest you do the same. If you like Arrival, Contact, Oblivion and media along this line the n this show is definately for you.Kudos to showrunners for not shying away from the brutal and gore scenes that do advance the storyline perfectly and which were the logocal step a military commander would have taken to save the humanity and for the greater good.

"A clever piece of entertainment, with a secret message: as soon as a character feels stressed? Smoking a cigarette is the sure-fire solution. Note how many scenes have gratuitous cigarette smoking.

However, what's more surprising is that sales of other competitor cigarette brands (Camel, Parliament, Newport, etc.) also go up,"" says Pradeep Chintagunta of the University of Chicago.

"I read the trilogy last year and had serious doubts about how this would translate to the screen. I was particularly concerned when I learned that the main character of first book had been split into several different characters. But now I am happy to report that it all works perfectly. The story remains essentially the same, with all major events present. The splitting of the character also makes sense, and very little (if anything) is lost in the process. I also get the desire to split the character to ensure continuity throughout the series-assuming we get more than one season-since each book has a different main character. Honestly, without spoiling anything, how they set the stage already for things to come in the later books is nothing short of brilliant. Bravo.",IMDB,A Surprisingly Excellent Adaption,6.0
"I never read the books, but I can already tell the amount of changes made to it to fit the taste of the western audience. I will say this though, the story is intriguing and the script well-adapted.However, I have issues with this adaptation, mainly what Hollywood unnecessarily dictates these days:--1 star for the almost total replacement of the Chinese elements.-1 star for the insistence of replacing all Chinese characters and replacing them with DEI people.-1 star for putting an Indian and a Chinese as a couple; in real life that is highly improbable.-1 star for not using better looking female lead.",IMDB,Could have been better,9.0

I feel that the ending is totally unjustified. Atleast the makers would have left us on a cliff hanger, but they didn't . It felt incomplete at the end. Some episodes were really nice with VFX but some of them were just filled with conversation between the characters. They didn't even disclose the "" details of the human leader (the one who is boss- that old man) "".

Overall it's a pretty middle of the road show with one standout exception, Liam Cunningham.Every second Liam Cunningham is speaking, he forces you to hang on every word. You can tell it's his performance and not the writing because his line delivery is far batter then everyone else on the show.I'd also like to give credit to Benedict Wong, another actor who clearly understands his craft.

When you believe that things can't get worse they actually do. Many people feel that there are hidden powers controlling every aspect of our lives and everything we say, eat and do. Even our politicians, the wars and the alliances we made are being controlled by unknown powers that we aren't allowed to know about. There are so many questions, so much censure and so few answers.

"This is fun sci fi and the plot wins out despite some spotty performances and one particularly horrible casting choice. Eiza Gonzales is terrible but it's not all her fault because the writing for her is awful. Despite this, surely someone would be more believable as a genius who created a groundbreaking technology. It makes no sense for this character to be such an emotionally reactive and irrational person. Add Eiza's relentless overacting and it is so distracting that when the plot focuses on her it's almost preferable to fast forward through. This and some other weird choices and mismanagement make this a somewhat obnoxious watch at times, but overall, it's worth a few hours of your time.",IMDB,Cleverness overcomes bad casting,3.0

"""The Three-Body Problem"" is one of my favorite sci-fi novels. I first read the trilogy 11 years ago during middle school, and it left me so shocked that I couldn't sleep at night. Over the years, there have been many adaptations of this novel, all of which have been controversial and somewhat disappointing in various aspects. Because of this, I had high hopes for Netflix's adaptation. Unfortunately, after watching the series this weekend on a trip, I can only say that my feelings are mixed, but I still recommend it.It's difficult to regard Netflix's ""3 Body Problem"" as the same entity as the novel, just as it's hard to consider Apple's version of ""Foundation"" as ""The Foundation Series."" If you're expecting something on the level of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, you're likely to find that it feels more like ""The Rings of Power"" instead. With a shell and some settings from the book, it drastically simplifies technology, logic, characters, and even the sociology and anthropology of power, individuals, and societies, opting instead for a timeless love story.From the perspective of the original work, I am greatly disappointed. However, when I think about it, it is, after all, a Netflix sci-fi series with good visual effects (in some parts), a tight plot, and innovative settings from ""The Three-Body Problem."" It's accessible for the average viewer and not bad by any means. If you haven't read the original book, this series will definitely be very interesting, and I hope it might inspire some interest in reading the original.I'm not a purist for the original work and I believe that adaptations should differ from the novel, but how to make these choices and how to present the essence of the novel in a different form is a question Denis Villeneuve answered in a unique way through what he left unsaid, but not what Benioff and Weiss has done in oversimplifying the plots and relationships.",IMDB,A Mixed Reception: Navigating the Netflix Adaptation of 'The Three-Body Problem',7.0
"I read the book first and this comment is about some comparision between the show and the book. Overall I love the show which put live to the charachters in the book. A lot of the imaginations in the book is hard to visualize. I love the quality of the visualizations in the san-ti game, but think the pase is too fast, not enough failure to show the historical steps to gradually understanding the san-ti world. The story between Will and Jin is presented well. The show's pace is very fast which is a double edge sword since it reveals a lot of suspense in latter books. This one one side makes the actions of people easier to understand which is good for TV format's audience who does not have time to pause and digging deeper, but at the same time this change removed a lot of the suspense and mystery feeling.",IMDB,Incredible adaptation,10.0
"Not very close to the source but still a good adaptation imo. Negatives were the shortening of the first part of the book. Liked the casting and the adaptation from a chinese-aimed setting to a more international one.I'm also a bit sad that the sciency part of it whole was reduced, but its kind of positivie since the book has almost too much time spent on the 'game' and spent too much time explaining what an XOR gate was.

"I've just started watching this series and it looks promising. It's well-filmed, fast-paced, and has a cinematic feel, like you'll be eating a lot of popcorn and drinking a lot of coke for many episodes. The only thing that seems factually inconsistent is the scene at the beginning at a prestigious university in 1960s China where ""counter-revolutionaries"" are being brought on to a stage to be shamed by student soldiers of Mao's Cultural Revolution. A woman--I assume to be a member of the Red Guard--harangues a professor of physics and accuses Einstein of supporting the ""American imperialists"" to build the atomic bomb. What I don't understand is why this woman would focus on Einstein when there was a prominent Chinese physicist named Wu Chien-Shiung, who joined the Manhattan Project to help build the bomb. Einstein was a U. S. citizen, so it's no surprise if he contributes to his country's war efforts and scientific research. However, Wu Chien-Shiung was born in China (and almost won the Nobel Prize in physics but was snubbed for being a woman). Why would the Red Guard soldier focus on Einstein and not on the Chinese scientist who worked on the same bomb? Seems odd.",IMDB,Strange factual inaccuracies,6.0
"This has to be the worst adaptation I've ever laid eyes on, if one could even call it that. Quite literally, everything is changed for the worse, even the simplest details that did not need a change. I'm not even talking about ""westernization"" of the plot, like changing the character names, the place that the story takes place etc. Think about any scene in the series and it's either completely different in the books, or it doesn't even exist. The whole concept of ""countdown"" is way too simplified and the entire suspense of it is gone. It wasn't long ago that we had 24 episode per season series, and a lot of the plot that's cut doesn't even require any CGI. Ye Wenjie has almost completely different personality. Everything that makes Shi Qiang, Da Shi is competely gone, well other than the fact that he smokes a lot. I suppose our brilliant producers thought that smoking a lot is enough personality trait. There are so many things I could write just from the first episode alone but what's the point.I strongly suggest everyone to not watch this piece of garbage, either read the books or just spend your time on something else altogether.Finally, remember these names: David Benioff, D. B. Weiss.Do not ever forget them, and avoid everything like a plague with their name on it.

Season 1 effortlessly weaves complex scientific concepts with human drama, creating a narrative that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally and visually compelling. The series excels in bringing an intricate world to life, with stunning visuals that are both breathtaking and thought-provoking. The actors bring depth and nuance to their characters, making you deeply invested in their journeys.

"Fabulous adaptation of this great science fiction novel with just enough changes to make it more digestible for a TV audience.

There were many surprisingly touching and heart tugging moments that were kept at the sombre cadence they needed to properly convey the weight of the moment.In the end, it was a slow burn with no payoff unless we get a second season with some serious action.

"First, if you like a bit of intelligent sci-fi, this is for you. I nearly skipped 3 Body Problem because the write-up and reviews suggested it was going to be awful. I am very pleased that I eventually jumped into this. Yes, it is TV that is mostly rooted in some hard science. But it's a TV programme about super advanced aliens on their way to conquer Earth. So, and like all sci-fi, you are going to have to suspend your disbelief. I saw one review moaning that 3 Body Problem was not realistic because there was a 30-something woman who was a Professor of physics. I actually know a 30-something woman who is a Professor of physics.Second, the cast is superb. There are some old and new faces, and not one of them dials it in. It's an ensemble of talent. I would like to see more of Marlo Kelly, she looks like someone who can play an evil psycho really well. John Bradley and Adrian Edmondson rock, of course.The location filming takes the cast all round the world, the only minor gripe is the CGI. When it is there, the CGI is cumbersome. But the locations, costumes and sets are great. The time needed to get to know the characters is not there, so some of the more emotive scenes don't resonate as much as they could. But for an eight episode season, that's a minor gripe.The story is quite complicated, and you do need to pay attention. The early episodes can be a little confusing as they jump around a bit. But all is explained and eventually makes sense. The second half of the season is more-or-less linear. I haven't read the books, so don't at all care if they are faithful to them. I just want to be entertained, and 3 Body Problem does just that.",IMDB,"Smart, intelligent sci-fi",9.0
"Compared with the TV series ""The Three-Body Problem"" filmed by Tencent in mainland China, Netflix's ""The Three-Body Problem"" integrates the plots of ""The Three-Body Problem"" parts 1, 2 and 3, and the adaptation is very creative and differentiates from the original work. It has strong logic and appreciation at the same time. It is a pity that the visual effects are not satisfactory and do not perform as well as they should, and it does not give people a refreshing feeling. Moreover, the original readers from mainland China seem to have great complaints about this TV series. However, due to the lack of film and television content censorship, Netflix's ""The Three-Body Problem"" better restored the fragments of the ""Cultural Revolution"" and also gave the important character Ye Wenjie in the story a fuller behavioral motivation. Other than that, it doesn't have many advantages, but it is still an important addition to the ""Three-Body"" series of changes.",IMDB,A film above the passing line but not perfect,6.0
"This television series appears to be based on the Chinese author Liu Cixin's The Three Body Problem (2008) that later became a Chinese movie in 2023 and likely the English translation by Ken Liu (2014) which won a Hugo Award. The plot switches between the terrifying event during Chinese Cultural revolution and later to the present day with the mysterious death of scientists around the around as well as involving the actual dilemma of predicting the orbital paths of three bodies in space. The Netflix first season is powerful and at times captivating but at the same time concluding with a disappointing inconclusive ending. One of the most original science fiction portrayals in years, 3 Body Problem has some problem with pacing in places, one or two unnecessary subplots, the earlier semi-light tone quickly darkening in later episodes, and a few scenes that really don't much rational sense that perhaps were included more for dramatic effect unlike the more consistently, scientifically, and practically filmed Interstellar (2014). The group ensemble seems less focused and compelling than those found in The Magician (2005) and Threshold (2005) television series and less dynamic than the multi-faceted sci fi television series Fringe (2008). Other outstanding movies with an alien, time themes include The Arrival (2016), the Fountain (2006), and the cult classic Slaughterhouse Five (1972). Nevertheless this series includes some of the most exotic visually titillating set designs and eerie ominous alien features that make the series stand out at times and worth experiencing along with some high emotionally intense dynamics and intimately personal turmoil among characters.

Much of the series felt underexplored, a lot of peoples actions or attitudes didn't feel properly motivated, and none of the super scientists felt like people who understand relativistic physics.

You can learn a lot more about these topics from Fraser Cain, SciShow, Elderfox Documentaries, Anton Petrov, Cool Worlds, Dr Becky, Dreksler Astral, Geographics, etc... and to go beyond that Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Brian Cox, Frank Drake, Vera Rubin, Michio Kaku, etc...Loads of DEI that is deforming the perception of art, brainwashing people into accepting mediocrity in contemporary media, and ultimately encouraging conformity to the point where opinions in the minority are frowned upon because they don't meet a societal standard. A sensible way to actually embrace cultural diversity/variety is to travel, reflect, express gratitude, continuously improve yourself, find purpose, stay curious, and keep an open mind. Surely this is common sense? Instead what is currently happening is people are blindly accepting mediocrity because it aligns with an agenda, an agenda that is limiting the possibilities of art.Reading other reviews here is quite funny. The people hyping this up have probably seen < 100 films in their life, and < 5 tv-shows in their life, and they're probably hyping up mainstream dross like barbie, oppenheimer, lord of the rings, every batman film, every nolan film, every scorsese film, etc...If you want real profundity in the form of cinema, go watch Avalon, Serial Experiments Lain, Blame!, Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Patlabor 2, Steamboy, Stalker, Involution, instead. Genuine pieces of art that don't pander to the viewer and prioritise atmosphere/style/mood/detail/intimacy over plot and dialogue - unfortunately this will never appeal to the masses because it's easier to talk about plot than it is to talk about atmosphere/style/mood/detail/intimacy.Gradually, year-by-year, I find myself drifting farther and farther apart from mainstream cinema. This is another stepping stone to a personal appreciation for true artistic enlightenment.Disappointing and sadly forgettable. It's not unwatchable, but mostly a waste of time and money.

"It's not perfect. The pilot is a bit clunky, a few of the actors regularly struggle with their lines (or seem to be just miscast - particularly Liam Cunningham as Wade) and there are obvious plot holes, some of them scientific. None of this matters because there are more than enough good ideas to keep you entertained and eventually addicted. This includes using the Sun to communicate with aliens, an advanced VR game that tests and filters out unworthy candidates and a breakaway religious sect with their own doomsday prophecy. All of this is connected by a story that spans decades and explained through well-written, engaging characters with the fresh, energetic pace of a modern episode of Dr. Who. Three Body Problem is one of the most original and imaginative sci-fi series that's come along in a while. More is definitely needed - let's hope they don't flog it to death.",IMDB,Highly recommended,8.0
"I loved it and i was hooked from the start. I also loved the original way of invading a planet, instead of the regular laser guns who go pew pew.Now i see many people in the review section hating the personality of Augie, the prettiest female character. I can say i would bet everything that those complaints are only coming from men, who only like to see pretty girls being flirty and docile. If she was a man, there would be almost no complaints for being so ferm, firey and for agressively swearing...All i saw was a strong smart female who was really ferm, did not accept no for an answer, who put clear bounderies for herself. Sure sometimes she is too firey but i see so many male characters in movies or series who are exactly like that or much much more intense and nobody complajnts about them. Females like this do exist, but unfortunatley not many. We should have more like her cuz its normal...but i know some men can not comprehend that. She doesnt really smile in the entire series, so its ridiculous to see men who wrote reviews basically saying to her ""you should smile more. You would be more pretty that way...and more sufferable"".. like wtf how stereotipical can you be?

"I have not read the original book. I am a sci-fi fan. I like the aspects of the story of 3 body problem that try to examine the contact of extraterrestrial life in terms of the science behind, the philosophy of life, the social economic dynamic and the impact from existential threats. But almost the examination of every aspect lacks depth and coherence. The connections between people are forgettable.The questions the characters sometimes ask make them look like they are not very well educated or deep thinkers although they are scientists.A few key science concepts it employs are so important for the plot yet still wrong or very implausible, which makes it less of a hard science fiction, more like forced so that it may appear interesting to laymen for quick fun or for excitement.Also there are many scenes seem to be very handwaving and not useful to propel the narrative or serious for such a serious attempt.The CGI is not great.

"A really enjoyable and fairly thought provoking Show. Whilst not as expansive as Foundation on Apple it's still very much worth a viewing. Most of the actors do a very good job, especially Benedict Wong, Jess Hong, John Bradley and Alex Sharp. The only misfire seems to be the casting of Eliza Gonzalez which in my opinion isn't a good fit for the role. She just appears to have been chosen for her looks and it's a little inconceivable that someone like this would be in the role of a world leading physicist. But this is a minor point and nothing that spoils the quality of the show.With all book adaptations there will be people giving the Show one star because it doesn't live up to their expectations. There's an easy way around this, which is to look at the spread of scores and discount those with very low scores for example scoring one. Then look at where the majority of the remaining scores are and this will be a true reflection of the quality of the show, Three body problem is more accurately scoring at around 8 out of 10. Definitely recommend and worth a viewing, unless of course you've read the books and then it's the worst show in the world apparently ha ha.",IMDB,"Not the best, but still very, very good",8.0
"The 3 Body Problem earns 7 bags of popcorn and you should probably eat that pop soon before the Ashantis arrive to take all our popcorn.I think the acting was phenomenal, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The story began kind of like Hmmmmm then the story was like Huhhhhh and then I was Oh My Gosh this is so stupid but in the end the story was like Alright Alright.That being said, I got some questions, okay. First of all, they established that this alien civilization is located on a planet that is part of a three star system. They also establish that humans advanced at a faster rate because we didn't have the issue of having to start over. This is why they need to occupy Earth.This is all very confusing. These aliens are so advanced yet the only planet they could find to support their life is Earth? And that was only after receiving our radio signals. We've identified multiple planets that are ""earth"" like and could probably support life but this advanced civilization was sitting waiting for a solution to fall in their laps.My other struggle I have with this whole story line is how this civilization advanced as much as they did. When they said humans advanced faster than them because their civilization essentially keeps getting reset or halted because of the chaotic and destructive nature of being in a three star system. However, they make it sound like humans advanced so fast but last time I checked, earth is over 4 billion years old. To say we arrived where we are because of hundreds of thousands of years of humanity is kinds of ignoring the billions of years that came before us.So going off of that line of thinking, how the heck did this civilization not only advance to where life can flourish and develop into an intelligent species but also advance to the point where they can travel through space and also do the other shenanigans they do in the show? Shouldn't their planet have been flung into a sun or ejected into empty space? Makes no sense to me that they can assert that they developed slower than humans because of the chaotic nature of their home environment yet survived long enough to develop their advance civilization that apparently is also helpless in locating other planets unless that planet says hello first.Also young people don't smoke cigarettes anymore. Why aren't these characters vaping? Cause it looks stupid? I don't know. Also they murdered a bunch of crazy religious people on a cruise for no reason. Straight up cut them to shreds, kids and all. That's messed up, and don't tell me that's the point of the scene. Absolutely ridiculous.Anyways, I did enjoy the show, except for the middle episodes, but I thought it ended strong. So go watch it.

This is the type of show that could easily have at least 2 more seasons, as a writer, with possibly jumping generations ahead, but still going back in time to the main characters and generations before.If there was a season two I would've been fine with the current ending leaving things open ended.In the final episode the story had no conclusion except for a couple of character endings.

"Translating a complex Sci-Fi book with abstract concepts and make it engaging is a mind boggling task at the least. I'm glad to say the series has done its level best to visualise it. It's captivating, dumbs down the scientific concepts involved AND keeps it interesting. Though not all elements are brought onto the screen, it's understandable, compared to the genre difference between GOT and 3BP. At the end of episode 8, I was craving for more. The stark balance between science and the human emotions is thought proving. Season 1 ending made me crave for more of the story to be brought to the screen.To the reviews which state the series is not true to the source material, honestly, it's an unrealistic expectation considering the concepts and the grand scale of the series. It's a catch-22. Making the series too complicated alienates the casual viewership thus reducing the chances of an another season. Making a lean version of the series potentially leads to low ratings from the book readers. Considering the source material's complexity to get it on screen, I for one, would vouch for more seasons with the core concepts of the books being unchanged while taking the creative liberties needed to ensure the series gets it's due closure!",IMDB,A great show!,9.0

I think it was specifically designed this way to set the stage for the complex plot. If you are patient and continue with the series, it becomes increasingly interesting. There are technologically satisfying scenes and other heart touching ones. The characters are well portrayed.It is a production that I wish I had read the book first. There is also a 30-episode Chinese adaptation of the book called ""San - Ti"" that the audience liked it more but I plan to stick to the new version for now.

"First let's be VERY VERY CLEAR about this - it's no Game of Thrones, whether you take the title music or richness of characters or the world building, or the powerful storylines etc etc it's not even close to being a shadow of the Game of Thrones.The sad reality of how Netflix wants to drive streaming is short, punchy, rapid fire, binge streaming model in where there is no time to really develop anything, and if the viewer does not finish the series in one setting then that is taken as reason enough to cancel future seasons!!!!Therefore without giving away any spoilers the show reveals everything at the end of episode 1, everything happens at breakneck speed, and no one is given any time to think or savor anything at all - just keep bingeing episode after episode.The net result is perfect for the current ADD-infested social media driven generation, each scene makes its point in maybe 3-5 seconds, characters make superficially profound utterances in a few words, you unquestionably absorb whatever is presented, give your superficial thumbs up or whatever to the glossy exhibits presented to you and you move on.This is shallow glitzy low brow entertainment at its best and the so-called veneer of science is laughable for anyone who has bothered to even spend more than a few minutes with abstract physics and philosophical questions.For the rest of you - it's an awesomely shallow whoo-hoo roller coaster style entertainment that requires you to leave your brain and skepticism at home and breathlessly accept and enjoy it all - and for such a low bar it's great value for money and time .......enjoy!!!!!",IMDB,Breathless and shallow but enjoyable......however no Game of Thrones this,10.0
"When I read that Netflix had acquired the rights and were going to be making 3 Body Problem, I was concerned at exactly how this would be accomplished considering how massive in scope and complexity the books are. I have read all three books, and all I can say is bravo. They have managed to bring it across to an English audience, simplify the science and render some of the incredibly tricky scenes and ideas onto the television screen in a slick and sublime way. Sure, they've split and converted some of the characters to different nationalities and sexes, but that was obviously going to happen, and it would be naive to expect the showrunners to do a page-by-page adaptation. Without spoiling anything, I was stunned at how well the Panama Canal scene was handled and I am now absolutely confident that we will be blown away by future seasons. If you have read the books and wondered how they can possibly adapt what is going to happen into something that will work for television, then hopefully Season 1 has addressed some of those concerns. It has for me, and I cannot wait for Season 2.",IMDB,Great Adaption for a Western Audience,6.0

While being called ""lord"" which they clearly aren't.Saul survives and murder attempt as the Shan-ti control 3 autonomous cars, but when they fly him to the UN they can't control and crash the plane, which later, in another scene, they can.That is just a few of them are very obvious.But if you put your mind at a low level, it is enjoyable enough,",IMDB,Flawed,8.0

I would also like to watch the Chinese television series. Of course, since it is a Netflix production, a lot has changed. I did a little research, and I believe it was well adapted. The mystery is solved by the second or third episode, at least according to me, but the series was generally enjoyable with the exception of a few episodes. The acting was not bad; I liked it. The script was adequate, and the director's work was good. The visual effects were sometimes good, sometimes bad, but never terrible. Overall, I really enjoyed this series.

"I was pretty hyped awaiting this series, but the reality didn't live up to expectations. For sure, it's significantly above the majority of sci-fi mediocrity released nowadays; but it became underwhelming quite quickly.Most of the CGI was splurged in the first few episodes; which left the remainder of the series as little more than endless talking. Playing suspenseful music alone doesn't make talking more dramatic.The underlying story is quite interesting and novel. It wasn't as formulaic as many contemporary sci-fi/drama series are. However, it wasn't really translated well onto the small screen.Having watched the whole series, I can't say that I'm buzzing to see how the next season pans out. Hopefully it'll be a little more balanced and have some action to spice things up.From the trailers, I thought this was potentially going to be my favourite series of the year.

Perhaps the VR game shouldn't have been depicted in such a lighthearted manner, as it serves to illustrate the lengths to which a civilization will struggle for survival.

But the part that annoys me the most is that so many of the key people all happen to know each other or are in relationships, or just plain related, most of them the stereotypical super smart twenty somethings.

"Almost all of the science in the book is missing from this ""science"" fiction adaptation. For example, the countdown that is introduced in the first few minutes of the show is treated as a serious and explainable phenomenon in the book and Chinese adaptation of the book. The main character does a lot of different experiments to determine how real the countdown is and what kind of limitations it has. For those that have read the book, you'll be sorry to hear that all of the camera experiments have been removed from the show. The main character just randomly sees a countdown at a karaoke bar (no, I'm not kidding!)I don't understand how any of the 10 star reviews can honestly say this is even a remotely accurate representation of the source material.

"First I'm glad the major networks are investing in SciFi which has been a backwater for the last couple decades. I also think this is the best SciFi television show since Westwood S1/Expanse S1,S2.I loved the premise, especially the first few episodes. Unfortunately the show gets gummed up in the later half by spending too much time on the characters, odd priorities for the characters, and not spending enough time on backstory.For example, why can't the San-Ti use their protons to start wiping out people they don't like instead of using half-baked assassins? They can control every television screen on the planet and impact machinery (I think), so why not start crashing planes of anyone they want dead. Why not start killing more scientists? There might be answers to these but the show does a super poor job of explaining the backstory.I also had a hard time following character incentives and decisions, they were so moody and mopey for the fate of humankind to be on the line.The show is at its best either when having action go down or getting into human nature. I loved the judgement day ship episode precisely because it was so uncomfortable and welded SciFi with painful morality decisions.Finally, I wish D&D had written every episode instead of just half the show. If there is a season 2 they really need to keep their foot on the gas and not outsource any of the writing, this season felt disjointed at times and lacked a lot of backstory and hand-holding for SciFi.Overall enjoyed it and hope more is coming.",IMDB,"Pretty Good, Less Characters, Needs More Backstory",8.0
I never read the book so I do not know if this adaptation follows the book. 5 Episodes in I find the plot interesting and there are enough mystery in the show to keep me entertained. The series is fast moving so it masks some of plot holes and cringey scenes. There are enough revelations in each episode to keep me hooked and continue watching.I don't have a problem with the actors protraying the scientists. The actors appeared confident and were mostly convincing when explaining scientific stuff. However I find the romantic stuff between 2 sets of leads cringey. The actress protraying Jin Cheng lacks charisma and I failed to see why the handsome navel officer and the other lead are so besotted with her. The other brilliant scientist Saul is fine but he does not have much to do after the first 2 episodes. E.g.

I was lucky enough to see some of this early at SXSW festival. From what I saw so far it's really great. It changes a few things but overall it was very well made. It still retains many of the themes of the original and the cast is really good. I highly recommend this. Much better than most of the same old sci-fi stuff that usually gets made. The open first few minutes are brutal but done very well. The scale of this show feels very global and has this sense of underlying cosmic dread running throughout.

That's a problem, no one grabbed me enough to remember them. As the episode evolved the science was interesting but the characters and situation became less so. I really dislike that it started with a scientific problem that needed to be solved and turned into a race to stop something totally lame from happening.

If it's based on a book not every movie/show has to be loyal to the books, it just could be a different or altered version of it or there'll be some changes or some deficiencies because books are way too detailed and they need to get rid of some things to simplify and fit it into 8 episodes.

Try to be a little open-minded, if not then maybe you should just stick to your books 'cause I've rarely seen where the audience actually liked an adaptation of a show or a movie that's based on a book.",IMDB,One of the best sci-fi shows I've seen in a while,4.0
A really great adaption of the books. It remained true to the cerebral trippy Sifi of the original while remaining accessible to a new audience. It's clear that the writers have really considered the full 3 book arc (which acts more as an anthology) in how they pull in characters and events from the 2nd and 3rd books to make a cast for TV capable of running the full narrative.If I had one small criticism it's that in the books the global efforts behind the events of the story feel really prominent and this only becomes tangible in the last episode or two.It ends in an exiting way to set up what comes next. Can't wait for season 2!,IMDB,Pulls from all 3 books in a really smart way to create a fantastic adaption,10.0
The book is one of the best Science Fiction novels I have ever read. Unfortunately the series tried to westernize it too much. Specifically changing the lead character Wang to Auggie maked no sense and ruined it for me. Why do this? Again why? Is it just to get a female lead? It totally ruined it for me.Also moving the setting from China to London? In the books Wang is an academic who is developing nano tech and also becomes a lead player in the sim. Netflix version rearraged so much around this character it just fell flat. If they had keot Wang as he was depicted in the novels instead of rewriting him into an attractive female it would have been a lot better series.,IMDB,Changes in lead character was a drag on this adaptation,6.0
"This is an outstanding sci-fi, probably one of the best sci-fi stories ever! The story has science loosely based on our current understanding of astrophysics and quantum mechanics. Most characters are likable if you are not a racist as it has many Asian american characters who are usually not popular for american viewers. The actings are quite good and the production made a somewhat awkward writing into something much easier to follow. Some of the science and engineering are quite radical but have been proposed in real life. Many people who probably failed physic and other science classes probably won't enjoy this show.",IMDB,One of the best sci-fi ever if you have enough brain cells to understand the science,10.0
"Addressing racism in movies is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been present throughout the history of cinema. While some films have effectively tackled racism with nuance and sensitivity, others have perpetuated harmful stereotypes and reinforced systemic prejudices.Positive examples include movies like ""Selma,"" which chronicles the Civil Rights Movement with authenticity and respect for its subject matter. Similarly, ""12 Years a Slave"" unflinchingly portrays the brutality of slavery while highlighting the resilience of its protagonist.Conversely, there are films that have faced criticism for their insensitive portrayal of race. These movies often rely on harmful stereotypes or depict minority characters in one-dimensional roles, perpetuating harmful tropes and contributing to the normalization of racism.It's crucial for filmmakers to approach the subject of race with care, authenticity, and a willingness to challenge societal norms. Diversity in both casting and storytelling can lead to more nuanced and inclusive representations on screen, fostering empathy and understanding among audiences.Ultimately, the depiction of racism in movies can serve as a powerful tool for sparking conversations and promoting social change, but it requires a thoughtful and responsible approach from filmmakers.",IMDB,Same as usual.,10.0
"There is so much dross on streaming services lately, I was literally just about to cancel my Netflix subscription when I saw this show pop up. It's really good, I just wish they would tackle more of the alien side, their lives, the technology they are using etc..and leave the earthly personal, human, drama alone. Maybe its just me but I get sick of romance and love and all the usual human emotions in shows. We sci fi lovers want more of the sci fi aspect please !!! That's why we watch it, if we wanted to watch love and romance we would watch romantic comedies etc..We sci fi lovers have been let down by Netflix so badly over the last 8 years, there are so many great shows that have been dropped or not continued, makes you wonder why they are doing them in the first place.

"Suffering from the disease of many shows today, it waxes lyrical and over complicates the story for the sake of extending the tale beyond reasonable levels.

I absolutely loved this show being a sci-fi fan. It was thought provoking and the special effects were great. I didn't know about the books until reading all the reviews. I'm assuming any score under a 7 would be someone who loved the books in which the show didn't live up to their expectations or that they focused on 1 or 2 things they didn't like. Go into it with an open mind and you'll dig it. The whole premise and main story behind it all is great.

Set 20+ years ago maybe but not in 2024. The other criticism is the barrage of the F word. It's like the script writers are totally incapable of expressing any emotion without using it.

"Ok, I haven't read the book but from what I understand the 5 scientists are a new fabrication by the showrunners to replace what was originally one character. The result is....appalling. Whilst Benedict Wong and Thomas Wade steal every scene they are in and the overarching story is interesting, they are surrounded by a bunch of millennial cohorts we are repeatedly told are geniuses, amazing, stunning and brave but who demonstrate nothing but narcissm, arrogance and stupidity in everything they actually do or say? Will (weak and whiny), Jin (pretentious and arrogant), Saul (miscast and entirely unbelievable as a supposedly charming pot smoking womaniser), Auggy (narcissistic and deeply unlikable without showing any ability to have created what she is said to have created), Jack (cringe and completely unfunny though had an impressive drum kit). It's like the writers/producers got the book and went ""this is great, but you know what be even greater? US and our empty hollywood circle of friends as self-inserts and twisting the story to current day intersectional politics"".

"I read the book and yes, it's amazing! But I have zero qualms about the tv show trimming down some of the fat and adjusting things for the screen version. Expecting anything else is just childish.We live in an age where majority of tv shows barely make it to season 2, so of course the writers are moving things along at an accelerated pace. They do not have the luxury of unlimited page numbers, especially considering the season 1 is only eight episodes long.With that said, I found the show to be extremely well produced, with top notch visuals and excellent and engaging storytelling. The cast is for the most part a good fit for their characters, with Asian actors especially standing out in their performances, which will definitively appeal to the audiences in the east.What I really liked is the world building. We get an incredibly vivid sense of the world and jumping between Asia, Europe and USA, definitively helps appreciate the scale and gravity of the events unfolding. At moments it feels as if we're watching a global blockbuster movie.A lot of the philosophycal and existential questions are posed and if you enjoy your brain getting tickled by large topics, this will be very enjoyable.",IMDB,"Ignore the book worms, this is excellent sci-fi!",6.0
"I haven't read the source material so come at with a fresh perspective. I'm about halfway through and will watch until the end, purely because I love sci-fi. If not for that, I may not have finished it because the quality of both the writing and performances is sub par. I care little for any of the characters. They're not interesting or engaging. Even Benedict Wong seems a little off in it, and he's an excellent actor. Here, he has strange, rather forced accent. At times, it feels like some of the other characters voices have been dubbed, so wooden are they. Overall, I'd recommend it if you enjoy sci-fi. If not, I'd give it a miss.",IMDB,Interesting premise with poorly drawn and uninteresting characters.,10.0
"But I have questions.The first revolves around the main conceit of the narrative. Why are the aliens worried about humans outpacing them regarding technology over the next 400 years?The San-Ti are supposedly a race that has mastered faster-than-life travel for their multi-dimensional omniscient proton-sized supercomputers that can unfold to cover the entirely of the atmosphere and surface of Earth with blanket omniscient surveillance.I think the plot is giving humans way more credit for their industrial advancements than what is actually capable even by current exponential projections on improvements in science over the time frame needed here.I am just not buying that we are a threat to an alien population that has conquered hard and fast rules of physics. Unless the San-Ti are exceptionally dumb and can be killed by the common cold or something as simple as water. I mean that would just be outright goofy sci-fi of them to invade if that were the case.Also, who was the awful casting person in charge of giving Alex Sharp a role in this show? He is downright terrible. There is nothing about his character that I liked seeing, hearing, experiencing in any way.I think it is a good show with lots of good ideas. I just have issues with its overall internal logic and premise (and that one actor). I would hate to think B&B are making things up as they go along. That didn't work so well in that dragony, gamey, throney project they ruined not too long ago.I will keep watching this show to see if things are eventually explained. Also, please don't resurrect Dowling with the same actor, San-Ti. You don't deserve Earth if you do.",IMDB,It's definitely entertaining.,6.0
"Season 1 of 3BP felt quite refreshing for me, as most of the stuff we see these days feel overdone and recipe -driven. I don't read or watch a lot of hard sci-fi, so I'm not sure how original the ideas in the books actually are, but they were definitely a treat for me.As someone who did science at uni, I immediately noticed how unlikely or implausible some of the scientific concepts were. Despite this, I really enjoyed the creative and imaginative ideas. It's the kind of creativity and imagination that sparks further curiosity and thought from the viewer. Although many real science concepts are used to serve the heavily technological basis of the story, the plot mainly revolves around existential and social elements.The series is well-paced, making it easy to follow and gets you more hooked as pieces of the puzzle fall together with story progression. If you like sci-fi, I highly recommend this show.",IMDB,"Interesting, thought provoking, and more",10.0

Even if there was a season 2 i'm not sure id be interested because this show really struggles to get the pacing right which means you're not sure if you're going to get a good pay off or not.

"It's an ok TV show which looks great and can be entertaining if you are looking for a light sci-fi. If you want a tv show that focuses on science instead of relationship drama, then the chinese version might be a better option for you.While the chinese version went slowly through the plot (ok, maybe too slow), giving characters and ideas time to evolve, in the Netflix adaptation the main plot seems to be rushed and, what bothers me most, is that the science is treated superficially. For some reason, they decide to show a weird dinner discussion full of cliché instead of how one of the main characters learns through multiple iterations how to solve a level in the game. Whenever the characters solve a piece of the puzzle it feels empty, there's no pay-off because you don't follow their thought process, you are just presented the result.The chinese version reminded me why I used to love math and physics in school.

I personally think this has striked a perfect balance of respecting the original work while blendings in elements that are novel and exciting to the modern day audience.Especially excited about the featuring of multiple less well-known (and ethnic) actors.

In my opinion, it should ended at episode five and the rest of series could be in season two.

I watched hundreds of Shows this is my honest review. The good Things are the Special effects real Clean but Not outstanding good. The Bad Things are the Story never seems to draw me in this world all People Kinda Like whatever No Actors was outstanding except Wade the Boss or Auggy but Most of the time WE have Dialogue who are boring for an sci fi expert. The Show trys to build Up tension but failes all the time except on Episode 5 this one IS the best but Kinda real sick. There are somethings Missing for a great Show to be so i care for their world and People its Like fast food Looks good but Bad stuff in it. But the Actors are Not their fault the Story is Mediocre written iam getting barely suprised because everything what happens gets Linear build Up or IS predict able. Alot of Potential but Not used iam Missing the Soul and Heart in IT probally would be better If it was a 1 Season Show. This Show is the Most dissapoiting this Year.

"As a fervent enthusiast of the sci-fi genre, I am constantly on the lookout for new and captivating narratives that push the boundaries of imagination.3 Body Problem, a series adapted from a foreign novel, emerged as a revelation, delivering an unparalleled viewing experience that ranks among the greatest within recent memory. From the very first episode, it became abundantly clear that this was not your average sci-fi fare. Its rich and intricate storytelling, rooted in the complexities of Liu Cixin's acclaimed novel, was masterfully brought to life on screen. The production value, attention to detail, and visual effects seamlessly transported viewers into a world brimming with mystery, intrigue, and wonder. One of the standout aspects of 3 Body Problem is its meticulously crafted characters. Each protagonist is fleshed out with depth and complexity, allowing viewers to form genuine connections and empathize with their struggles and triumphs. Whether it's the brilliant yet tormented scientist grappling with existential dilemmas or the enigmatic figures shrouded in mystery, every character leaves a lasting impression, adding layers of depth to an already compelling narrative. Moreover, the series is a testament to the power of intricate plotting.3 Body Problem weaves together multiple storylines with finesse, effortlessly interconnecting past, present, and future to create a tapestry of intrigue that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The intricate web of plots and subplots unfolds with precision, revealing surprising twists and turns that challenge preconceived notions and defy expectations. As a longtime aficionado of the genre, I can confidently say that 3 Body Problem stands tall as a pinnacle of sci-fi storytelling. Its ability to seamlessly blend thought-provoking concepts with pulse-pounding action is a testament to its brilliance. Rarely does a series come along that leaves such a profound and indelible impact, and is undoubtedly one of them.In conclusion, 3 Body Problem is a tour de force that deserves the highest praise. With its stellar performances, intricate plotting, and breathtaking visuals, it is a must-watch for anyone with a discerning palate for quality storytelling. I wholeheartedly give it a perfect 10 out of 10 and recommend it to all aficionados of the genre.",IMDB,A Masterpiece of Sci-F - 3 Body Problem Delivers a Mind-Blowing Experience.,9.0

Benedict Wong and Kevin Eldon are just enough to make the show a star parade. I wish there were no actors from game of thrones though. Game of thrones was too long too much and the producers sweated it to a sickening point. Now everytime I see someone from game of thrones I get that sickening feeling. I am only two episodes into the series and I am not sure how the story will develop but the Tiananmen square and the red guards and China being portrayed like nazi Germany makes me think this show pleases those who want to ban tik tok. Is China the new Russia now? The evil empire?Sky flickering and nobody really caring too much about it is a bit underwhelming.

"3 body problem is a book trilogy that details an advanced alien civilisations intent to conquer earth but far from being easily digestible; the original content is cerebral and nihilistic - def not fit for general tv consumption.

This adaption is mediocre; from the bad casting, bad acting, bad cgi and overall choices of what to include/exclude from the source material. The season ends with wel, a whimper.

Finally a very good Netflix show. I have not read the book and this is my first introduction. Thought provoking as it looks at many of the elements that affect our lives. How humans are responsible for destroying each other and environment and many issues inverted. Some of the characters are brilliant others not so. It's quite scary from the 2nd episode the pace is quicker and a lot more action. I'm only half way in and if you have a chance to watch ..do it. There is a lot of science which is great.Fascinating. There are certain stories that can truly be described as epic. I found both the premise and the series intriguing and thought provoking.

"I was initially put off when I saw how much it deviated from the original storyline in the first few episodes. Was looking for Wang Miao (male lead character of book 1) and realised Auggie was meant to be him. Multiple plotlines were over-generalised and characters condensed to fit into the Netflix 8-episode format. However, there were some entertaining merits to the way the story was tweaked, which comes across as an attempt to make it more bite-sized (or dumbed-down) for audiences that have not read the books. Several of the key plots in the second and third books (which were meant to happen in different time periods) were mashed into this first season, which does not do the full story justice, since it is meant to span centuries.Ultimately I do feel entertained though, as this series took out some dramatic parts of the books to play out using the Hollywood machinery, with the downside of ignoring several other character plots that were essential the whole plot. The character of Luo Ji for example, was only revealed to be congruent to Saul in the last episode, and the whole transition felt like a desperate attempt to mish mash every actor's importance to draw relevance to the trilogy's readerbase.I hope season 2 onwards can start to veer back more to the original storyline.",IMDB,"It's definitely a Netflix entertainment vehicle, but..",7.0
The first book is hard to make in to a series but I think the first 8 episodes was pretty good. This series goes bananas in the second book so I really hope we get a second season.Lots of changes in this adaptation but It makes more sense for a western version.Great job with cgi and casting. The story is kind of slow but it grows into a terrifying nightmare. And ends a bit early. I would have like too see the time jump of the second book in the end.I guess they could have told about the Dark Forest Hypothesis. That would have made more sense in the end. But for being a Netflix series this is the best series they made in years.,IMDB,A great start in the trilogy.,9.0
"The best parts of the series were episodes two to five. After the destruction of the cruise ship ""Judgement Day"" , the plot became increasingly strange. Characters started doing their own things, significant decisions happened without any build-up, and there was a pervasive sense of inexplicable sadness throughout.There's a major contradiction: the Trisolarans will arrive on Earth in 400 years, which seems distant, so people are likely to continue with their lives as usual. However, the director needed to fill three episodes, clearly struggling to find sufficient content, leading to a poor viewing experience reminiscent of students padding out their essays.A good topic for discussion would be the extent of sacrifices people should make for an event 400 years in the future. Some would support immediate preparation, while others prefer to live their normal lives, likely causing disputes. For example, Auggie believes in minimal sacrifices and is upset over the death of many innocents on the Judgement Day. However, this topic is merely touched upon and then dropped. Auggie's drunken ranting seemed more like background noise than a meaningful contribution, leading to a disjointed narrative lacking clear directorial intent or conflict.The romantic subplot between Will and Cheng Jin was also lackluster, repeated many times yet remaining dull. The audience is left clueless about Will's attraction to Cheng Jin, as it's taken for granted. Without the necessary details, it's hard for the audience to empathize with their relationship. Thus, Will's failed confession in London and their subsequent time together did little to evoke emotion. More scenes depicting the development of Will's feelings for Cheng Jin, even from the past, would have added depth to his struggles.Furthermore, the Trisolarans' abandonment of the Earth's Trisolaran organization, and Auggie not having a countdown in his eyes when he restarted his research, were puzzling. The Trisolarans justified their actions by claiming humans are inherently deceitful, making their reconnection with certain humans illogical, as these humans are also capable of lying. Perhaps these individuals proved their loyalty to the Trisolarans, but the reasoning remains unconvincing, given the Trisolarans' fear of human deceitfulness which is inherent in human gene.The introduction of the ""Wallfacers"" was also strange. The concept was introduced before explaining the necessity of hiding intentions from the Trisolarans. This concept is crucial, yet it was mentioned in passing, as if it were trivial. Such a significant concept needed more foundation, allowing the audience to consider its importance and plausibility. A few scenes depicting a human project's failure due to poor secrecy could have helped build this understanding, but such groundwork was lacking.In summary, the director tried to omit some original elements and add his own ideas, which is commendable. However, these new ideas were not thoroughly explored, merely mentioned in passing, and even some original concepts were superficially presented, resulting in a latter half of the series that lacked focus and was unengaging.",IMDB,"They attempted to add new elements, but it failed.",6.0
"I watch on the Chinese version on Rakuten Viki + the Net Flix version. So far into chapter 10 of 30 the Chinese version is quite sinister and delving eventually in to the turbulent ""Culture Revolution"", but not enough to be censored.

So, the Chinese version goes under the radar in the West, weird since it is more true to the original book. For me it would be interesting to see a viewers discussion about the different version.

Plus he's now taking me so serious about ice baths that HE even started doing it, even on Wednesdays when he has to get up extra early for golf cart practice. PLUS, I finally got my chance to say my one liner to Becky yesterday, and it worked so great she said ""please don't ever talk to me again!"" Dave says I should Sue. But I don't know who Sue is, and he didn't say what I am supposed to do, and I don't want to ask him now because he's going to think I was wrong about ice baths.And finally, D, these supposed ""scientists"" used the word ""God"" in a sentence MUTILIPLE times!!!! What are they even smoking!?!? Grass!?PLUS, they kept BORING me even just mentioning the word science like 5 whole times in the episode!! I mean jeez, I like science just like the next guy. (Where do you think I learned all this stuff about ice baths in the first place?) But I mean, everybody has a limit, right? Who do they think I am, Tom Cruise!? And they even had the audacity to have several female scientists in the show, too. Obviously all men know women can't really be scientists, right? At least that one guy showed them up with his singing skills. They didn't even try to sing after that. LOL.Where is my Dune 3 sequel!?End of Rant./sP. S.

"Well I've binged the first four episodes,and requiring sleep,so finish tomorrow,
so far...The cast a few members from GOT,plus next generation
actors,same script writers,so I reckon curiosity dragged viewers in.May investigate the books,one of the actors who is prominent so far
was in another hard science sci-fi movie UFO Alex Sharp..... very thoughtful clever movie,low budget but gripping.Benedict Wong playing a mid character spook with his homegrown Lancashire drawl
Liam Cunningham usual salty language,lot of Anglo-Saxon expletives
from most of the characters,so reminiscent of GOT flavour.I do like the 1960's historical references to the cultural revolution
in China,and the effect of martial law by the military upon the general population.However whoever's in power in history,profit is always on the agenda,all the human aspects of plagiarism,deceit,
and misuse of power.An exercise in futuristic virtual game play is now in use but really an alien recruitment
ploy to get earthling followers and acolytes.Episode 5 is the big reveal,hard science required to solve the riddles
The Alien visitors somehow manipulate the internet,and reveal their existence to the world at large,
using communication hi tech software, light years ahead of Earth
There is great spectacular cgi in this episode,gruesome,and cutting edge....
They will arrive in 400 years........
News clips with our present world leaders shown ...a cheap trick.World leaders then decide to fund the science for new technology.And invest in future science and engineering
But as usual the problem will be someone else's future to solve
The general population are frightened into conformity
The big finale ,the engineering and science fall over,
borrowed heavily from1960's actual science projects ,using nuclear blast propulsion in outer space

"First thing first, if you never read the book, it's not a bad show, some Chinese actors really shine in it but the rest are not much to write home about. The children were pretencious and the writing was a bit lazy. But all in all it's an enjoyable show.If you read the book like I did, you might be put off a little cos it's not exactly how it was in the book, it's way faster paced and of course will skip a few things here and there, the biggest issue is introducing so many new characters NOT from the book, however I understand where the director(s) were coming from - to tell the story in such a pace you need a few different aspects, I also understand the reason why it's fast-paced, as 1, audience nowadays have a short attention span (thanks to all the short vids apps), 2. It costs a lot of money to produce shows like this, and having too many episodes is not economically feasible.2 episodes in and I am actually liking it, so here's a 6.5, hopefully the rest will be better.",IMDB,probably a 6.5 but imdb doesn't give you that option,7.0
"This is going to sound like a rant because it's FRESH. I just finished watching.The first thing to say is that I hate this show because I know it's based on something good.The are genuinely good ideas here which is what kept me watching to the end of the series, but when it finished I was angry with myself for watching it. Those good parts I mention, I can tell are lifted from something good (I've not done enough research to tell what that is yet although I'm aware there is another version) but the characters involved are all that unlikeable you don't care anyway!You can tell this series is teeing up something much bigger for the next, but I for one won't be watching.",IMDB,This show made me genuinely angry.,1.0
"Very well done. The ideas and events in Liu Cixin's series are more important than the characters. That being said, the writers and directors did a phenomenal job compressing the events and ideas of Liu Cixin's first book into season one of 3 Body Problem. They retained the imaginative spirit of the science-grounded novel while introducing characters in a compelling manner. This show will be wildly successful if given the green light to continue to be made high quality despite the price.overall This is the best series of 2024 so far. I can't stress this enough if you have not watch the show yet. Drop what your doing and watch it. It the most original and unique story that I have ever seen.",IMDB,Finally something worth the subscribe to Netflix!,10.0

I had trouble understanding why some of them even existed but sticking through to the end, that was also explained although I'm not sure I felt like it was a good enough reason to keep them on the screen.As much as I hate to say it, probably the books did explain the plot points a little better because I was often thinking....what the huh?!It was ok.

The script the narration the intensity and ultimately the question on existence of humans keeps you glued in an awesome way of storytelling.Loved it and finished in few days. The characters are engrossing and use of human emotions, alien characters and way they all come together is absolutely amazing way of keeping anyone hooked.I loved Saul character as he is intelligent and oblivious of things around him but when pushed into something gets on with it.This series forces you to think human existence and how fragile we are as compared to aliens. In a shuttle way it reminds how fortunate we are to inhabit a planet that is stable enough for our species survival.Loved watching it and can't wait for season 2.",IMDB,Absolutely Phenomenal and Mind Blowing,10.0
"Nobody expects a filmed adaptation of a book to be identical to the book. That's not a realistic expectation.But there is a point at which an adaptation deviates so much from the source material that it's not reasonable to even use the same name. It's just misleading and dishonest. At best this series could have the tagline ""inspired by the stories of Cixin Liu"".If you enjoy this series then good for you, but understand that the majority of the characters have been changed or invented, the locations have changed and many major events are different.This isn't 3 body.

"Love the novel which was the most mind blowing sci-fi i've ever read. It's on a completely new level in terms of sci-fi imaginations and concepts - it's truly unparalleled.This TV show however is a new creation. It is by itself another piece of art based on the novel but with significant changes. After all, TV shows and sci-fi novels have two very different audiences.Netflix did a great job in maintaining the cool sci-fi ideas from the novel and creat more simplified stories lines easier for mass consumption.The novel is too complicated for a TV show so the changes are critical to keep things simple and easy to follow. Plus the acting and scenes are all awesome.The only miss is the special effects - they are so not on par with everything else!But that doesn't stop this being one of the most fascinating shows on netflix for years!! Watch it !",IMDB,Binge watched all 8 episodes and can't wait for Season 2,10.0
"The pilot got me intrigued and most of the characters are likeable. Auggie could have been given a stronger character arc instead of the 'oh I feel bad for killing despite the unique circumstances' since Jin got over the situation quickly undermining it's depravity. With all due respect to the dead, Saul and Will scenes are a bit forceful and slow especially since neither Will's life nor his demise left much of an impression on the characters or the storyline.The VR scenes are bizarre but meaningful and all the special effects are really good.Parting thoughts... why was Wade sadistically left alive and not killed? The alien race can't be both cocky and afraid of 'Earthly' intellect. Why did Wenjie not denounce San Ti when she had the chance? Perhaps cause it wouldn't make a difference, people will follow their biases nonetheless. Why was Tatiana not actively hunted given her intense devotion to San Ti and gory record (this one really bugs me and I can't think of an explanation)?All in all a good show and I will look forward to season 2. Mildly concerned we will see action scenes with funky tech followed by sappy acts of humanity making the aliens question their mission and provide aid against their own kind.:B.",IMDB,"Fast storyline, great effects, thrilling",7.0
"The Chinese Government is most likely the ones downvoting this series into oblivion, I think they're mad that they're being exposed and Netflix for once is actually allowing it.Very unexpected for Netflix to come out with a show like this, controversial, epic, and mysterious, yet both people from the Left and the Right enjoy it, and for good reason!Im on episode 5 and havent been able to stop watching. The cast is superb and the story keeps you wanting more after every episode. Excellent blend of drama, sci-fi and thriller.I am looking forward to many more seasons of this to come!! Great job Netflix.",IMDB,Awesome series!,10.0
"They significantly altered the plot and world-building of The Three-Body Problem.First, the beginning was very promising, suggesting that it turned out well, but no.Instead of the complex mosaic of cultures, characters, politics, etc., they tried to reinvent John Snow with Khaleesi and attempted to compress several different personalities into them. This compression led to occasional inconsistencies in their behavior. Additionally, the complex character development from the book was sacrificed to create a forced love story that ultimately fell flat.Overall, the focus shifted away from the complexities of the modern world to a small, isolated group that didn't truly represent society (since they weren't part of it!).The philosophical elements and scientific theories that were central to the book were also absent. While my primary concerns lie with the script, I believe the core issue is the unsuccessful adaptation.",IMDB,Good Base story - Bad Adapted Screenplay,7.0
"The UN security council should pass a binding resolution banning Benioff and Weiss from adapting anything ever again.I don't understand how you can take such a fascinating story and turn it into such an uninspiring snoozfest. I really rarely use the D-word but in this case ""disappointing"" doesn't even come close to describe the overall experience of watching this mess.The characters are all abundantly silly. The absolute nerds in the original book were transformed into the cliché: ""strong and independent"" women. Why? Their vulnerability was what made them special and the story interesting.The plot moves at a snail's pace.The dialogues are ChatGPT-esque.

"Have you ever wanted a great work of science fiction that actually was up to date?(I'm looking at you H. G. Wells, ""War of the Worlds"" and your cannon fired martians)Well ...the wait is over and this Netflix adaptation of Liu Cixin's ""3-Body Problem"" has covered it ALL with the superior pacing that a few hours of Netflix binge watching can provide. The real shine here is seeing the full budget applied to what is essentially, a 10-hour movie. But I could not stop, only slept and then right back the episode. Eating can wait. It is that good. It is so good, that the fact it ends, is terrible and profound. What's left for me now that I have not Mr. Cixin's story to consume me? I mean, I have become seriously emotionally invested through what I have seen here. But seriously, this is a time they did almost everything right, there was only maybe three times I felt pulled from the story due to bad cinematography, or a little bit wooden acting. Ever seen a REALLY Chinese actress do a make out scene? Eh.....It was awkward and I feel that is not something she was comfortable having filmed. But context of the film it fits and possibly she is just incredible actress?? The fact I'm wondering... hmm but let's not throw expectation pressure on the actors, as thats when we lose amazing performance.Netflix episodic is the only way to cover such a vast range of topics. Psychology, geo-politics, tech, war, transcendence, near LS travel, anthropology, xenology, phylosophy, I mean just all of it, and a 1.5 hour film has always had its hands tied in the realm of sci fi. My beliefhas always been, If it goes beyond one topic in 1.5 hours then we get star trek glooglooglammagon lasers. Where an entirely new world is created before the story can begin, we must give our time for the story. That is the cost, and I pay it GLADLY to NEtflix adaptation of Liu Chen's 3-Body Problem. This is truly a motion picture transcendence, and netflix has DONE IT. It is not your made-for-tv movie or epic or any of that. This is true hollywood cinema, from the comfort of your home on your schedule enabling longer stories to be told. And what a story. The author who created this has my dearest thanks and heartfelt gratitude. All of these amazing scientifc theories and possibilites that have been hobbled by human greed have been presented at least here in our imaginations, and hopefully the dreams of our desendants. That gives me really hope, and for that I believe the futurer may put this as the greatest work of modern science fiction. This is my first intro the works and I have ordered the books, there are four and one book that began as a fanfiction but is revered as quality work. I will be ordering that as well. This is a beautiful and emotional work of our most advanced possibilities as a species, from what I have seen from the adaptation. I cannot wait to grant a greater amount of my time to have an even fuller view into the world of Author, Liu Cixin's incredible mind. I am from the US and I am so glad to see more China, it is 2024 and I am sick of humanix stupidity of not working together. Best original work I have seen in years, as a US citizen I believe this mans background can expose me to something knew and hidden.",IMDB,"Covers all the modern near future tech, cant wait to read",10.0
"If you're familiar with the books this series is based on, and you were able to at least get through the first book (The Three-Body Problem), then there's a good chance you liked that book but won't enjoy this Netflix series. I say this because reading that book can be challenging, not because it's boring or uninteresting, but because the story is so science-heavy and the otherworldly concepts so overwhelming. The most interesting character in the story is Je Wenjie, the link between the past and present and well presented in this TV adaptation. Then there's Wang Miao, a nanotechnology professor and the single protagonist driving most of the story in present day China. Benioff, Weiss (and Netflix) decided to turn this single protagonist into the circle of friends you see in the show, living in present day London. There's a lot of tension, anxiety and paranoia in the book, as the single protagonist, along with detective Shi Qiang, try to figure all these stuff out--it's a lot like reading a Philip K Dick short story. Unfortunately, all this is lost in the TV adaptation. The show creators decided to water everything down for a wider audience by diluting the story concepts and rearranging some of the characters and events. Yes, there's more character depth in this Netflix adaptation, but they often distract from the story rather than driving it. The characters added to the show weren't structured well enough for the story to make sense. What makes the book grandiose and intellectually challenging--from figuring out the three-body phenomena in the virtual game, to the ingenuity aliens and humans use to manipulate or one-up one another--is kind of lost here. You want your audience to figure things out along with the characters, not random characters revealing major plot points for the general audience. Most of the spectacle, secondary characters and major story points are presented well, so if you haven't read the books, this adaptation is probably worth a watch.",IMDB,"Bold, Ambitious but Ultimately Underwhelming Adaptation",6.0
"Enjoyed the first season and not having read the books, the long timeline juxtaposed with the constant surveillance of the aliens is really interesting and unique and so looking forward to seeing how it resolves. One plot point nitpick is the apparently sudden realization of the aliens to humanity's propensity for deception after approximately forty years of contact. Seems very strange.My primary complaint is ridiculous overuse of the F word from the mouths of exactly every single character. It makes it less believable since not everyone uses it every fourth word regardless of age, background, etc.",IMDB,Contemplative Sci Fi,8.0
"Adapted from Liu Cixin's award winning sci-fi novel (that I haven't read, but it's apparently very popular) of the same name, this was a story like nothing else I've watched so far. And on, BTW, it's made by D&D of Game of Thrones, the duo that did a tremendous job until S07 and then screwed it up. There's source material here....sooo...Fans of the sci-fi genre, if you've not watched this show, I'd highly recommend it. Most of the first half of the show the show is nothing short of a spectacle. Big ideas are crammed in but they are convincing enough to pique your curiosity about these ideas. Things don't always make sense but the plot slowly unfolds to reveal what's going on in the 2nd half.A lot of relationships and human centric drama in the 2nd half and I don't know how to feel about it. It wasn't bad but took away from the spectacle, not sure if that's how it was in the books or if liberties were taken to adapt it into a show. Don't know how to feel about a certain direction the plot takes at the end, felt absurd but.... I'll def. Watch S02 if it's made just to get the answers and see what new ideas and sci-fi worlds this show has to offer.",IMDB,Slightly downhill in the 2nd half.,6.0

Now the 1st season is far from perfect but does have it's moments of awesomeness and promises a very bright future. Now this is a series where there is a lot of time jumping back and forth which also requires the viewer to really pay attention to what is going on.

"I would give it 10 stars for the visuals and actors,but for me the storyline was somewhat chaotic and hard to follow.Perhaps the viewer is required to read the book first.The depiction of the red guard era in China was stunning as was the creation of the Chinese transmitting station.The story has obviously much more to tell,apparently it is hoped that a second series will be shown in 2026.This is something that hasn't been confirmed.The time between the series presents its own issues in whether or not there is enough viewer interest to warrant this.I would watch a second series and perhaps I could concentrate more on the storyline and less on the stunning visuals.",IMDB,Great visuals.,6.0
"""3 Body Problem,"" the much-anticipated Netflix series adapted from Liu Cixin's groundbreaking science fiction trilogy, is a visually stunning and intellectually stimulating journey into the depths of the cosmos and the human psyche. With its intricate plotlines, thought-provoking themes, and breathtaking cinematography, the series captivates audiences from start to finish.One of the series' most notable strengths lies in its faithful adaptation of Liu Cixin's complex narrative. Each episode skillfully weaves together multiple storylines, effortlessly transitioning between the present day and various historical periods, creating a rich tapestry of characters and events. From the enigmatic physicist Ye Wenjie to the determined nanomaterials researcher Wang Miao, the characters are brought to life with depth and nuance, making their struggles and triumphs feel both relatable and profoundly significant.At the heart of ""3 Body Problem"" is its exploration of humanity's place in the universe and the ethical dilemmas that arise when faced with the unknown. Themes of morality, progress, and the consequences of scientific discovery are expertly woven throughout the series, prompting viewers to ponder the implications of our actions and the potential ramifications for future generations.Visually, ""3 Body Problem"" is a feast for the eyes. The stunning CGI effects bring to life the alien world of Trisolaris with breathtaking detail, immersing viewers in a world unlike anything they've seen before. From the sprawling cities of the Trisolarans to the majestic landscapes of their home planet, the attention to detail is evident in every frame, creating a sense of wonder and awe that is truly mesmerizing.In addition to its visual splendor, ""3 Body Problem"" also boasts a stellar cast whose performances elevate the material to new heights. From the stoic determination of Wang Miao to the moral ambiguity of the enigmatic Trisolarans, each actor brings their character to life with skill and nuance, drawing viewers deeper into the story with every scene.However, ""3 Body Problem"" is not without its flaws. Some viewers may find the pacing to be slow at times, as the series delves into complex scientific concepts and philosophical debates. Additionally, the non-linear narrative structure may be confusing for some viewers, requiring careful attention to detail to fully grasp the intricacies of the plot.Despite these minor drawbacks, ""3 Body Problem"" is a triumph of science fiction storytelling, pushing the boundaries of the genre and challenging audiences to think deeply about the nature of existence and the mysteries of the universe. With its compelling characters, thought-provoking themes, and stunning visuals, the series is a must-watch for fans of science fiction and anyone who appreciates thought-provoking storytelling at its finest.",IMDB,"""Unlocking the Enigma: A Review of Netflix's '3 Body Problem'""",10.0
"I haven't read the book series but this show was kind of boring and underwhelming. There were good parts illustrating the existential dread but from what I've read the Chinese show did a better job of that.I found none of the characters likable or relatable in any way and I especially found Dr. Salazar as annoying and overly emotional and irrational. It's like the shows are turning into soap operas. I also read that they did some gender swapping to make it politically correct. Why? Could have done without that.Anyway, after I finished watching and saw the show status as 'Ended' which probably means they aren't even renewing it. Save yourself some time and don't bother.

"Not read the book. It's been on my list for a while...I'm completely loving this show. As with anything, It's the characters and performances that drive it along. In that regard, the cast is outstanding. With one exception: Benedict Wong is badly miscast, in my opinion. Eiza Gonzalez also starts off a little on the wooden side, but really seems to grow into the role as the series progresses. All the rest of the main cast give 10/10 performances, with Alex Sharp the pick of the bunch for me.The story is intriguing and keeps you guessing. The science is solid, although I feel the early episodes try and cram in some unnecessary buzzwords like ""Fermi's Paradox"" in order to tick some boxes for those casual science fans, which then have to be explained for the none science fans. Seems a little clumsy in execution.However, those are quibles in what is an otherwise ambitious and brilliantly crafted show.",IMDB,"Mostly great, but occasional misses",8.0
"So, this one is interesting. I have read the books some time ago so I have a reference here and my overall impression is VERY positive.I read people commenting on how the ""scientists"" in the show are unbelievable, because they act like normal people with emotions and do not sit in their lab coats in their basements 24/7. Well, as a real scientist, this is finally a proper representation of us. We are normal people with normal lives like everyone else, we drink, we like to have fun, we are just quite a bit more nerdy than average maybe. I would definitely play some good alien VR game if I could!The show is of course not 100% faithful to the original, but I see what they did and it makes sense. The pacing is faster, characters are a bit different and setting is shifted to the West, but I don't think the show suffers for it. Its different, but good on its own!The diversity in cast and character changes that a lot of people complain about are absolutely irrelevant, as the whole point of Cixin Liu's work is about ideas, science, awe and globe spanning historic events. I couldn't care less if the character is Black, or Caucasian, or woman, or man. The characters are there to drive the narrative, not be the point of the narrative. This is exactly the type of show where more diversity than in original books only helps and hurts no one.While the big reveals are delivered quite fast, they work. I almost wish I did not read the books, as I can see the plot being very captivating for someone with no knowledge of events. And it should only get better.I hope to see this continue. If they manage to go through with this into Book 2 and Book 3, we may be getting some of the best CGI in Sci-Fi, as well as some truly mind bending physics at play.",IMDB,"As a scientist who read the books, I applaud it!",9.0
"I did not read the source novel, so it's difficult to figure out if some of the bad writing is from the novel, a bad translation, or just Benioff and Weiss still thinking they can write. It's frustrating because they can put together a great looking show. They are excellent producers. But they are terrible writers, terrible storytellers.If you overlook the shabby edges, it has an interesting story to tell. Just don't expect too much from it.For example they slice up that boat the get the information they need after dismissing gas and swat teams and all other attacks. No, nano wire is the only thing that can work despite the near certainty that anything they hoped to recover would be either sliced up itself, sink in the canal, or burned in the inevitable fires. Just the communication equipment they were using would have been as valuable as the notes. But they somehow find the few fragile pages they need in tact. And after blocking the entire Panama Canal with the stunt, the whole world would know what's going on.But the whole slicing scene looked cool, so don't overthink it.",IMDB,Troubled but entertaining attempt,6.0
"A great adaption of a great book series. An absolutely vast improvement on the incredibly tedious, bloated and badly acted Chinese version that was released last year.Also, this version isn't tainted by Chinese government propoganda and properly shows the incident with one of the main character's father right at the very start of the show, without censorship, unlike the Chinese version. It's a crucial scene that should should never have been interfered with. This ensures we understand her World view right from the get go.The complex science aspects of this show have been made understandable in a way that makes this show accessible even to people who wouldn't normally read/watch hard sci-fi, and what a great plot it is.Anyway, top marks from me. This is how to adapt difficult source material and condense it into a fascinating 8 part show.",IMDB,Great adaption,10.0
"The fun thing about it is as each episode passes, it gets more interesting so the building of suspense and thrill is working. The characters are likeable and the plot is enjoyable.On the flip side, why does every character have to be a different race? Was this a box Netflix had to check off?Most of the acting is bad or cliche at best, or the actors are good just the lines they're given are hard to work with. Everyone sounds like the same person. Benedict Wong is a likeable character, but not a convincing cop. However, Jess Hong felt like the most natural actress, and she just gets more beautiful every episode.I wish people would make more tv series with scenes that stay with the conversation rather than being one liners then cutting to the next situation, leaving us feeling safe that we didn't have to stick around for the awkward but important character building conversatoins.

"This was & is one of the best shows ive seen so far!. Seriously i agree with whoever said it, it's not like any other sci-fi series!. Though i do admit, the later episodes were a bit too slow and dragged alot. But the show was still awesome! Especially my most favorite girl ever... eiza gonzalez and her character auggie salazar!. Not only they own their scenes, they completely owned the whole @#%& show! From first to last episode. And i love enjoyed every single second of eiza's performance! I'm happy to say, auggie was & is the true emotional core and drive of the entire series. If they ever make a 2nd season, i pray/hope that they bring back eiza and her character auggie! If they dont, i'll never watch it all. Cause it wouldn't be 3 body problem without eiza or auggie!.",IMDB,eiza deserves awards!,8.0
"Watched this series as the synopsis sounded good, cast is good, reviews looked good, yet I'm left wondering if it was really good or really poor.It starts with a few flashbacks trying to build the story, then moves onto modern day scientists, then to people killing themselves with no explanation whatsoever, then to a dream like reality game headset, then to an alien race that wants to kill humans but not for another 400 years to then an all out war against an enemy that's not even on earth........that breakdown as random and weird as it sounds is exactly what it's like to watch. It leaves you frustrated yet wanting to watch more.I will probably watch the 2nd series should there be one only to try tie up all the loose ends they have left.",IMDB,Good or rubbish....still pondering.,6.0
"Had huge expectations from David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Thoroughly disappointed.I work in a start-up where we work with resource crunch, no money, no facilities, literally nothing and we still make decent products, provide good customer service, take feedback and incorporate it and do a good job. What I fail to understand is, how such big companies & production houses with so much money and resources fail to produce something decent.The series with the Chinese elements were really good including the actors. The rest is all crap. Couldn't tolerate other main actors and their acting. There are so many flaws like bad story telling, no depth in the story or characters, bad dialogues, no sci-fi but magic, bad casting, bad acting and not a single moment of thrill except the first scene in China. The list goes on. Instead of wasting time on watching the series, I would have been better-off reading the novel!",IMDB,Boring to the core,1.0
"In fact i didn't expect it to be any good at first place. The source material is too weak in characters. But 2DB made it by the last three episodes. Characters are more soft and more dimensional in this adaptation compared to the novel. Wade is fantastic, i want to watch more about him.The flaws do exist. In the first several episodes,they ignored too many details in the game, the judgment day action and ye's past experience. This made the show has a terrible pace problem. In the other side, the FX seems mediocre. In past few days news says Netflix invested A LOT in this show, but the production quality makes it not so convincing...
whatever I give it 10, not because the show is perfect, but I don't want it to be canceled by Netflix.Expecting the next season!",IMDB,Quite GOOD!,10.0
"Im waiting for what comes next, season 2 cant come soon enough. If you enjoy mystery, drama and character based shows then you will enjoy this. If you cannot stand sci-fi, though this barely qualifies as its more about the feeling of ""what would you do if this happened to you"", then maybe pass - but I would still encourage you to try.The episodes are shot very well and the use of ARRI's ALFA anamorphics give the show a beautiful look with perfect focus and bokeh. Camera operators are fantastic too. The casting director did a great job (rare for netflix), it's great for a show that has ""smaller"" actors who we've seen before but might not know their name, though most will know the names of quite of a few stars (despite them not being the leads). The ensemble is very believable and very talented.I highly recommend watching the first 2 episodes to get a feel for the series. Its addicting. Also, dave and dan delegating the writing (what they do best) works out here. I assume they are using the same approach that they did for S1-4 of GoT.VFX is excellent, the period sections are excellent; fluid. I cant say anything bad. Could it be better? Everything always can be - but it is very good.",IMDB,"Never read the books, but this is a good show",8.0
"It is very well structured and has very good photography, I have not read the book on which it is based but I will definitely do so when I finish watching the series, I am missing a few chapters but it is a 10!The casting is very well chosen, each one brings a unique nuance to their character, in my opinion this series will give a lot to talk about and I profile it with great acceptance from the public.It is one of the series that will quickly create followers and for which I trust we will have many more seasons like at the time when they released the first season of Strangers Things or The Witcher, Obviously I'm not referring to the next season of The Witcher without Henry Cavil, which they predict will be a disaster.",IMDB,Immersive and challenging,10.0
"You have to remember to keep an open mind with this show.It is hard science fiction and it is amazing from beginning to end.There are a couple of changes from the actual book that work very well including creating the Oxford 5 to take the place of the one main character in the books.The book was a Chinese book that takes place between the Chinese revolution and current modern day China, so they had to change it a little because there's a lot that Western countries may not understand. But the creators didn't pull punches with the opening scene and showing how brutal the revolution was to the people of China.However, the creation of the Oxford 5 just made it that much better and I think we'll serve the western audiences very well as the protagonists.I had a chance to see this last night at the Netflix premiere and it is great from finish to end.I watched as a teenager finally clicked in on one of the big secrets that was actually right in front of their face and hearing him and the rest of the audience gasp. It was so wild.It was a hidden secret in plain daylight.F you're looking for a quick payoff that's not this show, go watch something else.This is good. Hard science fiction with a lot of real science attached to it. So good!.",IMDB,Hard science fiction and it's good!,10.0
"The Netflix series 3 BODY PROBLEM is in my opinion the most significant Science Fiction work to come life on screen since Arthur C. Clarke's 2001 A Space Odyssey. Behind the cinematic production we find the team that created GAME OF THRONES. The series may seem confusing at first but hang in there, once the core precepts become clear to you the revelation of the fresh thinking going on here will make you feel like a pioneer, as great science fiction should. If you miss watching this you are likely to miss a critically important next step in the development of human consciousness.

"This is quite simply the worst Sci-Fi adaptation or standalone TV show created in the last ten years. How it has got so many reviews can only be attributed to shill reviewers who have never seen it or have been paid to give a positive rating.It began with a thin plot around alien tech but slowly degenerated to nothing more than a clumsy cliff note analysis of humanity and its effect on mother earthWe are patronised with the sermon humanity doesn't deserve to live even if the aliens come in peace. We are beyond hope, and if the lead actors were the best we had to offer in defence of an invasion, I would wholeheartedly agree.",IMDB,If You Want Proof Studios Employ Shill Reviewers This is It,1.0
"Tense, thrilling, emotional and cerebral. Great character development. Easily the best show Ive seen in a while.Alexander Woo, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have been uber-successful in creating a visual and dramatic masterpiece by adapting a well-recognized excellent science fiction novel. You feel the visceral, ethical and intellectual struggle with the decisions and challenges these characters all have to make. The series of tragedies that leads Ye Wenjie to sell-out humanity is in particular numbingly sad-- because the viewer is made to empathize with her.""3 Body Problem"" just rises above the useless rot of bad shows that have a lazy audience appeal (""The Gentleman"" or anything with a ""Star Wars"" insignia on it) .",IMDB,A MUST WATCH,10.0
"This adaptation is not 1:1 with the books, and simplifies the more technical/scientific concepts that make the source material so special. However, it still manages to hit all the same narrative beats, and the expanded cast of characters help make the story more approachable for a wider audience. It's a pretty impressive compromise that mostly works. If you are into stories about alien contact and don't care about the deviations from the books, If you are a sci-fi fan you'll love it. Very thought provoking and easier to understand compare to the Chinese version. This is honestly a great watch.",IMDB,Mind Blowing And Amazing!!,10.0
My biggest criticism comes from it being rushed and you don't get the same feeling of revelation as you get from reading the books. A lot of exposition happens to explain things to the audience faster which can be a turn off for some people. Apart from that I love a lot of the changes and by no means should the show be adapted 1:1 to the books. The books had many flaws as well but it was the big ideas in them that make them great and timeless. I feel that the first season of the show captures those ideas perfectly and I wager that the following seasons will stay completely true to the core ideas of the books.,IMDB,"As a book fan, I love this.",10.0
"I just finished watching 3 body problem on Netflix. I usually don't rate tv shows after only watching the first season but this must be the best tv show Netflix has created over the last few years. I loved it so much. It kept me at the urge of my seat. I'm not even sure where to start. It just works. The storyline, the acting, the pace, the setting, everything is just perfect. Humanity is so fragile and resilient. This is not a mindless alien invasion plot. It makes me think about how humans will behave in such an event. They talk about the science and simplify certain things that'll be so complicated to explain. The friendship and the bond between the lead characters is so heartwarming. I really hope Netflix doesn't ruin the show and I hope they release the next season very soon. For those giving it a low rating because of the book adaptation and so on, just grow up. Not everything needs to be the same at all times. This is a beautiful and incredible story. I can't wait for more of this. Solid 10/10. Absolute.",IMDB,Deeply perfect,10.0
"The original series (in Chinese) have always been criticized for its character building but it's exceptional in terms of setting up such a fascinating concept about universe and captivating story plot. At least in the first season, this show corrected the shortcoming of the book and made the characters way more relatable and genuine, Meanwhile appealed to a wider audience while kept its essence. Great job. The story is way bigger than earth, human and our universe. And I agree with most reviews, the visual shows the budget. Can't wait for the second season. I hope Netflix continues this series.",IMDB,The adaptation made it better,9.0
"I have read Cixin Liu's trilogy ""The Remembrance of Earth's"" past twice in the past half decade. I greatly anticipated this show coming out also with some trepidation. The concepts are somewhat complex and the storyline spans centuries. I am happily surprised with how well the show sticks to the storyline and realizes my imagination on screen. The dehydration and dehydration of people is very well designed. Also how they explained Ye's discovery of using the sun as an antennae to amplify radio waves is incredibly similar to how I visualized it from the book's depiction. I was very pleased to read that the character changes the producers chose to make were first approved by the author. Fingers crossed for a second and third season to fully complete this epic saga and one of my favorite science fiction series of all time!",IMDB,My Mind blowing at how this is was just perfect !,10.0

Well I'm not one of those and let me tell you, this series is a very solid 8/10. The story while being paced a bit slower than what I would have liked, at least in the beginning, was still interesting and got me hooked within the first minute without knowing what I was getting into. The acting was mostly well done. Been a while since NF produced something as good as this, and also quite unique. Giving this a 10 to offset the rating since it's way better than most other series rated 8 or even higher.",IMDB,Don't get the low rank,10.0
"Pleasantly surprised to find Netflix made this science fiction into its series. I wasted no time and finished its first season, 8 episodes overnight.The base of the original story lines of the book series remains intact but the key background location of where it's happening has changed from Beijing to London, and subsequently the characters as well, from mostly Chinese to a mix of different races living in UK. Understandable changes when considering its global target audience, but those changes confused me a lot at the beginning.Whether you read the book or not, I would assume that you'll find it pretty entertaining overall. And if you find it difficult or too slow in the beginning, it gets better and clearer once you patiently bear through the first 3~4 episodes. Lastly, I believe Netflix should have made and released maybe about 4 episodes more for its initial season that would've covered the diabolical first battle.",IMDB,A fairly decent show but demands a good deal of patience from the viewers.,8.0

Dont expect a carbon copy of the book but in spirit I think they have spot on. I think everyone gives an excellent performance all around Go watch it and don't listen to these haters.

"The Three-Body Problem"" series is a bold and ambitious journey into one of science fiction's most profound narratives. As a fan of Liu Cixin's original trilogy, I approached this adaptation with a mix of excitement and trepidation. However, what I found was a series that respects the soul of the source material whilst making necessary adjustments for a global audience.Critics have been quick to point out deviations from the book, arguing that the series sacrifices scientific detail and character depth for broader appeal. Yet, this view overlooks the essence of adaptation - the art of translating complex ideas into a different medium. I think this was necessary for Netflix to do in order to appeal to a broader audience and hopefully secure an order for season two.To those hesitant to give this adaptation a chance, I urge you to approach it with an open mind. This series pays homage to the original while carving its own path in new and interesting ways. It was definitely one of the most unique watches I've had in a long time.",IMDB,A Visionary Adaptation That Deserves Your Open Mind,10.0

They could have fit it into 5 episodes really as I felt myself losing interest during the last 3 episodes.In the end it just turns into your typical, boring, 'safe the world' series where everything is hinging on a small team of 'heroes'.I would rate the first 5 episodes as 8/10 and the last 3 episodes as 3/10. I wouldn't bother watching it if I knew how it was going to turn out. Save your time.",IMDB,Don't Waste Your Time,5.0
I am a big fan of the book and has watched the tencent series as well. I think it is a great adaptation suited for a wider audience who is usually not very much into the hard sci-fi. The characters are easier to follow than in the books. The events in the books are presented with great visual effects. The acting is good and I am impressed how the setting in 1960 China is very authentic The pacing is good that things keep moving and then there is a bit of flash back. I hope the show will keep running for season 2 and 3.Netflix definitely has a lot more budget than tencent to work on the visuals of the VR game. I really like how that part was presented too.,IMDB,Great adaptation,10.0
"Very interesting plot and ideas, while I would say the character development isn't so good that it feels personal, it is more like the thriller pace and character development. It is full of tension and rarely starts getting boring or slow paced. I did not read the book myself but I heard that it is different to the book but apparently changes parts of the story, but in a way that makes it easier to understand and to follow. Compared to the Chinese TV series, it is more fast paced. The directors obviously read the book and put thought into it to make sure the story makes sense, and becomes a fitting adaptation of the book.",IMDB,"Summed up: Tension, wild and interesting ideas",9.0
"Been looking forward to this show since first hearing of it, and with a title like The 3 Body Problem - relating to cosmology - the hook was in. So far I'm not disappointed, and thankfully no real attempt at shoehorned or overt DEI which is an instant joy killer for me. I'd say that if you're not the patient sort or not interested in science then this first episode could be a bit of a chore, however I loved everything about episode 1 and seeing some of the cast from GoT. On reflection, episode 1 was reminiscent of Sense8 - another incredible show - which also had a slow yet complicated opener.

"As I start the second half of this opening season I am already wanting a second season airing date and I would like it soon @netflix.This show is off the scale and if you like Sci-Fi, drama and mystery then this show is there for you to watch.In an uncertain world we have a certain kind of certainty in that we have four basic seasons each year. But in a galaxy far far away, 400 years at ludicrous speed, things are a little different. They have the 3 Body Problem. To fix their issue they have a solution. Earth.If you liked and were shocked that The Peripheral was cancelled after one season then you'll like this show. It brings that show back closer to our reality things we can see, feel but more importantly, we understand.So if you like your Sci Fi then ignore the reviews from the Daily Mail and co for they know not what they are talking about even when it's cut and pasted from a real story.This show is top shelf and with a script, cast and direction all spot on I.

Couldn't get further than one episode - the opening sequence in China was pretty good and drew me in but then we are introduced to our main characters- some of the cleverest scientists in the western world at the top of their profession and unfortunately they are just badly cast and have dialogue akin to university first years - seriously it's terrible dialogue and doesn't in any way make the characters believable.Diversity in your casting is great but the dialogue and characterisation in this production works against the diversity and makes no one seem like a real person at the top of the scientific community. Can't tell whether it's bad acting or bad direction maybe both but it's all just awful.,IMDB,Casting and dialogue are awful.,2.0
I never read the book so I didn't have any expectations. The begining was a little hard to get into but it kept my attention and grew to the point where I ended up watching the whole season in two days. It has enough real science to keep it real enough. There were a few spots that were really reaching the limits of believability though. I hope they have a second season. If you watch beyond the 3rd episode it starts to pull things together so keep watching. The characters are great and really keep you wanting more. It's not so out the realm of thinking something like this couldn't actually happen but it does stretch those limits a few times.,IMDB,I think it started a bit slow but it kept me going until I ended up binging the wholw season in 2 days.,9.0

There are moments of shock and horror, sweetness and humor, realism and complete fantastical ... events. Its fabulous. Its everything I want in a Sci-Fi story and I hope they continue this for many many years. I also am a huge fan of the books, I had zero problem with changes for the screen, they could not possibly try to recreate the book and so they didn't.

"Yup. You read the title right. The fact that this show is so detached to 3BP is the exact reason why it's a show worth watching.I really do not understand why Three Body Problem was such a great book. It suffered from severe pacing issues and devoted far too much time to irrelevant details. It also suffered from severe plot holes and setting issues, such as how one of the characters broadcasted a radio signal in a way so simple that others should have thought of it beforehand. In addition, the book brought up VR but never explained its significance to the common people (Is RP1 happening worldwide? Who knows?). The book does this with millions of other concepts and fails to elaborate on any of them. There was just too many ideas - too much fat.Why did I rant so much about the book? Because surprisingly, a Netflix adaptation with the traditional Netflix elements solved every one of the issues above. It really tightened the pacing and grappled with the core issues of the book only - nothing else. It preserved what was important and discarded what wasn't. Sometimes, I feel like the netflix/hollywood hate can get over the top, blinding people of truly enjoyable shows.In conclusion, this show improves everything there was on the book and I would recommend this over the trilogy any day. Please ignore the other haters, they're just blinded by the mindless mob hate I mentioned previously. Just go watch it and let it wow you.P. S. For an actual good Sci-fi read I would suggest the Ender Quartet (especially the first two books) as well as Dune.",IMDB,Removed completely from its source - and that's a good thing,9.0

There is enough mystery and excitement to keep people following the show. The visuals of the VR game is amazing. Engrossing television show with an interesting twist on the usual 1st contact scifi story, big action sequences, and great performances by most of the actors.

"China is going through cultural revolution 2.0,
so here are some thoughts of the new generation of red guards:1. In Episode One, Ye Zhetai was beaten to death by the red guards at the criticism rally. This was to provide foreign people, medias, governments outside China with materials to criticize China.2. China has developed its own version of 3 Body Problem series with a lot less money. There are 2 scenes that can't speak for the high investment of the Netflix version because in these two scenes Netflix version does not demonstrate a complete superiority over the Chinese version. (One scene is where nanofiber wires cut through the ship and the other is where stars blinking on and off in unison.) Therefore it can be concluded that the Netflix high investment was misappropriated and the world outside China does not do better than China in the business of anti-corruption.This is why there's a large percentage of audience (7%) rated 1 out of 10 up to the time when I finished this article.

"Brought to you by the very same people who couldn't end GoT properly, comes another strange adaptation of cult-classic books.For the record, no, Netflix did NOT in fact, 'do a 180' by showing the Cultural Revolution (which killed not one lone university professor, but instead saw 1.5 million people beaten to death or tortured to death in camps just because they were deemed academic bourgeois). The books in the first page are far more graphic and call a spade a spade: men and women have their head blown off by teenage bullies because ""Marxism"". But of course Netflix would never use the ""M"" word.Anyways after that little incursion in China, Netflix of course spends the other 9 episodes re-gendering every character (all strong characters are female, males are litteral doormats, one of them having qualms about complaining about getting friendzoned as he .. dies of cancer). In the book, everyone is Chinese, here, evidently, that cannot be - so you have one Indian, one Black (who smokes weed and drops acide while working a particle accelerator), one White (who is reckless loser , fat and stupid, and gets offed in episode 3 of course).And evidently, there's political commentary everywhere, which flies in the face of what the book was about. Heck, even ""Logic"" (the name of the ONE character in the books that considers betraying his people), has been transformed into an always-oppressed Latina woman who hapens to be a model and hates capitalism. She calls people 'fascists' when they take strong action and complains a lot about 'the men, the men'. .

It's refreshing to discover something Chinese with such a gripping and fast-paced plot, especially since they're often slow and clichéd, like a B movie. This feels truly original. I haven't found any parts of the show boring; it's one mystery after another, keeping you hooked. While it might not reach the same heights as 'Game of Thrones' or 'Westworld,' it's definitely worth watching. The first two episodes vividly depict the horrors of Chinese history and the fervor of Maoist nationalism. With the current situation in Hong Kong, all the hostilities directed towards the West or Japan and a director from the region, this TV show could serve as a cautionary tale against history repeating itself in China, adding an extra layer of dread alongside the alien elements.",IMDB,"Finally, a captivating science fiction piece from China",9.0
"The first episodes are somewhat surrealistic, but the excitement picks up considerably towards the end. This is well-crafted and entertaining.

However, some of the characters seem a bit like superheroes or cartoon characters, which detracts a bit, while others are much more believable. A bit of deduction for casting and character development regarding these cartoonish figures. You have to accept significant logical plot holes. We're talking about a highly intelligent race that sees us as primitive liars and insects, yet they bother to warn us and communicate with us, despite being able to study everything without revealing themselves.

The events are displayed with proper emotion and impact, and some of the scenes are likely going to become cinematographic icons in the upcoming years.The ideas are really original and the world building is top notch.The acting was pretty good with perhaps the exception of two characters, which felt a little bland in a couple of scenes.The scenes that happened in the past felt very real and acting was really top notch there.I can't not wait for season two to see how the end of the story unfolds!",IMDB,Probably the most exciting sci-fi story of recent years,9.0
"Best of the TV services of Netflix so far!I have read the original novel years ago and it was mind blowing! This Netflix series won't be able to create the immersive vibe the book provided.This Netflix version mostly focused on the Oxford 5 which are created by the script writers that not in the original book, which is fine. But the problem is the script writers lack of talent to create the tense that the whole human species were under threat and the urge to find a solution to save us from extermination.8 episodes are too short. Can't wait for the 2 season! Hope the 2 season can have more from the original book.",IMDB,Best of the TV services of Netflix so far!,10.0
"I want to first state that I have not read the books, but have heard great things about them from others who have. Therefore, I was pretty excited to start this series. I am not sure how much was adapted from the book or how true the series is to the original. But I sincerely hope the books are a lot better than this.To start, this show is unpredictable, but not in the good way. More in like a ""there's no way this really stupid or random thing is going to happen, that would make no sense at all"" - but then it does happen, way. I will not spoil anything, but the ship scene comes to mind. This was an incredibly dumb and horrific event that had absolutely no reason to it. There are about 6000 other ways that the ship scenario could have been handled better and more realistically. Like I truly cannot put into to words how little sense went into that decision making. There are also various other scenes where characters make choices that are so random or outside of their ideals. This makes it hard to care about any of the characters, because none of them actually have true values or conflicts. There is only one character worth rooting for, but they are the one with the shortest amount of screen time.That's another issue I had, the characters and acting are just so bad. They add a bunch of forced scenes where the characters sit and have ""deep"" talks with each other, but it ends up being so boring and forced. In reality we learn so little about each of the main characters. The most I can say about them is: there's one who knows absolutely everything about physics, there's one who is pessimistic and just wants the world to die off, the rich finance one, and there's the Mexican one (I say that because that is literally the only information the show constantly throws at us about her).Overall the show follows no logic, is extremely underwhelming, and very rushed.",IMDB,Unpredictable in the worst way.,2.0
"At first I was scared, but now that I saw all the episodes, I can safely say that Three Body Problem by Netflix is a pretty good show. Of course it's not as good and subtle as the books, but yeah of course, it's an adaptation, things need to be changed for to work as a TV show.A lot of people think that the Tencent show is far more better but I strongly disagree. I watched all the 30 episodes of it and it was horribly passed, I had the force myself to finish it. This new Netflix show is better in a lot of ways and he's absolutely a must-watch for the fans and non fans of Three Body Problem. I even hope they'll do a season 2 !",IMDB,"As a fan of the books, it's a really good show",9.0
"This show is great sci-fi, good pace, and they did a good job of summarizing the very detailed character-development in the first book. The Chinese adaptation was too long with over-dramatic characters for the global audience to connect with but this one is good and I'm already hopeful for the second season. The production is of high quality and it's a good team, the producers also have shown before that they are great at adapting great source materials and books (when they exist!). Unfortunately a lot of people are just hating this show because of being still mad at the producers or some people expected this to be super-faithful to the books (which would've resulted in 30 hours of boring TV for just the first book like the Tencent version)...",IMDB,Yesss.

"It's just sad to witness low star ratings ""driven by unfinished agendas from angry fans of another TV series"" tarnishing the good reputation of this ""3-Body Problem"" TV series, especially when those viewers haven't even watched the show. Baseless negativity stemming from grievances towards the show-runners from a previous series is simply unjustifiable.Let's set the record straight: this TV series is monumental and impressive from every angle. And just to be clear ""Adapting"" a novel to the screen entails capturing its essence of the novel rather than replicating every detail. Much like ""Game of Thrones,"" ""The 3-Body Problem"" starts off slowly and gradually, but patience is rewarded. By episode three, you'll be completely hooked.Time will reveal the true worth of this series, and genuine positive ratings will eventually overshadow the unfair, blind judgments driven by grudges from disgruntled ""Game of Thrones"" fans. ""The 3-Body Problem"" deserves to be judged on its own merits.Let's honor the creativity and dedication behind this remarkable adaptation, rather than allowing unfounded biases to overshadow its brilliance.

It really is quite a seamless story dripping in complexity. The cinematography is amazing, and the storytelling superb.It just consumes your mind, I mean it's engaging.

"I have not read the novel and I dived in the show with no preconceptions. Well, I was disappointed quite rapidly as the some of the elements of the story killed the interest I had for the show.So the Chinese had their own SETI project, that's fine. Then we see that Ye Wenjie makes contact with an alien being. I will pass on the fact that being able to decode a alien signal and translate it into a human language is done in a very short time (hours? Mins?). That was my first hic.Vera Ye's death is mysterious and her mother tells Jin that Vera did a very unusual thing before her death which was playing a VR game using a wireless helmet. Jin and Jack supposedly highly educated and smart people act, surprisingly, in the dumbest possible way. Instead trying to find out the origins of the helmet and its technology they are oblivious to all the warning they use it! Auggie tells them ""We don't have this technology"", ""that thing is hacking into your brain"" and THEY KEEP PLAYING WITH DAMN HELMET? Seriously! Now the sequence where Auggie uses the helmet for the first time in Episode 3 is supposed to convince us that the characters act in a sane and rational way. Well they do, except Jin and Jack but let's say the helmet may have turned them into addicts of the game. The others however, just let it go and leave the helmet with Jin and jack instead to studying as it seems to be one of the key elements of the puzzle.All those scientist mysteriouly dying or murdered aroung the world and only one guy is investigating the case? When you think that somebody is making the sky blink using morse code you put all the ressources you have on it!The show clumsily tries to get our attention on the game and its mysteries then on the Aliens. But It's hard to go past the ridiculous parts of the plot.To finish the idea of making the sky blink (they say universe in the show which is laughable). Does not make any sense for so many reasons that it would be too long to explain here. Let's just say that the stars we see are just a tiny portion of what our Galaxy. At least we know that the sky did not actually blink but they just point it out and do absolutely nothing about it.",IMDB,"They actually think we, the viewers are gullible imbeciles.",1.0
"I understand if you don't like the variation from the source material, but I judge shows purely on how they exist as a show. As a TV show, 3 Body Problem is pretty good. I don't know that it will rise to the heights of Game Of Thrones, but Dan, Dave and Alexander managed to take complicated source material and adapt it into a pretty accessible show that's meant to appeal to everyone. Do they piss off alot of hardcore fanboys in process? Yes. But that may be a risk worth taking. Terrific stuff.

"As a fan from China, I have read the original work and watched the Chinese version of the TV series. But I have to admit that Netflix did a better job this time, deeply restoring China's crazy history and the dark side of human nature. The plot is more reasonable and smooth after the adaptation, and the special effects are amazing. The performances of the characters are very wonderful, and you can really feel the heavy sense of fate just by looking at their expressions.

I'm giving 8/10 bcs i felt like we should have seen even a little bit of the aliens or whatever they were. To be more exciting or clips of what the future holds. However this is just how i would have preffered. This series is good quality and you can see that it's done by a big budget.

While they clearly had to speed things up and short-change some concepts, all the big ones were there, and I thought they did an admirable job of showing us things like the military computer, the creation of a sophon, the Judgement Day scene, etc. Most of which were incredibly important to the plot. I think the changes they made did good work in moving the plot along to keep it all well paced for TV.

"3 Body Problem"" presents a challenging yet captivating journey into the depths of science fiction. While the opening episode may feel concept-heavy, the subsequent episodes unfold into a mind-blowing narrative that spans multiple decades and delves into the complexities of time and space. As the first season progresses, it becomes evident that these initial episodes serve as a solid foundation for a much larger and intricately woven story. Ambitious in scope, the series impresses with its rich array of concepts and intricate plotlines, making it an intellectually stimulating experience. Nevertheless, ""3 Body Problem"" stands out as one of the best sci-fi TV shows to date, offering viewers an immersive experience that transcends the boundaries of time and space.

"As an avid reader of hard sci-fi, this series is the most convincing grand-scale adaptation I have ever seen on a screen.The quality of execution, and the level of crowd-pleasing ""dumbing down"" for this series, is spot-on - especially for such heady hard sci-fi source material. As a stand-alone show in its first season with no context from the books, its easy to mistake masterful unfulfilled foreshadowing for meandering unevenness. In particular, the roles that deception and uncertainty play in the long arc of the book trilogy - only the seeds of which are planted in this season. The show creators have proven themselves quite capable to adapt subtle source material with moral ambiguity and deception as main thematic elements (Game of Thrones), so I am extremely excited to see how they handle the fruition of those seeds in later seasons. Scenes which seem trivial and useless now may turn out to be tremendously important later. So many ""watch S1 again after finishing S2"" easter eggs!While the story departs from the source books substantially in characters and setting, it is remarkably faithful to the key plot points and epic scale. I have a few qualms about some characters (writing for Saul could be better, and really needs to be in S2, same for Auggie), yet nothing the viewer can't overlook given very strong performances from most of the cast. Knowing where the books go, for a no-context first-time viewer Season 1 is truly the most earnest of beginnings, and a fantastic setup for the full-bore happenings in the second and third books.Further avoiding the GoT trap of feeling rushed at the end, all the source books are already written! Further, the series ending in the 3rd book is particularly virtuosic on author Cixin Liu's part, which showrunners apparently want to depict more than anything else. If they can pull off the build up to that amazingly poignant ending, this show will be remembered as one of the all-time greats among ""hard sci-fi with crowd appeal"".",IMDB,Hard Sci-Fi for a general audience - done right!,9.0
"I just finished the first two episodes of Netflix's adaptation of ""The Three-Body Problem"", which gracefully traverses the complex terrain of Liu Cixin's novel, offering viewers an immersive experience that delves deep into the intricacies of science fiction while artfully intertwining historical and cultural elements. The Netflix adaptation stays almost true to the essence of the original novel. As a fan of Liu Cixin's work, I appreciate the meticulous attention to the faithfulness of the core themes and plotlines. BTW, in my view, the Netflix adaptation shines in its casting choices, which inject a refreshing international flair into the narrative. Diverse actors bring depth and authenticity to their roles, enriching the story with a vibrant tapestry of cultures and perspectives.One of the most memorable moments of the first two episodes is the unflinching portrayal of historical events, particularly the Cultural Revolution in China at the beginning of the first episode. The director deftly captures the brutality and upheaval of one of the signature scenes of the Cultural Revolution in China (i.e., the Struggle Session or the Denunciation). I applaud the director's efforts. PS, I doubt whether the Chinese government will greenlight this show in mainland China because of this opening scene.Can't wait to finish the remaining 6 episodes.",IMDB,"""The Three-Body Problem"": Netflix's Adaptation",10.0
"3 Body Problem can be about anything: alien invasions, our self-destructive nature, climate change, science, religion, and how people always find a way. It poses ethical dilemmas and humanizes characters. I guess it is for each of us to see what we want most. Thankfully, there are options.Compared to the books, the series seems more fast-paced and, understandably, skips some insights and explanations. On the other hand, so far, it excels in the one area Liu Cixin was not great at: developing characters. Sure, some critics may argue that it's not following the book 100%, but it brilliantly captures the main points of it, while making it more interesting for broad audiences. It's been a while since we last had a mainstream Sci-Fi visual that includes some actual science while also having great characters.This season is an adaptation of the first book from a trilogy.

"Well I've binged the first four episodes,and requiring sleep,so finish tomorrow, so far...The cast a few members from GOT,plus next generation actors,same script writers,so I reckon curiosity dragged viewers in.May investigate the books,one of the actors who is prominent so far was in another hard science sci-fi movie UFO Alex Sharp..... very thoughtful clever movie,low budget but gripping.Benedict Wong playing a mid character spook with his homegrown Lancashire drawl Liam Cunningham usual salty language,lot of Anglo-Saxon expletives from most of the characters,so reminiscent of GOT flavour.I do like the 1960's historical references to the cultural revolution in China,and the effect of martial law by the military upon the general population.However whoever's in power in history,profit is always on the agenda,all the human aspects of plagiarism,deceit, and misuse of power.An exercise in futuristic virtual game play is now in use but really an alien recruitment ploy to get earthling followers and acolytes.Episode 5 is the big reveal,hard science required to solve the riddles The Alien visitors somehow manipulate the internet,and reveal their existence to the world at large, using communication hi tech software, light years ahead of Earth There is great spectacular cgi in this episode,gruesome,and cutting edge.... They will arrive in 400 years........ News clips with our present world leaders shown ...a cheap trick.World leaders then decide to fund the science for new technology.And invest in future science and engineering But as usual the problem will be someone else's future to solve The general population are frightened into conformity The big finale ,the engineering and science fall over, borrowed heavily from a 1960's actual science project, lookup ""Project Orion"" ,using nuclear blast propulsion in outer space Fast space travel not quite there yetI suppose it's popular enough for a second season...?..",IMDB,2nd review from mobile account pappywatts,9.0

"The premise is fascinating: strange scientific phenomena mark an upcoming invasion of (apparently) malign aliens, albeit not before some 400 years, so the world has to figure out a defense strategy for future generations. The flashbacks to communist China in the first episodes are hair-raisingly intense, and all the weird and creepy happenings in the present create an eerie atmosphere, heavy with looming doom. I loved the scenes with the VR headgears, they are excellently done, with beautiful visuals and impressive CGI. Then episode 5 (""Judgement Day"") gave us a truly sensational climax with the attack on the cargo ship where the sect-like followers of the aliens have gathered, I was completely blown away by the absolutely stunning VFX!Unfortunately after that, both urgency and pace collapsed, personal and relational issues dominated episodes 6 and 7 and made these way too talkative and sentimental, it almost caused me to quit. Luckily the last episode picked it up again, and at least created a solid, intriguing bridge to a second season.The acting is overall fine, with special mention of Liam Cunningham as the relentlessly authoritative Wade. Alex Sharp as Will is great, but his role was a bit too tearjerking for my taste.

Having suffered through Apple TV's interpretation of ""Foundation"", I did not have high hopes for the adaption of The Three Body Problem.But actually, it is fantastic and fun. Reducing a 1000+ page book down to eight episodes was always going to leave some things out, but the writers have included all the best parts, and it's consistent with the ideas and story from the book.Liberties have been taken with the internationalisation of the characters and set, but it doesn't detract from the story in any way. The Chinese adaptation of the book hardly touched on Mao's 1960s terror (for obvious reasons) so if anything, the Netflix adaptation is more true to the original source.It is intelligent TV, fun to watch and I am already looking forward to seasons 2 and 3.

"In China, the most repulsive point of the drama is that it reveals the wounds of the Cultural Revolution. Additionally, the show has replaced the original Chinese characters with characters of different skin colors, making Chinese people feel overlooked.Although many critics claim to be fans of the original work, most of them position themselves as patriots and criticize the TV series from a nationalist perspective, which I find sad.Unexpectedly, this series became a victim of Chinese nationalism after Messi. The depiction of the Cultural Revolution at the beginning of the series is an accurate portrayal of today's Chinese society, with a malicious government, an ignorant populace, and victims with no recourse.Perhaps it's not a complete adaptation of the original, lacking many elements from the original work, but it is still a good series.",IMDB,A high rating from China,10.0

"So we have a Mexican woman who can build strings so thin yet so strong that they cut open an entire steel-hulled modern ship by kinetic energy alone, some random black dude who figured out the secret to save the world (eventually, but not forever, we will see how they write it), a Chinese refugee who achieved 1% of light speed with human spacecraft in our lifetime.The two white dudes are of course soft, sickly and focused on material indulgence and personal feelings rather than any of the above, and both died early in the show, no surprise there. To quote that black dude in the movie Evolution (2001): ""The black dude dies first!"", now it's just the situation reversed.Well one of them might not truly be dead, he would come back and (try to) save the world too, if the show stays (at least somewhat) loyal to the book.But none of them are important, the real question: Why is there no Native American among the Oxford 5, this supposedly very evenly spaced and therefore very P.

And it has me wondering how wonderfully highly amazing it ought to be watching the next six or two or ten seasons of that 3 body problem.Some scenes, so extreme, are forever etched into my memory, as for some scenes of got. Things making me thinking like: ""they can't go there, wait, they are, w-t-f they are - I wonder ... oh, omg, they did, and I can't be unseeing that"".

Mbe the directors salaries as there is very little expensive stuff to see.It's poor, rather boring and as already said the TERRIBLE acting just ruins it.I was SO excited to see this but it was horribly disappointing for me, it's doesn't come even close to doing the story justice.I cannot recommend watching this - READ THE BOOKS + Avoid this crappy show.",IMDB,VERY dissatisfying Poor Acting Ruined the show for Me,3.0

I really do not understand why this does not have at least a score of 8, it has great acting and from what I have read, the adaptation is very decent (which is something I do not really care that much about, but just in case you were wondering).I hope they do a second season, I have not read the books but the premise and story is really interesting, I cannot wait to see what will happen next.

Hopefully a second season is on it's way... I don't know how this first one will end, hopefully not in a way that makes a second season pointless...

The sub plots are well laid out and unlike other shows where sometimes you dont know what's going on, they did a good job here. Taken the time to build characters - though a couple of actor selections could have been better. My only complaint is that it ended in such an unresolved place. I haven't read the book. Is there more to this story? Will there be another season? I hope so. I felt like they were only just getting started when the finale wrapped up.

"""3 Body Problem"" on Netflix, from the creators of ""Game of Thrones,"" boasts a captivating premise and stunning visuals, drawing audiences into a richly imagined sci-fi universe. However, akin to the criticisms of its predecessor, the series suffers from pacing issues and questionable character decisions. While the intricate plot keeps viewers engaged, some character arcs feel rushed or underdeveloped, leaving audiences longing for more depth. Yet, the breathtaking special effects and thought-provoking themes ensure a thrilling ride, even amidst its flaws. With a blend of mystery, suspense, and a touch of existential dread, ""3 Body Problem"" remains a must-watch for sci-fi enthusiasts, despite its occasional missteps.",IMDB,"Amazing show, but the directing is GoT on repeat.",9.0
"The show would probably have a chance if it has taken itself less seriously. You cannot have it both ways, tackling a a subject like this that can be prolonged for many years and seasons, rushing it through the important parts and spending whole episodes on unremarkable cry baby scenes. The main characters are completely insufferable, acting like spoiled teenagers although they are supposedly top notch scientists. It is very difficult to not get frustatrated with them having these behavioural ups and downs while the rest of the cast/world has to put up with them because ... no reason. And that's the biggest problem of the show.

"The first six minutes of episode one looked horrible, and I fast forwarded through them, but as soon as the 2024 story started, I was hooked; and that hasn't let up yet.In the middle of episode 4, I decided to start over from the beginning, to understand better what has happened, and that has alleviated the confusion. It's all making sense. Well, more and more. Several stories are running simultaneously, but I'm sure they will all join up.This show (and presumably the novel) deals with many questions, and allows (forces) us to deal with them too. Among them are ""are we alone in the universe, and if not, have we been contacted?"" and also ""Why does our time seem so chaotic? Have we lost the ability to solve our own problems? Are we doomed? And if so, what can we do about it?""Every time I pause my binging, I have to walk around to come back into this reality. These episodes have been that compelling. And I have the feeling it's going to take me even farther afield. Wow. I'll be updating this review as I watch further episodes. It's rare that I need to write a review this early, but these guys have got me. I guess Game of Thrones wasn't a fluke.Good work, Netflix!",IMDB,looks like it will be excellent,9.0
"I approached this series with some trepidation, having never delved into the original novel. However, through novel walkthrough videos, I gained a grasp of the story's intricacies, which primed me for the viewing experience.One aspect that stood out to me was Netflix's skillful fusion of North American filmography with Eastern storytelling. The seamless blend of Western and Eastern elements added a dynamic flavor to the series, making it a captivating watch from start to finish.While the series has garnered its share of negative reviews, I believe much of the criticism stems from a lack of understanding of Chinese history and culture. It's akin to presenting South Park or The Simpsons to a Chinese audience without the context of Western cultural references. Without a solid grasp of Chinese history, including the Cultural Revolution and the significance of various dynasties and historical figures, viewers may miss the depth and brilliance of the author's narrative.At its core, this is a sci-fi story with layers of cultural and historical significance. To fully appreciate its complexity and depth, viewers would benefit from a deeper understanding of Chinese history and culture.In conclusion, I foresee the series gaining greater appreciation as awareness of Chinese history expands among non-Chinese audiences. It serves as a bridge between cultures, offering a glimpse into a rich tapestry of stories waiting to be explored.Overall, a commendable effort from Netflix, and I eagerly anticipate future seasons that continue to blend the best of both worlds.",IMDB,A Fascinating Blend of Cultures and Genres!,10.0

"So it's some really cool, mind-bending sci-fi for people who enjoy well-thought, complex and horrifying scif-fi. It's well structure, story-wise, and the script is very good for the most part. There's also plenty of locations that naturally look fantastic, and I like a lot of the cast.The downside is, of course - Netflix itself. Somehow no matter the talent, everything Netflix does looks sooo cheap often, and it's really disheartening that some sets, a lot of the CG and often-times the lighting is just cheap looking.Some of the casting is downright horrible, with the wooden Saul, the grumpy charmless Auggie and the dough-eyed Will being outright grating, particularly when sharing a scene.Still, it's heady sci-fi, it's well put together, it gave me that cosmic horror tingle, and I am looking forward to more of it.",IMDB,"Starts Off Well and Gets Better, But Netflixed",8.0

"I felt like I was watching a rerun of the final season of Game of Thrones. Did the series have something to do with the books? Yes, sort of, but everything was extremely rushed, particularly the most important and wonderful parts of the books, the mind-blowing ideas. Instead, Benioff and Weiss added a whole bunch of extraneous characters and storylines, which have nothing to do with the book and which didn't add to the story in any way, but only proved how politically correct they could be. The environmental message was completely lost. The author's fascinating views and ideas of how a human society would be transformed by the knowledge that they were going to be attacked by aliens with vastly superior technology- also lost in favor of producing Disney-like storylines instead. I hated how much everything was dumbed down. All of the Chinese locations were changed to Oxford, England of all places and names were Anglicized. Clearly Americans are too dumb to remember Chinese names. The wonderful physics puzzles which gradually unfold in the books were glossed over with lightning speed in favor of hot chicks with swords. The video game was totally ruined imo. Again, clearly Benioff and Weiss think that Americans are too dumb to understand physics, even when explained by someone as amazing as Cixin Liu. And I'm no physics genius. I was always terrible at physics in school, but the author explains it so well that even I can understand it. Overall, this felt like yet another ho-humm marvel movie. If you really want to know what the book was about, read it. If reading is not your thing, then watch the Chinese series, which is currently airing on prime. It has its flaws: it's too drawn out and has the most god-awful soundtrack, but it's very faithful to the source material and overall an excellent film adaptation with a very genuine feel to it. If you want to see a movie series, in which the source material was completely transformed to make the story more exciting and interesting while preserving the author's original ideas, watch Foundation. I won't be watching any more garbage by Benioff and Weiss.",IMDB,Rerun of the final season of GOT,2.0

As an astrophysicist these ideas and concepts are complex but also very human and this is managed well in the script to appeal to a range of audiences.I cannot wait to see how they go about adapting in future seasons, as what is too come is unbelievable in size and scope, expanding upon thought-provoking themes of humanity and our cosmic existence that lies ahead.",IMDB,An incredible sci-fi adaptation,10.0

"I knew absolutely nothing about this series when I started watching it apart from the fact it was set in China/UK and it had something to do with aliens.Hard to know where to start really - the show begins as a kind of murder mystery with an almost supernatural element to it. It then brings in religious themes followed by horror. It hits home on so many levels - the human relationships within it are powerful and evolved. The science is complex, but pure. The questions it throws up - about the nature of God, life, right and wrong, good/evil.The directors previously brought us Game of Thrones and some of the production qualities are the same. This show really doesn't hold back and there's some moments that will be uncomfortable for the squeamish. Many of the GoT cast are used and without exception they are brilliant in their roles - the entire cast in fact is excellent. I found it odd to learn that it was a US production because it is mainly set in the UK with a largely British cast.The contrast between crazy VR world settings and a local English pub is just one of the quirks that make this show so appealing. So many SF shows are completely detached from the world we live in, we never connect the themes to our current lives. This show won't let you escape that easily - if you don't sleep just a little uneasily wondering ""what if"" after a couple of the episodes then I'll be surprised.I look forward to the second and third series, although I feel that they're unlikely to surpass this masterpiece.",IMDB,Gripping SF mystery covering an enormous number of provocative themes,10.0
"I liked this TV series. It hooks you up and I repeatedly watched 2 times already. I did not like some aspects of it though. First, this is a Sci-fi show, why everybody--supposedly scientists--always keep smoking cigarette, alcohol, weed and other drugs? Also, so much cursing as if they are from the streets! Where is logic? Are they junkies or scientists? Second, Auggie character is annoying. She looks nothing like a scientist! She mostly looks like a spoiled teenage girl. I don't feel anything when she 'tries' to act. No connection at all. Third, 7th episode was boring and empty. Too much focus on Will Downing character was unnecessary, boring conversations and gazing all along. Finally, Saul as a Wallfacer? Come on! He is as boring and useless as Auggie. They should play in movies about spoiled rich brats: reckless, irresponbsible, constantly intoxicated and whining characters. All they care about is gut feeling, hedonism (Saul) and fashion posing (Auggie). Gut feeling is not necessarily logical, nor useful. Also, his act after he was announced as Wallfacer was ridiculous and childish and idiotic. Even after he was shot, he still acts like a child. Really annoying! Sci-fi movies must not adopt 'the chosen one for no reason' or more ridiculously 'it is in your blood' mentality, they should promote the importance of hard work, education, passion and genius instead. Otherwise, remove the ""sci"" part and just keep ""fi"" part!! Don't ruin science fiction!Also, I would love to see how San-ti or their planets look like. At least they could show them shortly.This could be a great TV show, could get 9 or 9.5. Bad characters and too much mystery erased 2 points I guess.",IMDB,Great Sci-fi but...,8.0
"If this show's name is not 3 body problem,I will give it 10/10 for its fancy CG ,music and suspension story ,but it's not!!!!I can't find any respect to the original novel. The death count down was a great setting in the novel.leading the characters to find out what trouble they are in and show how scientists use their wisdom and strength to break mist. But in this show it showed up in a bloody suicide scene? Like it's a Strange horror gimmick. And what is going on with the 🍻 pub scene? A shallow man try to hook up with two girls and they show how intelligent and independent they are by saying their identity are replacement and plot tool the writer creat to fill the plot hole he dig during his adaptation?At the end let's talk about it's political correctness problem.

"This series calls for patience with the gradual presentation as the story unfolds both internationally and intergalactically across generations of time, but once you get ensconced it provides exquisite engagement in a blend of heady science and sci-fi fantasy, even exploring the dynamics of existence itself. The development of the characters and their interactions is what carries the screenplay beyond the special effects extravaganza it also provides. Having an actress of stellar hotness cast in a lead role as an obtusely annoying genius nanoscientist is awkward to a flaw, but the other female lead is pretty easy to look at too and plays a much more likable character. There's no lack of woke and antichrist stuff but it is realistically presented as the way it is and incorporated into the cultural expose' the series succeeds at. Liam Cunningham plays virtually the same character he played in the movie 24 Hours to Live, and he is perfect here as is the eccentrically compelling Benedict Wong. Rating loses 1 star for dragged out emphasis on interpersonal emoting at the expense of the awesome spy thriller sci-fi fantasy action mind control stuff, with Tatiana in tights & that sworded Sophon...

"I do love the show, and want to see the next season.But there is a clear error about the speed of SanTI fleet!I remember that the original work said that the maximum speed of the Trisolaran aka SanTi fleet is 10% of the speed of light, not 1%.You know the fact that spaceships usually spent a certain amount of time to accelerate and decelerate, it cannot always be at the maximum speed, so it takes four hundred years to travel four light years.Reason is living being (our human body) will be crashed if the spaceship accelerating/decelerating too fast to get the high speed. Not like the sophone which is a proton can be easily get the speed of light.Thus, most of the time costs of space fleet are for accelerating and decelerating.I don't know if the Netflix writers didn't understand it themselves, or they were afraid of not explaining it clearly to the audience.In the play, the fleet is slowed down to 1% of the speed of light, which makes it look like a kindergarten arithmetic problem : PThat is 4.0 cy / 0.01 c/y = 400 yBut there are still bugs. Even 1% of the speed of light is still a very high speed.

"I personally think it's good, with a fast-paced rhythm that suits the tone of American dramas. From a perspective of a Chinese, it is understandable that westerners couldn't produce the original Three-Body Problem because the core of Western and Chinese cultures is different, but that doesn't mean the series is bad. Generally speaking, the plot has not completely departed from the original work, in fact, it followed the original book and kept every important messages, the minor changes are just for the habits and values for Western audiences, so overall it deserves a high score, plus the visual effects are quite good!

"Being a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was excited to check out this new hyped up sci-fi series. It starts of really well and hooked me right away. The first few episodes build so much intrigue and speculation.Then the show grinds nearly to a halt. There is little to no story progression. We focus on ridiculously annoying subplots. I could feel myself caring less by the minute.The final few episodes ramp back up with more frequent major plot points, but it's too late. The show already lost me. And there are a bunch of things that don't really make sense. I don't think I'll be checking out season 2.(1 viewing, 4/15/2024)SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSThere are a few things that don't work or that I find hard to believe. For example, people who dedicate their life to science discover aliens, and their immediate reaction is, ""They are my Gods.""Then they do this thing where maybe the aliens aren't so bad, until a huge reveal of, ""you are bugs."" The problem is, they already told us from the beginning that the aliens will be bad for us. The pacifist alien says not to contact them or Earth will be conquered. They should have either left the possibility of peaceful aliens open until ""you are bugs."" Or stop acting like it's not already known by the audience.Then their is a mission to steal the communications with the aliens. They say they can't storm the boat with special forces because it will be a bloodbath and the passengers might destroy the data. And they can't use a missile strike or they might destroy the data themselves.So they come up with a plan to use nanofibers to destroy the boat. Which is a total bloodbath. Which also may have destroyed the data itself. Which also gives the passengers enough time to destroy the data. The fact that this idiotic plan succeeds is pure dumb luck.The annoying subplots I mentioned are the cancer patient and the love triangle he's a part of. Luckily it ended up playing a part in the plot. But we definitely didn't need to spend that much time with him dealing with his mortality. Or deciding if he wants to profess his love to his unavailable ex. Or imagining himself in a paper boat smh.",IMDB,3 Body Problem's problems (spoilers after a warning),4.0

The story requires your attention to ensure you don't miss subtle cues and hints, that then unfold in the following episodes.The writing is engaging and leaves you asking questions and trying to figure out the next episodes before you've finished the current one. I wasn't even aware this was based on a trilogy of novels before watching, but can now understand why they have also shot to number 1 on the best sellers list this week.The casting, acting and direction are excellent and well worth a watch if you are prepared to pay attention and have a mild interest in science.This show has the potential to become an all time favourite.However season 2 could be make or break depending on what direction is taken with San-ti.",IMDB,Season 2 needed now!,10.0
"It has been 6-7 years since I read the novels this series is based on. I think it is one of the most remarkable science-fiction series written in the last few decades. That being said I did not start watching this show with the books in mind. I knew there would be necessary changes and deviations for a different format. I will not judge the show on how it holds up to the books, I will judge it for how well it tells a story.And I am faily impressed with how the first season unfolds. The story often jogged my memory of scenes and events that I had forgotten from the novel but because I watched the first five episodes twice (because when you decide to watch something with someone and that someone falls asleep and you cant stop watching despite of it and have to rewatch again the next day to allow them to catch up 😄) I realized there were many subtle scenes that went past me in the first viewing. Scenes that hint how the story will unfold in the next two seasons (assuming there will be one season for each novel) and what part some characters will play therein.It is not a flawless adaptation, there were a couple of scenes that I felt my suspension of disbelief tested (canal scene, not because of the tech involved but I felt the execution less elaborate than it should have been) but I'm willing to look past it for the bigger picture.I dont have many memories of the characters in the novels, that's fine. It's not really a character driven story. But I did remember Da Shi and I was dilighted to see Benedict Wong in that role. I enjoyed every second of him on screen.

"Remember this is just a Science Fiction film and never to be taken to be real factual or close to real life in any way. This is called entertainment. With that said, in reality, if a civilization that is Type 3, like the one we were witnessing in this TV show, ever existed, they could already terraform and create an Earth out of any planet in any solar system out of the trillions of solar systems in the vast stars in the cosmos. It is also theorized that such a race of beings could create a Dyson sphere by mining the asteroid minerals of the adjacent systems. Before you embark on this journey of belief, you must alleviate all belief that we have some self-importance in the universe. What importance are we to any race of beings? We are just 0.00000001 of a trillions of nothing to anything in the known universe, so get it into your head that we are unnecessary.

And there are, to be honest, a lot of deviations from the books, mostly in terms of characters and their relationships - characters are changed a bit, some are a combination of multiple characters, some are completely new and the same applies to interactions. But there are many moments that were really close or almost the same as the original, which I truly appreciate, because seeing some of the iconic moments on TV was great. Now, it's up to everybody's preference if they mind the changes or not. For me, some were ok, reasonable, other were quite unnecessary. One thing that could be a problem is pacing, sometimes it felt a bit too fast, other times it felt too slow.Then there is the whole thing regarding the theme and the story, and that it is quite complicated and sometimes even absolutely crazy (3rd book), but hey I get it, it's not for everyone, so watch/read something else, it's understandable. But I would like to see Netflix give a green light to more seasons, because there are some epic (and crazy) things waiting for viewers - especially THAT absurdly crazy moment near the end of the 3rd book (if you know, you know).",IMDB,"As a fan of the books, I enjoyed this adaptation",8.0
"After a binge watch, wanting a second season. The cost for each episode is ridiculous! I hope viewers tell others to watch. I have not read the books, so I wasn't disappointed in the show.The concept is amazing and the idea of aliens approaching after our life time makes you wonder. Would we work to save future generations? I hope so!The technology to send Will's brain into space, amazing, with the nuclear bombs and sail. I wish my intellect was like that!The character who decided she had the right to decide for mankind had good intentions, but didn't heed the alien warning. Now future generations will pay the price. Please season 2 Netflix!",IMDB,Waiting for season 2,8.0
"In my experience this is a work on its own. If you have read the books and/or watched the chinese TV-series you might be disappointed, it depends on what you were expecting. But this is not those things.The Netflix TV-series is compressed, very compressed. Nevertheless I think it gets the ideas from the books through. And if you know nothing of the books or the chinese version you could appreciate it as it is, provided that you like scifi that is more than gunfights with laser pistols.There is also some regular human conflicts as in almost all TV-shows, and I think those are believable or at least watchable. They have even managed to be funny at moments but that haven't disturbed my suspension of disbelief.",IMDB,"A story on its own, not a book",8.0
"I gave it out of 10 on 10. The actors played their role amazingly ....Though little bit flaw of ages of scientist. But this is fiction and every generation considered more intellectual. So this flaw is cut out easily. When I watched 1st episodes , i just could not blinking my eyes and my adrenaline rush when the gameverse mode is on, thinking what's might be the solution of 3 body problem and what coming next . That's the beauty of a show to hold your suspense firmly and compelled you to lost in their fiction world. Every bit of scene is important and not a single piece of scene is boring or stretched out . The scientific logic and with little humor balancing the story . Neither too dark neither too light. The show runner absolutely did their job . Don't judge by the IMDb or rotten tomato score. Just give it a chance. You might be get a chance to think how we overcome from this situation when enemy is so powerful and intellectual . Answer lies in our humanity , surrounded by our deep down society or in between our flourished civilization or deep dark mind. Waiting for 2nd season ...

"If you're a fan of the original series:
DO NOT WATCH IT.DO NOT WATCH IT.DO NOT WATCH IT.Why simplying Ye's story and make up unnecessary drama out of her? Why slicing and combining plots almost randomly among the characters and rearranging them like a mixed salad? Why???As a big fan of the original series, I do admit that SOME of the characters lack a bit of depth BUT Cixin Liu did an amazing job in Ye's story.Her whole lifetime, not just the ups and downs, but also her own experiences with different people, both before and after she pushed the button, builds up the COMPLEXITY in her.In this version, all I can see is ""See how harsh that revolution was? That's why she decided to revenge!""

"I brought the book, but the Chinese names and characters were hard for me to understand. So started watching the Netflix series instead, first episode was boring. But the story and twists are very interesting as I have also written similar story concepts when I was 13. This series definitely promotes us "" Homo Sapiens"", but also people who believe more in "" San Ti"". Jin's character is very well developed. I hope season 2 comes up soon. Episode 6 was absolutely amazing also the 4th one. I find Auggie's character annoying, as they that they don't seem to care.

"I am a huge fan of the RoEP trilogy, and had always wanted to watch this show so hard that I binged it as soon as it came out.On the one hand, the original book is a masterpiece for me. So I desperately wanted to see them do it justice. By that I mean, I want to see a show giving an epic vibe as the book gives.On the other hand, I had literally watched all the trailers and teasers and some reviews before it's out. Thus I was sort of clear what to expect. I wasn't that disappointed as some readers.Therefore, I will just be straightforward on what I like and not.Pros:
the pacy storyline.D&D did a good at the intense plot development. I couldn't stop watching until episode 6. ( I don't mean that Episode6-8 are worse, it's just a little bit slowed down, which is not a bad thing)three-body game and sophon unfoldingAlthough I felt a bit upset that they changed Emperor Qin and Von Neumann to Khan and Turing, but they did a overall amazing job portraying these.-Early appearance of the protagonists
It is a smart move by diving Wang so that Cheng and Luo can be out earlier.Some characters I found better than book.Cheng - her playing the game, chemicals with Will are smooth and enjoyable.Jack - He's funnier and much more important than in the book. And his death is really great adaptation. But he leaving half of his legacy to a friend is less convincible.Will - He is well-portrayed as a new character, although I felt he's not like Yun Tianming enough by having so many friends. It's absolutely Okay since no one is really like their original character.Wade- He is a good guy overall. Although I was expecting a badass who would send his mother to a whorehouse.Cons:
I am not sure I can put it precisely. It is just the way they face the greatest crisis of human race of all time make the crisis look less grand. The investigation of scientist death, the Judgement Day, the Staircase Project, all conducted by Wade's team. It's Wade vs aliens or humanity vs aliens? Moreover, the Wallfacer Project, why do they change all the wallfacers? Why?? I don't see the necessity to change them with much boring characters.Honestly, I will give it 7.5/10, but considering the difficulty in adapting RoEP and that I really want to see the season 2 and 3 no matter how the season 1 goes, I give it 10/10 here.",IMDB,Mixed Feeling,10.0
"If you haven't read the books, this is a really good sci-fi show. For those that have read them, how much you enjoy the show will largely depend how well you can remove yourself from your experience of the books. It more alludes to the really sciency stuff, but that's ok..the books aren't for everyone. The show does a very good job of finding the happy middle ground of those that have and have not read the books. They've amalgamated and created characters and I hate when shows take liberties with source material ie LoTr, Wheel of Time etc and yet it feels like clever writing to do so here. Otherwise it would be a sprawling list of often needless and short-lived characters.",IMDB,Great IF you can detach yourself from the books.,8.0
"3 Body ProblemHalf way through watching this amazing science fiction story, I found out that 3 Body Problem was part of a series of books. Obviously, this means I haven't read it, so I went into the show with no information.The actual 3 body problem, in physics, is fascinating to read about. I won't go into it here, but you can find out information on wikipedia. We learn that a Chinese scientist works with the government in the 1970s to make contact with an alien species. At this point, the show really reminded me of the movie Contact with Jodie Foster.When the show returns to the present, the science fiction aspect of the looming threat of the aliens tends to take a back seat as the tale of humanity comes forth. This show really tugged on my heartstrings watching the interpersonal relationships between the main characters.As we learn throughout the episodes, the young scientists are exposed to a form of a video game where they are tested to solve scientific problems. The twists and turns that follow are so much fun to watch. I don't want to spoil anything, since the show is so new to Netflix. It's highly recommended because it doesn't just concentrate on an alien invasion, but has themes of love, morality and sacrifice.",IMDB,"More than science fiction, an emotional story of humanity.",9.0

"I was looking forward to this, something that promised to be an interesting take on hard-science what iffery. Not having read the books, I don't have any axe to grind with how good or not the adaption is - I just want to be entertained with compelling characters, interesting ideas, and just maybe a Netflix show that delivers on its promise.What we have here is a failure to communicate anything of substance. Catwalk pretty scientists allude to wikisearch results with all the depth of a Mr Men episode - simply referencing the existence of hard science does not make it that kind of show. Good looking young people ramp their expositional acting all the way up to 3 by way of first-take it'll-do directing. It really does not help with the dialogue has everyone talk with the same voice; there is no nuance between any of the characters, except Liam Cunningham who drops the C bomb every so often because he's Irish and that worked well for him in GoT.Anyway: somewhere out there, there are God like beings far more advanced than we can imagine. They are coming. They may get here sooner than Jesus, they may not. Hopefully both arrive at the same time and there's a proper religion V science kick-off. Neither can come soon enough if this show is any barometer of the smarts humanity allegedly possesses.Rich people want to be best positioned to take advantage, and will do whatever it takes to make that happen while creating more plot-holes per minute than any other show in living memory.The special effects are Dr Whovian, circa 2005.That's pretty much it.Enjoy.",IMDB,YA Science & Catwalk Casting,4.0

I really want a second season to happen, and see how the creators can take it to the next level. It has its jawdrop moments, it has its tearful moments. Yes it has taken on some liberties on how to adapt the original materials, but I think they did it well enough such that it can be more accessible to a greater audience, while remaining loyal to the ideas of the series.

"I've red the books - absolute masterpeces! Go do it, you'll thank yourself..And as for these series - they're but a far cry compared to books! Yet that's expected, when studios try to make a series out of masterpieces, so I would still watch them.I honestly tried. But even in the first episode I was bombarded with ""The Message"", harshly deviating from the story in the books, not once - multiple times, and when I finally realized they have twisted the plot, to the point of changing some characters to accommodate ""the Message"" - that's when I couldn't continue any further.Filming seems good. Actors doing their job well.

Where the show lacks (in depth explanation of the science) the books do great. I still prefer the books, but the show is not the hot mess that some people are making it out to be.The visuals are great, the acting is fantastic, the story follows the first 1.25 books pretty close with some intro into 3rd book characters. As a series that goes back and forth in the timeline with different characters in every book, this is the correct way to adapt something of this scale.All in all, even if you aren't a science fiction fan, this is a really interesting first season and I'm pleading with Netflix to continue developing the show.",IMDB,All up to personal preference,9.0

It gives it a much fresher perspective and way more depth to the characters.Also the Chinese cultural dimension, which is very present in the books is well preserved which is another bonus.Overall totally great watch and probably the best SF series of the year.

The stars literally looked like the kind you stick on your ceiling. Hopefully this will expand to be even better in the future but so far I find it to be decent but not great.

"The ""3 Body Problem"" TV series is a commendable attempt and an improvement on the original book series. However, I had reservations about the source material, which seemed overly fixated on human characters, primarily of Chinese origin, from the 2000s. Even when the narrative leaps into an ""artificial"" universe billions of years in the future, the protagonist's lifestyle remains strikingly similar to that of rural China or Kentucky in the 1980s. This, to me, suggests a lack of diverse life experiences and imaginative depth on the author's part, confining the narrative to the boundaries of his personal experiences.The book's portrayal of intelligent species felt like a disservice, as all characters, regardless of their supposed future Russian or American identities, seemed to retain the mindset of 1980s China. The recurring theme of the traditional Chinese family ideal, which often plays a pivotal role in the storyline, can be challenging to grasp for Western readers and even younger Asian readers, I believe. This traditional family model, featuring a man, a woman, and numerous servants, persists even at the story's conclusion, which I found rather unsettling.The TV show, unfortunately, shares a similar issue, with all main characters hailing from the UK and being interconnected. While this isn't a significant improvement from the book, it does feel more plausible, considering that creative problem solvers are more likely to emerge from democratic societies than authoritarian ones. The characters in the series are more relatable and exhibit greater depth in terms of their personalities and motivations. However, the show falls short in its handling of the scientific aspects, but given the poor foundation laid by the source material, there wasn't much room for improvement.",IMDB,A Mixed Bag,10.0
"I have read only the first book, it is a work of art. I had not been so thrilled since I read Neuromancer back in '84. So, to the Nettflix series, fingers crossed, waiting, until I could watch it. I came with mixed expectations. After all, Netflix did a fairly good job with Altered Carbon, right? Ok NOOOOO... I am sorely dissapointed, to put it politely. Just no respect with the source material, it is not enough to keep some plot points, it is the overall concept, the beauty of the narration, the science, everything!. To convert it to a soap opear is just a capita sin. In a previous review I read ""Just enough changes to make it more digestible for a TV audience"". Translation: ""just dumbed down for a stupider audience"", like it is a good thing. Since when a TV audience is less intelligent than book readers? You are making a TV series, you have all the time in the world to explain everything! And of course, the mandatory changes in genders and races, so the appropiate equality quota is fulfilled. ""Men bad, women good"". PC trash again. I think we were lucky that this was not directed by Jerry Bruckheimer... Now, I have ZERO hopes for the upcoming Neuromancer adaptation in Apple+.

I think the show is great. It is nice to the see the characters and the story come to life in a series. My family though who have not read the books seem to even more enjoy the series whereas the tension is half part of it.I hope there is a part 2 of the series where we can see the evolvement of society in the context of the deterrence situation and collaboration with the trisolarans. Hopefully it won't be cancelled because imo it will only get better.Also the last book brings a whole new situation in the trilogy so no season will be like the other which I think will be great!Fingers crossed for Netflix!,IMDB,"Loved the book, but the show would be much more intense if not read",10.0

"There has been a run of good SF on Apple TV, although the peculiar pacing and quantumisation of ""Constellation"" has been a disappointment. I like ""Foundation"", and love ""For All Mankind"". But for me this show Despite the flaws of the books, the first season of ""3 Body Problem"" is a gem, the best SF on TV possibly ever, it's definitely everything that's apple SF shows want to be,: emotional , characters, an accelerating plot, mystery and excellent effects, the better for being carefully placed and paced. Its SF tropes are not original, and its physics is, as far as we know, wrong in several places (even if they are places that the literature of SF has gone several times before), but the mixture is new, and hangs together. The difficulty, I guess, is that the ""wow!"" moments and those delightful flashes where the science appears a minute or two after you have worked out what's coming are skewed to those of us whi have scienced the **** out of things for far too long.",IMDB,"Best sci-fi show in a decade, totally underrated!",10.0

For me, it worked. I liked the friends, and thought their relationships were true to life.There was enough science to spark interest, but I could have used even more. I also loved the use of the video game to advance the story.

If Liu Cixin, the author of The Three-Body Problem, had used the script written by these two superficial screenwriters, he would definitely not have been able to win the Hugo Award, and his status in the science fiction community would have plummeted to the bottom.",IMDB,It's not worth watching. The scriptwriter's level is extremely poor.,1.0
"TLDR: I had a great time watching the show and binged it all within the first 24 hours. This is must watch show, nearly perfectly executed, with a few explainability issues.The Bad:
I had read the first book a few years prior and remember just being blown away by the science and concepts depicted. The story was incredible. The show does a decent job handling these concepts but unfortunately cannot hit the same level of detail a book can and as a result the concepts lie under-explored and doesnt drop jaws like it had in the book. There were also many times where I had questions about the reasoning behind various decisions made and had to just trust that it made sense because the show didnt explain it thoroughly enough to the viewer. Later, googling the details, someone who recently read the book would have to fill in the details why/how certain decisions made sense (for me, episode 5 left me with some questions I had to google- ex: why was this approach so much better than others?). I feel like this area couldve been done much better.The Good:
Everything else pretty much. Music is incredible. Initial thriller mystery is well done and captures your attention. Actors are great. It had everything that kept me hitting ""Next Episode"" well into the late night.The show writers did a great job adapting a very difficult book to adapt into a show with characters who are like able and understandable.Overall, I highly recommend this show to everyone with the caveat that you may need to google some things (and hopefully avoid spoilers) to further explain the reasoning and logic behind some of the character decisions. I REALLY hope Netflix renews this for season 2 as this is the best and highest quality Netflix show I have seen in quite some time- perhaps since the golden days of House of Cards.",IMDB,Fantastic and fun adaption- review by a book reader,9.0
"It was one random day when I was scrolling through YouTube feed and then suddenly stumbled across the trailer for this show. It is no exaggeration but the moment I saw the trailer I was absolutely hooked!Now that I have completed watching all eight episodes of this AMAZNG series, I just can't wait for the future season. It's been a long time since I have seen such an experimental series. It is a wonderfully crafted concept, put out to us viewers through a very interesting take of storytelling.Maybe most of the people watching this would say that they liked the universal aspect of the show, for me, the character emotions were a major hooking factor. Naturally being a fan of Netflix's renowned hit series Dark, I went in with high expectations and it's fair to say I was not only satisfied but also AMAZED by the storytelling brilliance of this series. One problem I had with Dark was that in the beginning stages of Dark I felt no such emotional connections with the characters, which is totally opposite in case of this series.The character of Will was absolutely Perfect.Will be waiting for the future season!",IMDB,Expectations overturned,9.0

At $ 20 million an episode and there are 8 in season 1, it cost Netflix $ 160 million for season one. Their most expensive sci-fi series ever. All three seasons would be almost half a billion dollars!The writers and producers are the ones who did Game of Thrones and they have done an amazing job. The script is tight and the dialogue is so crisp.I read all three books and loved them and season one did the first book justice. The visuals are amazing and there is terrific depth of character and wonderful interaction among the characters.The second book is even better but Netflix needs to see excellent ratings to commission the second season.

I binge-watched this within two days while working and it was quite a distraction.The topic is something new that I haven't seen in other movies or TV shows. It was very well executed. The characters are likable and interesting. There is enough character depth that makes you know each individual and be interested in their story.You could say that there are a few things here and there, such as the rather mild reactions by individual characters to something as extraordinary as an extraterrestrial device, but these are minor aspects that are less important compared to the heavy story and the very intriguing underlying plot.I can't wait to see what comes next.",IMDB,Addicting and different,8.0
"I absolutely loved this show, it's classic sci-fi come to life on screen with STUNNING visuals. It's leisurely, you really get to know each character and their motivations, I wanted to sit and absorb every minute of this show and I didn't want it to end. But at the same time it's thrilling, and fascinating, I loved the science and the technology, but also the moral and ethical dilemmas too. It grabs your heart and crushes it into tiny pieces, it's emotional and heartfelt, and I love that the characters are so morally grey as well. No one is perfect and that's exactly what we need in a show like this to make it realistic and believable. But the thing I love the most is how the plot is made up of individual threads that brought together to epic conclusions, in that way it gives me Game of Thrones vibes.

And all those political correctness is way too forced, after all, I think they just don't believe a true great story has universal attraction, despite the background or the origin of the story, so they put all those hollywood cliche adaptions in it expecting us to like it, SO WRONG!",IMDB,Terrible adaption,3.0
"Although it is hard to cover all three books season one is beautifully delivered. It is cinematically stunning and presented beautifully. The cast is superb and high-level acting. The sets, costumes and music blend perfectly taking you into the other worldly story. It is seductive and makes me want more for sure. Big thumbs up to set directors, set deck, builders and cinematography staff as well as the whole creative team. This feels like the pull of GOT and has us awaiting with bated breath for next episodes. I think this is a Netflix at its best and hope that you can deliver a season two and three and even more.",IMDB,Must Watch!,10.0
"Just finished binging season 1 which I have been waiting for since I read the books. There are some really interesting thoughts in the books, and I think the tv show managed to keep them interesting. This is not a budget show, and I wish Netflix would make a lot fewer shows that is clearly low budget and spend more on quality. The 3 body problem is thrilling, entertaining and visualize the books in a good way so far. Also pretty good acting, all though a little shallow characters so far. I would appreciate more complex characters for the next season. Food for thoughts, never the less, so well done Netflix, and please start shooting for season 2 very soon!",IMDB,Absolutely worth watching. Looking forward to season 2,10.0
"I'm enjoying this screen adaptation. I also enjoyed the book. My recommendation is that if you plan on reading the book, it would be better to do that first before watching the series. This is because the suspense of the book depends on the reader not knowing anything much about it. I read the book not even knowing what it was about, except that Barack Obama loved it, and that was a really fun way to get my mind blown as I flipped through the pages.The first book is a mystery sci fi thriller and this first series largely spans that. I think they could have stretched it out to 10 episodes and simply allowed the first 3 episodes to be purposely slow, mysterious and increasingly unsettling.The introduction of numerous new characters definitely is a better way to tell the story on screen. I wish that the characters were built better though, allowing some mundane scenes in order for the audience to better relate with the characters. The actors were strong but I feel like it would have been better if certain characters had very plain 'ordinary' looking faces. Eg. Theres something both scary and believable when a villain looks like anybody on the bus you take to work rather than a AAA supermodel.Theres alot of CGI and it's a hate it or love it thing. They do sacrifice the science from the book to create better action and visually impressive scenes. However, I hope that doesn't leave an impression upon hard core sci fi fans, making them feel this is cartoon Hollywood science.",IMDB,More fun than the book. Less intense though.,9.0
"It's a great adaptation for streaming media needs while staying true to the essence of the original. Really looking forward to the next part.I hope those who say the series isn't faithful to the original won't be so fixated. The novel's settings are all in China, but Netflix needs to adapt it to resonate with sci-fi fans across various countries and regions. The vast majority of the audience, I believe, hasn't read the original and there's no need to be obsessed with perfectly replicating the original novel.The character relationships in ""Oxford 5"" are somewhat complex and lengthy. Additionally, the last three episodes slightly drop in quality compared to the earlier ones, but it doesn't detract from the season being an excellent work overall. It feels like a thorough foundation has been laid for the second season.",IMDB,An excellent sci-fi production,10.0
So around episode 6 you realize that they aren't going to end up getting far enough in the story to land in the right place. Unfortunately they spend too much time in the 60's and that entire story line becomes irrelevant the further they go. It ends at an unnatural place with it feeling like a lot of time was wasted on plot lines that are unimportant. The story is good overall and most of the CGI is quality. With the exception of a monkey that is so terrible that you're amazed that Netflix didn't step in and remove it. Im serious..... It's that jarringly bad. Overall it's very ambitious but after Dune pt 2 it's hard not to be a little let down with the 8 hours they use to lay it all out. Could've used 2 more episodes and actual resolution of at least one plot line.,IMDB,Very good but they don't stick the landing,10.0

"Having listened to all 3 Books in the 3 Body Problem I've been hoping to see it visually. I was also scared because the important depths and nuances of the books can so easily be erased or glossed over that it makes the thing a mess (see 1984 Dune). While there are changes to make it appealing to a Western audience (ie, set in UK v China) and the usual name changes & character lumping, I'm walking away satisfied. Could it benefit from 10 episodes? Yes. I hope that if Netflix pushes forward w/ adapting Dark Forest that it does just that.If you haven't read the books and enjoy sci-fi that has roots in real science, I strongly encourage you to read/listen to the books first only to better appreciate & understand the broader story.If you prefer to watch sci-series that are not just popcorn events but cast light onto the human condition, this is for you (and it's ok to eat as much popcorn as you'd like).Other Netflix series I'd put in same category are Dark & The Rain. Stranger Things and Wednesday this is not, even those are also very good.",IMDB,3 Body Problem does not equal Complete Adaptation Problem,8.0
"I have to admit that I have read the book but very fast and I can't remember almost anything... Thanks to this Netflix TV show, it helps me pick up something, and gives me new feeling about the story. I know there are some modifications, and as for me they are reasonable and possitive.What I don't like is the show uses so much money that please, make every episode sames as 8 (Judgement Day). That one is really awesome and present the best part of San Ti, shows us how to cut a ship with fiber. It makes dream become true!Overall, it's a must see show. Please add funding to next season and make it same great as episode S01E08.",IMDB,I haven't read the book carefully,8.0
"From contentious China in the 60s to modern times, a deep and incomprehensible scientific truth became the focus of ""3 Body Problem"" season one. A major extinction-level threat was incoming, and it was up to a handful of scientists to go where their own science feared to tread.Particle Physics wasn't functioning like it was 'supposed' to. Select experiments all over the world were showing results that went against prominent theoretical models for those self-same tests. This created divisions and tensions among varied scientists as to what it all implied for the future of humankind.As complex as it all was, season 1 delivered great suspense and kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting to know more about what was going on, and where things would go.The story was adapted from Cixin Liu's novels after the same name, making me want to add the books to my reading list.The many characters in ""3 Body Problem"" slowly and unwittingly created a web that linked most of them to the problem in question. I thought that was outstanding screenplay, one that distinguished this show from most others like it.All the artists did great work bringing their respective characters to life. The cast genuinely felt entwined with the script. Removing one or more of them would have unravelled the plot and done it no justice.Strange futuristic VR headsets, a LED-style timer that appeared in the middle of the air to some people, scientists being targeted for reasons and causes unknown, inexplicable suicides, and an extensive hidden web connecting all these seemingly disparate elements into a cohesive possibility...
""3 Body Problem"" genuinely took storytelling to weird heights without compromising entertainment value. Though some of the relationships and romances weren't compelling enough, the series managed to check off several different boxes.So much of this storyline tied in with the long-standing Simulation Theory and its myriad hypothetical possibilities. There was also an admirable underlayer pertaining to conservation, preservation, and balance that set a good tone throughout the series. The not-so-subtle concept of using VR to bring together some of the brightest scientific minds enriched the subtext and actual plotline of ""3 Body Problem"".The title had something interesting to do with how three solar bodies could be influencing 'chaotic' and 'stable' eras in varied timelines, thereby directly affecting different civilizations - within the VR-based game, at any rate.Each 'player' had to be exclusively invited, at which point a box containing the VR headset would be delivered to their doorstep, sender unknown.The so-called game brought together random players with familiar in-game scientist names. I wish they explored this angle some more, because some of it came across as abrupt.The Science-Fiction logic and Fantasy-based creativity that defined the incoming aliens' plan was compelling in ways that have to be seen to be appreciated. This was the core make-or-break factor in ""3 Body Problem"", and they made it work.What I didn't like about the series was how much time they wasted catering to human vanity and weak-empathy instead of focusing on the bigger picture.In light of a species-wide extinction event - even one that was coming only hundreds of years later, as light travel dictated - it was strange to see some of the core characters standing vehemently opposed to instances where the ends truly would justify the means and where the loss of a few to save many would genuinely matter.Anyway, ""3 Body Problem"" delivered a good dose of emphatic suspense. It took a potential 'aliens may not be our friends' scenario and made it seem credible, which was a big win for a series like this in a genre that's been tweaking that very angle for decades.Season 2 has plenty of room to deliver some high-octane shock-n-awe value. The elegant finale in ""3 Body Problem"" S01 has left me eager to know what our intrepid 'bugs' aim to do next.",IMDB,A Stellar Portrayal Of Science Threatened - Season 1 Review,8.0
"I haven't read the books, and although I had tried to watch the original Chinese series, I couldn't find it.I found the basic concept very engaging, and the way the series is presented, I'd say until episode 5, makes for a really entertaining watch. I do enjoy the science behind the story, but that's not the main point, which is good for non-scientists. It's not for your average Marvel fan, as especially the first episode is kinda slow, but it picks up after that and grips you strongly.But the series is not without its flaws, and apart from a couple of actors not really up to par, there's one thing that I couldn't get around, that I haven't seen in other reviews: the CGI. It's so terrible it's amazing! I can't understand how a show with so many resources put into it has such poor CGI, and it's clearly visible in a few episodes. It reminds me of Planet of the Apes, which came out so many years ago (you'll know why I say this when you see it).I still give it an 8 for the engaging story and (some) solid acting, but it could have been better.",IMDB,"Engaging, thought-provoking but flawed at times",8.0
"I've read the whole english version of Remembrance of the Earth's Past trilogy before watching this show. Never watched the Chinese version. When writing this, I'm only up to episode 6.Overall, it's a decent adaptation. Not a direct adaptation. Characters were set up decently. The pacing is similar to the first book. However, it wasn't as emotionally gripping. Emotional beats were subtle, like BBC shows.The huge flaw of the series is that young-Ye Wenji encounters were not heavy-handed compared to the novel. In the novel, many people (I think mainly were CCP members) she encountered were selfish petty despicable hypocrites. And she went through a lot and saw the dark side of humanity firsthand, not just the Cultural Revolution scene in the trailer. Thus, made me sympathized her decision and her action to protect that decision. I hate the ""humanity"" in her eyes with her when reading.That segment was too tamed. It wasn't intense enough to make me lose faith in humanity to the point that I sympathized her decision.I hope the upcoming season or seasons would be less tamed and more intense.",IMDB,"Decent BBC-like adaptation, but too toned down",8.0
"Its so slow, i had to watch it on 1.5x speed. It would be okay if the show had some semblance of tension or interest, but it doesnt, all it has is annoying and bland characters. I cant remember any of their names, and all their problems seem so trivial, and they completely ignore the one problem that actually seems important. Theyre stereotypes of 'the genius scientist' like the guy who constantly says things like ""its a deepfake"" as if a scientist would ever believe someone could deepfake the STARS BLINKING GLOBALLY. Like seriously? And that asian girl actually thinking its a VR game like are these characters stupid? Anyone would figure out that that weird helmet thingy is not a simple VR game.

"A lot of the critics reviews did not even understand the show. Many criticise that Oxford 5 is meant to replace 1 guy. Meaning 1 guy in the book is replaced by 5 person.That is not true. Oxford 5 are a mixture of a few people. Even Jack was a character from book 3. And they criticised Saul that he does nothing. He was a good friend to will and will be important in book 2. I just wish critics understood the show better before giving misleading reviews.Some are fair and said that not enough time given to Dr ye and bendict wong character but the budget is for 8 episodes so some sacrifice must be made.Then some are saying the 30 episodes China version is better. Come on that has lower budget, worse actors and visual effects and most importantly drag 30 episodes just to get to episode 5 in this show. Do you really want that?Overall this version is good enough and brings the fascinating concepts in the book to international audience.",IMDB,Critics got it wrong !,10.0
"""The Three-Body Problem"" is indeed a remarkable science fiction novel written by Chinese author Liu Cixin. The story explores themes related to the existence of extra-terrestrial life and humanity's place in the universe. It is a masterpiece of speculative fiction that transcends genre boundaries and cultural divides to offer a profound meditation on the existence of extra-terrestrial life. Through its meticulous attention to detail, rich thematic exploration, and visionary storytelling, the story continues to captivate readers and inspire awe at the vastness and mystery of the cosmos.1. Cultural Context: One of its unique strengths is its grounding in Chinese culture and history. Liu Cixin seamlessly weaves elements of Chinese philosophy, mythology, and historical events into the narrative, offering readers a perspective that differs from the predominantly Western-centric portrayals of alien encounters in science fiction. This cultural richness adds depth to the story and enriches the exploration of humanity's response to contact with extra-terrestrial civilisations.2. Scientific Rigor: Liu Cixin's background as a computer engineer informs his approach to science fiction writing, resulting in a narrative that is steeped in scientific accuracy and plausibility. The story incorporates concepts from physics, astronomy, and other scientific disciplines, presenting a compelling vision of how humanity might discover and interact with alien life forms. Liu Cixin enhances the sense of realism and credibility, inviting readers to contemplate the possibility of encountering extra-terrestrial intelligence.3. Philosophical Depth: ""The Three-Body Problem"" is not merely a tale of alien contact; it is also a philosophical exploration of humanity's place in the cosmos. The story raises profound questions about the nature of civilisation, the limits of human knowledge, and the ethical dilemmas posed by advanced technology. Through the experiences of its characters, the story prompts readers to reflect on their own beliefs and values, inviting them to consider the implications of our existence within the vast expanse of the universe.4. Narrative Complexity: The story intricate plot unfolds across multiple timelines and perspectives, creating a rich tapestry of interconnected storylines. Liu Cixin masterfully integrates elements of mystery, intrigue, and suspense, keeping readers engaged as they piece together the puzzle of humanity's encounter with the enigmatic Trisolaran civilisation. The narrative complexity adds layers of depth to the exploration of extra-terrestrial life, offering readers a multifaceted portrayal of the challenges and opportunities that arise from contact with alien beings.5. Global Impact: ""The Three-Body Problem"" has transcended cultural and linguistic boundaries to become a seminal work of science fiction with a global audience. Its success has helped to spotlight Chinese science fiction on the international stage, fostering cross-cultural dialogue and exchange within the genre.In summary, ""The Three-Body Problem"" is a brilliant take on the existence of extra-terrestrial life in the vast universe due to its cultural richness, scientific rigor, philosophical depth, narrative complexity, and global impact. By blending these elements together, Liu Cixin has crafted a thought-provoking and immersive exploration of one of humanity's most enduring questions: Are we alone in the cosmos...",IMDB,The Cosmic Brilliance of 'The Three-Body Problem',9.0
"I have read the books, loved them and seen the other adaptations. Nothing on screen will ever come close to the wild scope and imagination of the book, but this is an excellent adaptation. And, more importantly - a terrific series on its own merit. If you like weird science fiction mystery and concepts of scale that kick your brain around, this is way, way beyond what is currently out there.I can divide myself into two for this review. #1 is Book Reader - and I could easily be drawn into thinking this is rushed, smoothed out and watered down in a sense.But #2 me knows that's kind of required here. The 3 body problem series is ridiculous and that's why so many readers adore it. The books do not follow a familar structure nor rhythm. It meanders then it explodes, without any warning. And it's overall timeline is nuts.Brilliant and utterly thought provoking... but nuts.So, then to make it palatable (and worth the money) for a new audience on TV, concessions need to be made. And thats what we have here.From what I can see, the negative sentiment is rooted in this bitter taste the producers left in the mouth of Game of Thrones fans. That, and the deviations from the book. That is to me, extremely myopic and doesn't fairly give this justice. It's not perfect - but it's science fiction done well enough not to alienate general audiences, but also to be respectful of the source material.",IMDB,Compelling!,9.0
"I read the books 8 years ago. I was blown away by the scope and genius of the work. I'd highly recommend reading the books. That said, I think this series does a great job of presenting this very complex work. I was very entertained and enjoyed re-living the work on screen. I think they're hitting the mark on several levels. The production is good. They do a good job of showing the human frailties that drive the narrative. And I like the way new plot lines (and devices) are presented as mysteries and surprises. Kind of like the books, you find yourself surprised at the inventiveness of the author. I'm looking forward to follow-up seasons.",IMDB,Good & entertaining adaptation!,10.0
"The Netflix adaptation of the book falls short in capturing its essence. In my view, it only manages to represent a mere 20% of the book's rich ideas. The book's primary aim is to provoke thought and reflection on our historical arrogance and mistakes, urging us not to take our current privileges for granted. It spans a broad spectrum of disciplines, including philosophy, physics, sociology, and cosmology, and is laden with profound ideas presented both overtly and metaphorically. These concepts demand intellectual engagement from the reader, akin to peeling back layers to reach the fruit's core, rather than settling for the superficial peel.It's important to note that the book primarily targets a Chinese audience, (which may explain certain elements that could be perceived as racially insensitive) and elite scientists or politicians, which may pose a challenge for the general public to fully grasp all the nuanced ideas. However, the more one delves into the book, the more intriguing it becomes.Turning to the Netflix series, it unfortunately does a disservice to the original work. It strays significantly from the source material, with less than 20% plot consistency, and alters key elements to the point of being unrecognizable as 'The Three-Body Problem'. Moreover, it fails to translate the book's philosophical underpinnings, which are its core. While the book is categorized as science fiction, this genre serves more as an entry point to engage with its deeper philosophical themes, rather than the main attraction.Netflix's adaptation not only neglects these core ideas but also oversimplifies the story, rendering the characters one-dimensional and illogical. The book offers intricate depictions of each character's internal struggles, with their unique traits providing logical explanations for their actions. In contrast, the Netflix portrayal reduces characters to mere caricatures, devoid of the intelligence that defines them in the book. It's worth emphasizing that the protagonists are scientists, not warriors, and the adaptation's failure to honor this has let down both the author and the scientific community at large.Lastly, the director's apparent lack of scientific knowledge and poor grasp of the book's themes has transformed a philosophically and intellectually rich narrative into a simplistic action flick. Whether this was an intentional move to cater to those who struggle with the book's complexity is unclear. Nonetheless, the adaptation falls flat and is, to me, deeply disappointing. In comparison, even Tencent's rendition of 'The Three-Body Problem', despite censorship, remains more faithful and respectful to the source material.",IMDB,Netflix feed you the banana peels instead of the pulp,10.0
"I was actually excited about this show, I don't mind it's been transplanted to the UK and don't mind cultural diversity AT ALL. On the contrary, since they did transplant it to the UK, diversity actually makes sense and it is welcomed.What I do mind was that no scientist does any science in the show or actually looks like someone who does science. They go to parties, take drugs, sleep around and talk about their love lives - don't get me wrong, I come from a relevant milieu myself and do realize that us ""nerds"" also have lives, but this isn't Friends, this is supposed to be a sci-fi apocalyptic story.This whole thing is aggravated by the fact that characters are not well fleshed to begin with - we only get a general idea of the ""type"" of person each one is playing, which leaves small room for actually caring for them, not to mention loving them. Which is further aggravated by all the mediocre to sub-par acting.But then comes Ye Wenjie and the whole China plot. With the exception of the struggle session which is only referred to in the Chinese version, the latter has mysteriously managed to portray Wenjie's suffering during the cultural revolution (due to being the daughter of a disgraced father) in a much more harrowing way. In the Netflix version, there's no ice, no polar temperatures, no isolation, everything looks brighter and she even has an affair, sex included! No starvation, no freezing, no beatings. It almost felt as if it was the Netflix version that went through censorship! Even the person that steals her discovery concerning the aliens is a fellow scientist, and not the Party commissar as should have been. Was the idea not to anger too much the Chinese? Because if it was, they should have watched the Chinese version first.As for Ye Wenjie herself, what I can say. She is such a complicated character and all we see in the Netflix show is anger. And bitterness. Nothing more. I am afraid the scriptwriter never understood Ye Wenjie as a character, and that was the final blow to a show that is mediocre in so many other ways (cgi-still laughing about the way they portrayed the stars flickering, the uninspired ost, the settings ...) but could have been good if they had at least treated its soul, Ye Wenjie, correctly.",IMDB,Meh,5.0
"This is the first sci-fi series that has grabbed me in a long time. Excellent depth of story, great acting and atmosphere. There are layers to the story and the characters aren't one-dimensional.

I get tired of people who have read the books that inspired a series slamming a screen adaptation. They are different mediums.

1- So they were communicating with the aliens for years and made a video game based on cynical and metaphorical phrases and only after 50 years they understood what lying is and decided to think humans are dangerous ?2- They can drive you mad with the countdown but somehow they stopped using this power after episode 3 i think and let their greatest threat (soul) to walk around freely and just send a sniper who eventually fails3- aliens waste their tactical advantage and just go public and insult humans calling them bugs alerting all humans to start to build and fight back?4- they control everything electronic - could have killed soul with airplane system failure and they didntThe story has lots of gab.,IMDB,"Very entertaining, but Doesn't make sense",8.0
"After ""Games of Thrones"" last season and the negative press both Benioff and Weiss got, I didn't think they were going to make a recovery that soon, I was wrong. I had no idea what this show ""3 Body problem"" was about at all. When I saw their names attached to this show it got my interest because regardless of all the hate against them; I still think they are great at developing and producing a show and they have proved it again with ""3 Body Problem"".First, I am surprised as to why this show was not picked up by HBO and why Netflix?. From the first episode it was engaging, even though I didn't much care for the video games parts of it, but the opening scene in Red China of Mao and the story of the character Ye Wenjie is what drew me in. When I looked up the writer of the book "" Cixin Liu"" and discovered there is actually 4 books series, then it made sense why Benioff and Weiss choose to make this into a show and how many seasons it can lead to.I personally rarely get impressed with any show or story anymore because almost everything is been done or derived from other stories, there is hardly anything that is original. I can't say that about this show ""3 Body Problem"", the story is so fantastic and compelling that with each episode it makes you more curious. This fantasy we as humans have with aliens has been explored many many times, but this writer Cixin Liu has an amazing imagination. He has constructed this great science fiction; using real physics and fiction; fused something together that really blows your mind just even thinking about it.You need producers Benioff and Weiss for a show of this magnitude to be developed; I am sure they have learned from their mistakes from Game of Thrones. Please disregard all the negative reviews from haters, when someone says ""great but not amazing"", one has to question what they consider to be amazing, because this story itself is amazing. You don't need to see aliens attack and invasion for it to be amazing. This is something Rod Sterling from Twilight Zone would have called brilliant in writing, it reminded me of one of the Twilight Zone episode called ""To Serve Man"".I think and predict this show ""3 Body problem"" will become a huge success and among the most talked about shows in years to come. I truly congratulate Benioff and Weiss for finding and creating another insightful show!",IMDB,Compelling and brilliant !,9.0
"Liu CIxin's books I really liked because I think very differently about the science of meeting other civilizations and beings. As with any other adaptation especially SF which often is so much in your head and imagination, I was worried. I was pleasantly surprised and think whether or not you read the books, this is an excellent series presenting contact with other worlds in a way most will have never imagined.What I think is great--most of the actors are superb. Da Shi is da bomb--could not be more perfectly cast. Ye Wenjie both young and older were excellent. The Chinese portions of the story are excellent. The imagining of the ""game"" that some are invited to, and some are not was very well done but not used enough--this is the way we learn about the aliens. However the discussions between the Evans character and ""my Lord"" are very well done. The visual effects are stunning, and I think the spirit of the story is captured. One these bases alone the series should get a second season. BT GIVE THE STORY TIME and show the wonder of science please--I felt there was a little rushing around at times and this is a story that needs pondering like the physics problems it proposed in the books.That leads me to what I didnt like. The main writer should have learned the lesson from GoT Season 8 to NOT rush, not assume and not reduce interactions to a quip. I also thing there was enough meat in the first book to do the entire 1st season from first book. I also didnt care much for the Anglicization of the story--Netflix carries series from all over the world, there was no reason to put everyone in England was there?My criticisms aside I just loved that we finally get to see an adaptation and I am so glad most of the actors are serious attemots to mirror someone in the book.

"Over a decade ago, I delved into these Chinese books, which initially commenced with the Cultural Revolution chapter, mirroring the Netflix adaptation's approach. Subsequently, editors opted to rearrange the sequence. The Netflix series adeptly untangles the narrative with precision, remaining faithful to the original tale while ensuring efficiency. Critiques should acknowledge the constraints of budgetary considerations in this lavish TV production. Certain critics focus on casting decisions or the intricacies of romantic entanglements among the characters. However, it's essential to remember that this is a Hollywood-produced television series. Personally, I find the approach of intertwining several main characters across three books and spanning significant age gaps, as seen in the Oxford 5 setting, both intriguing and efficient. It's akin to witnessing masterful chefs transform premium ingredients into culinary art.",IMDB,Fulfillment Feeling As a Long Term Book Fan,10.0
"I haven't read the books, but if they're as Dunning-Kruger as the show, I'm glad I haven't. Wow. It's been a long time since I've seen something pretending to be ""hard sci-fi"" that cares so little about understanding the basics of science. From constantly misusing the word ""theory"", to multiple scientists failing to grasp the foundations of logic and reason, it's almost as if this is Luddite propaganda. The things said would be laughed out of a sixth-grade classroom, let alone academia. A quick example from episode 2:""When science says something is impossible, and that something happens, there's only two options: the science is wrong, or it's a scam"".There are so many problems with that single sentence, that I literally yelled at my screen. First of all, the scientific method doesn't allow you to say something is ""impossible"", as science doesn't make proclamations of truth. It offers tentative explanations for phenomena, based on (in)direct observations. Secondly, ""either the science is wrong or it's a scam"" is such a ludicrously false dichotomy that any scientist saying something like that would be laughed out of any room. No trained scientist would say anything like this, EVER.Besides this, the script is tedious, the story isn't as interesting as it's pretending it is, and the acting... lord, the ACTING. It's so bad. SO bad. Everyone's constantly pretending to be on the verge of tears, the jokes are almost as forced as the accents, and nobody seems to understand their characters.What a waste. What. A. Waste.

"Watching this show was an amazing experience. The only downside? It's just 8 episodes long, and now I've got to wait a whole year for the next season! I honestly didn't expect much at first, but each episode totally proved me wrong, they were all worth it. The attention to detail for each character was spot-on, (expect auggie)and the visuals? Absolutely top-notch. Tianming, Xin, and Thomas became my favorite characters. As someone who read the book, I felt a bit of sympathy for Wenjie, but the way Netflix portrayed her made it hard for me to like anything about her character. The conversations between Evan and San Ti are unforgettable, I've rewatched them like 10 times already but still can't get enough. I really hope Tianming and Xin end up together in future seasons, or I'll cry :3.",IMDB,I love this show like Kanye love kanye,10.0
"I love the trilogy, and was pretty much expecting a negative response from many who have read the books, but in truth I think they have done a great job of bringing the story to the masses.OK, I agree there are negatives. They have missed out a lot and Ye's story does feel very cut short. Also, by removing the mystery aspect of the 1st book, there is no big payoff moment where the reader's mind is blown. However, if they didn't portray the first book at breakneck speed then I would imagine that many would have given up before they got to the payoff.The storylines in the 2nd and 3rd books are (with the exception of CGI) easier to adapt to TV, so I feel as if the hardest part is done. Bringing in the main characters of the trilogy right at the start feels great for the character development too.In summary, this show isn't targeted at me, or the other people who already love the books. This is for those who haven't read the books yet, and as a result I think this series hits the mark very well.",IMDB,Entertaining and good decisions made for adapting to TV,9.0
Been dying for this show the second it was announced. Like pretty much any adaptation I wish there was a couple things they fleshed out a little more mostly revolving around Ye(felt like her story was a little rushed and they missed out on a couple of scenes). Outside of that though love how they made the source material avaliable to a wider audience by the way they adapted the story. Bringing characters from books 2 and 3 earlier on was also a very smart thing to do and will make some payoffs nicer in the later parts of the story. D & D plus Woo still make some pretty memorable conversations as well and feel like they really hit their stride in the last two episodes setting up for some amazing threads if we are lucky enough to see a second season.,IMDB,Please Netflix don't cancel it like u did with 1899!,10.0
"The first two episodes start on really well, with an intriguing concept.Sadly when it comes to story and character development the whole thing feels flat and uninspired. The last five episodes seem to rehash old conversations and topics while not mooving the story forward.Could be because the goal was to force a second season, or simply because of bad writers.Many scenes and dialogues just felt boring and pointless and just had me asking ""What was the point of this scene and dialogue?""Beyond that the story has a few irrational decisions from the characters but I guess you can get behind that given the genre. Interesting concept, but bad or lazy dialogue and character development made it quite boring for me in the end.",IMDB,Interesting concept. Bad dialogue and character development,3.0
"I absolutely loved this show, and loved how it incorporated the philosophical aspects of the books. I think that many of the changes that have been made were necessary in adapting this work. I think more character work at the start of the show could have been a nice to have, allowing us to get to know the characters a bit better before plunging straight in, but I understand why this might not have been done for time and budgetary reasons. All in all, an incredible watch, with very decent acting, some funny lines here and there, and an excellent example of TV science fiction, and what it could and possibly even dare I say, of what it should, look like. As an addtional note, a lot of the criticism of this show seems to be coming from critics that don't like shows with non-constant drama and unique pacing, and while I agree that there could have been ways the show could have done better with its pacing, I think these are silly criticisms of what is overall a very interesting work. Additionally, most of the critics that seem to have read the Trilogy that this series is actually based on, seem to have enjoyed this show so far, or are optimistically holding out further hope for their few criticisms being addressed by subsequent seasons.",IMDB,What a unique approach!

"I did not read the books. So from a purely new perspective, the show is amazing. I was completely invested after the first episode. This sprawling survival tale is based on a Sci-Fi series which has gained worldwide acclaim. The casting and acting is inspired and the effects are special and effective. I binged this over 2 days and already feel empty inside, knowing that I have to wait for the rest. This is a smart, accessible work of science fiction television and deserves to be renewed to completion.Hands down, the best show of 2024 thus far. Had to finish it in 2 seating lol.

"Absolutely loved how they re-wrote the storyline. I read the original book years ago and couldn't stand that the main Character of the first and second books are different. It took me about 2 episodes to make sure who is actually the main character from the first book. Then realized that their English names are somewhat related to the Chinese names from the book.Also loved the visual effect of the game scenes. I couldn't remember from the original book whether there was the two players mode or if other players from other part of the world joined the game as the main character but when I realized that from the show it was really fascinating.For season 2, definitely hoping to see more of a sci-fi show than romantic drama. I agree with the current rating of each episodes. The last couple episodes contain too much of the characters' relationships, and probably that's why their IMDb scores are lowest within S1.",IMDB,Loving the storyline,10.0
"As a huge fan of the book series, I have waited for this to come out for almost a decade.I also had plenty of reservations associated with the Directors of the show (last 2 seasons of GoT) however they blew my expectations out of the water.I think a lot of the criticism I am seeing through other reviews (particularly from other book readers) is unfair and misguided.In the books, many of the characters are written dull and unlikeable. Their actions are loose and separated which would not work for a 8 - 10 episode season. The Tencent version is being put a pedestal despite being way too long to be enjoyed even for a die hard fan like me (30+ hours!). The Tencent book also censors some of the key drivers of the narrative which the Netflix show doesn't.",IMDB,A fantastic start to a Western adaptation,10.0
"I really like the way the books were adapted here. Whilst still following the main beats of the story, there were major changes to the characters from the books. I think these changes were necessary, since besides Luo Ji, Da Shi and Zhang Beinai, the characters of the book really lack any depth, and are just soulless vessels to move forward the plot (especially Wang Miao).The netflix characters feel interesting, and offer a new twist on the story. I mean, why would you want to watch a super close step by step adaptation of the book? Isn't it much better to just read the book in that case?The only downside for me is, that the show can feel a little bit rushed sometimes. They could have taken a little more time to expore certain themes, and a lot of the scientifically interesting parts of the books were cut out.Still im super hyped for season 2!",IMDB,"Big fan of the books, Loving the first season of the adaptation",10.0

This is a remarkable piece of art and I feel like it tugged on a piece of my heart as well. On numerous occasions, I found myself in awe of how these showrunners were able to capture the emotion of the book so perfectly.Yes, we know they made some creative changes in order for this to work but I don't take any issue with this. I watched the Chinese version of this series a couple of years back and I limped to the finish line (30 episodes I believe) because it was so dull, yet also true to the books.

"The overall contents and scenes of the drama were fresh and interesting because they were not seen in existing works.However, their relationship with the characters representing these fresh materials felt clichéd using the clichéd medium of 'love'.Since there are many conceptual concepts that need to be dealt with, I don't think enough effort has been put into convincing viewers of the character relationship.Neither Saul and Auggie nor Jin and Will's relationship was persuasive to easily relate to their feelings.Because of this characteristic of the drama, it is more interesting that the story unfolds in the original book without knowing each other's existence, and makes me want to read the original book more.",IMDB,Creative but clichéd,8.0

D&D are back, and they've proven that when they have excellent source material, they are the GOAT. At first I was skeptical about the location change and reshuffling of the characters, but by the midpoint of the first episode I was fully on board, and now having seen the full season, I am so glad they did what they did because the interpersonal conflict is actually better in the show than in the books.

"There's a good beginning in Mao's China where students scream mantras they don't understand and abuse non-believers for their wrongthink (thank goodness that couldn't happen now).Then we open proper at a Hadron collidor thingy in Oxford (defying physics by clearly being bigger than Oxford) where we meet a scientist, we know he's a scientist because he tells us he is even though he looks like a male model....but then we see his diploma. Case closed. He tells us that the results of their sciencyness simply can't be possible in some way too sciency for us mortals to comprehend (this is shown by a graphic repeating behind him on the screen of two coloured lines going all squiggly around each other).Oh no.Cut to a pub where we meet two lady scientists, we know they're science people because a foolish fellow tries to pick them up and they tell him they are, a) an expert in collidors around the world (oooh this could be useful) and b) an expert in nanofiber technology. Yeah, of course you are, darlin', he says. No, not really, he blinks and runs off to do some karaoke completely believing such nonsense.Completing the line up of a kind of United Colors of Benetton grown up (well, sort of) are the comedy duo; the overweight one (I so want to be Nick Frost) and the dopey in love one (God I wish I was Simon Pegg).Of course, these famous five of sciencyness are all vacuous (OK, Jess Hong tries) millenials. We all know scientists look like Chris Whitty or Anthony Fauci, not Calvin Klein models. But hey, Hollywood. So, I'm still with it ten minutes in.Our Nanofiber tech expert happens to be in an on-off relationship with our scientist with the diploma and the whiggly line graphic, gosh how is this narrative going to play out? She's also begun seeing whiggly yellow numbers in the sky. Oh, I didn't mention that science types who actually look more like science types and not Dior models have been killing themselves (or perhaps murdered...) and left clues; numbers, numbers, numbers investigated by cop/MI6/Agent Mulder guy, ever loveable Benedict Wong looking mysterious.So, our definitely scientist heroine (how does she get time among all that science to do her make up and nails and the TikTok videos, you know she does) meets a woman outside the pub. These two ladies have gone for a cigarette but being millenial actors and seemingly never having seen anyone smoke a cigarette they sort of hold the cigarette to their lips and carefully avoid getting any of the smoke in their respiratory system, blow out imaginary smoke then let the cigarette just burn out (any idea how much these things cost). A side issue, sorry.The non science lady (or perhaps she's a scientist too but has forgotten to bring her diploma) explains the plot to our nanofiber tech heroine and I'm starting at this point to stare at my hand to see how long it takes before it weirdly begins to not feel like it's attached to me because I'm bored senseless.Then it switches to a Mongolian prison camp in 67 and I'm drawn back from my phantom limb gazing for a bit but then it skips back to Oxford and our vacuous five and I'm remembering that experiment where students prefer electric shocks to the boredom of just being alone with their thoughts and I crave being alone with my thoughts so I switch this drivel off and go and stare into the abyss.If you like the Dr Who reboot, BBC3 programming in general, pretty young things pretending to be grown ups, or just have different taste to me then you might like this. Me? I've heard they've just completed shooting the second season of Severance so I'll wait for that to get my sci fi hit.Note: I only watched up this point in episode 1 so maybe the millenial model scientists all kill themselves or are murdered mysteriously and we're left with the great Benedict Wong working out why anyone would want to kill a definitely nanofiber technology scientist and defo squiggly line scientist and things get better but I've got some serious abyss staring to do so...Further note: This was dreadful.",IMDB,(At least) 3 Bloody Problems,1.0
"Easy reviews first, the visuals are mostly bad, special mention to the chimp. The sound design is mostly good. Lighting is pretty standard and Netflixy but works.Not for more in-depth commentary. Actors are alright but mashing all characters into 6 or 7 main ones is pretty weird, when you think about it and the coincidences that occur. The characters they introduced like Tatiana are not well written. Jack Rooney is alright I guess.I liked Will and Jyn, but them being Yun Tianming and Cheng Xin feels rushed. Same with Saul being Luo Ji or Wade being born in the 20th century. I understand the need for introducing us to important characters early, but I dislike how they did this. Things happen so quickly that it becomes boring. Not once are the protagonist struggling with coming up with a solution. For example, Staircase? Dealt with in 5 minutes of screen time.Also, Augustina is one of the worst characters ever created.

"If you've read the original book, you'll know how terribly this adaptation has been done, it's a waste of such a great Three-Body Universe.After watching all eight episodes, the biggest overall feeling is that this drama seems to be quite superficial. The production team neither portrays the brutal reality faced by the Three-Body civilization nor adequately presents the impact of the sophons on human science. Even the part about ""the bugs have never been eradicated"" at the end doesn't resonate much. The fundamental reason is that, in eight episodes (which is roughly equivalent to sixteen episodes in typical Chinese dramas), the story stretches all the way from the twinkling of the universe to the Wallfacers and the Staircase Project, which results in a lack of detailed portrayal of the characters' emotions and struggles with inner turmoil. However, this is precisely the essence of The Three-Body Problem.",IMDB,"Terribly adaptation, ruined such a great Three Body universe.",1.0

"Liu Cixin's trilogy is as grandiose as Author C Clarke's books, the important element of hard core science fiction which expand over thousands years in history, is that it is focused on humantiy as a whole, not on individual or personal life, or private life. And a very important idea is normal people, even though they didn't know or meet each other, come together to the same goal, save humanity from alien invasion. However. And as humans are complicated, it is never about right or wrong, good or evil. However, netflix as its usual limited understanding, put the narrative as black or white, good or evil, binary thinking. And only english speaking people can save the world, a small circle of people who at exford, who know each other, alcohol, drug, f-words, psycholocal trouble, self-doubting, etc. Do people really put the future in these high school drama people's hands, seriously???

"After watching this drama, there is no core, it is simple and crude, lacking scientific literacy and philosophical thinking.The play of respecting the Chinese scene in the original work removed the crucial debate on truth and thought in the original work, and only retained violence and hatred. Ye Wenjie's hatred towards the sun is even more embellished, distorting the original intention and attempting to express the playwright's own position. Ye Wenjie's true enemy is the evil in human nature. Her goal is to transform human civilization through the Three Body Civilization, rather than hating anyone, and she even admires the sun. ""We can only admire the advanced thinking of the highest decision-maker of the Red Bank project.""
The scene of Operation Guzheng is also adding fuel and vinegar, changing the Judgment Day into a kindergarten, in an attempt to portray humans as villains by the playwright. The ETOs are frantically fleeing, seeming to express human cruelty. ""This is an immigration story, and humans are unwilling to accept aliens."" This is the playwright's attitude towards the invaders. And the special effects of this scene are fake, making people think it is an animated work produced by a certain company.The playwright piled up the chaotic scenes and forcibly cut them into a play, making the characters unable to stand up and without any memory points. I thought it was just a change of race and name for the original characters, but I didn't expect it to be a complete change. The roles were randomly assigned, the emotional scenes were mixed up, the comradeship became love, the ambiguity became passion, and I lost that kind of touching emotion, as if it were an undeveloped animal.Reviewed, xx is not working.",IMDB,I suggest we change the name.,2.0
"The original book might be too big for average Americans, who are (quote from Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory) indicment of American education system. The original book tells a story about how all human beings behave when they know about the truth of universe and a all-mighty specis is coming. This adaptation has dumbed it down to popcorn- a small elite circle united to resist. Perhaps it's because Americans can no longer understand something big. To be honest.Therefore, the philosophical connotation of Three-Body Problem is dumbed down to popcorn that American audience can understand: all the characters know each other and are in the same circle. People all over the world only need to obey, and the elites in the small circle unite to save the planet.This is the classic American heroism and the elite view of history that abandon the social fabric. However, compared to the portrayal of these savior elites in the film, the practice of depicting ordinary people as background ants only further exacerbates the narrative flaws of the series. The small circle of elites with the most powerful voice brings suffocating American-style decision-making black box... In this case, it is also assumed that human beings unite to complete part of the wall-facing task. For the opposite reality, this plot is completely meaningless.The final display of the eighth episode shows that the power of all mankind is not as magnificent as Space X live.

"To be honest I only watched one and a half episodes.. that's all I could stomach. How do you take a novel that is rooted in scientific expression and decide removing any hint of actual science is the way to go for the TV adaptation. This series appears to be glossing over everything related to the detailed physics of our universe. It's mentioned enough but not nearly to the point where you understand why any scientist would take their own life when physical laws break down. I understand you have to cater to a larger general audience but there's no reason to think people in general aren't sophisticated enough to take interest. Still, that could have been forgiven if you cast appropriately and or with an ounce of respect for the source material, strike out there as well.

"A Frustrating Symphony of Missed PotentialThe allure of Cixin Liu's ""Three-Body Problem"" trilogy is undeniable. Imagine a world scrambling to prepare for an impending alien invasion, fueled by a chaotic, physics-bending message from a distant civilization. This captivating premise drew me to the Netflix adaptation, ""3 Body Problem,"" with eager anticipation. However, the series ultimately falls short, becoming a frustrating symphony of missed potential plagued by narrative choices that leave the viewer bewildered and irritated.A Story Drowning in Exposition Dumps:The show's greatest flaw lies in its pacing and storytelling structure. Instead of immersing viewers in the escalating tension and paranoia of the impending alien threat, the narrative gets bogged down in lengthy exposition dumps. Characters deliver monologues filled with scientific jargon and historical references, leaving the audience feeling like they're attending a crash course on astrophysics rather than watching a sci-fi drama. These information dumps often feel inorganic, disrupting the emotional flow and hindering character development.Characters Reduced to Mouthpieces for Exposition:Speaking of characters, the show fails to truly flesh them out. They become mere vessels for delivering the dense scientific concepts and historical backdrop. Their motivations, personalities, and emotional journeys remain underdeveloped. We see glimpses of potential in characters like Ye Wenjie, the astrophysicist wrestling with guilt and disillusionment, or Wang Miao, the bewildered nanomaterials researcher thrust into a world of conspiracies. However, these intriguing possibilities are never fully explored, leaving the viewer emotionally detached from their struggles.A Disconnect Between Visuals and Narrative:The show's visual effects are undeniably impressive. The depiction of the Trisolaran fleet, their warped physics, and the devastating societal collapse are visually stunning. However, these impressive visuals often feel disconnected from the narrative. They don't enhance the emotional impact of the story, instead serving as flashy distractions from the show's deeper themes of societal upheaval and humanity's place in the universe.Irritating Narrative ChoicesBeyond the structural issues, a series of baffling creative decisions further hamper the show's potential. The constant shifts between timelines, particularly the jarring jumps to the Cultural Revolution period, feel unnecessary and disrupt the narrative flow. Additionally, the show's reliance on convenient plot devices, such as conveniently timed character encounters or sudden bursts of convenient knowledge, leave a sour taste.A Glimmer of Hope, Lost in Frustration:Despite its shortcomings, the series does have its moments. The exploration of the societal impact of the Trisolaran threat, with its paranoia and fracturing world order, holds promise. There are also glimpses of a more character-driven narrative, particularly in the portrayal of Wang Miao's personal struggles. However, these fleeting moments are ultimately overshadowed by the show's frustrating reliance on exposition and its underdeveloped characters.Conclusion: A Symphony of Missed Notes""3 Body Problem"" is a show brimming with ambition but ultimately fails to deliver on its potential. The narrative drowns in exposition, the characters lack depth, and puzzling creative choices leave the viewer frustrated rather than engaged. While the visuals are impressive and the premise captivating, the show ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to create a truly compelling sci-fi drama. For those seeking a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant exploration of an alien invasion, ""3 Body Problem"" might leave you feeling like you've just sat through a frustrating symphony of missed notes.",IMDB,"Some decent elements, but fundamentally irritating.",3.0

The original idea is a thrilling story with multiple dimensions that could have turned into a generational moment for sci fi fans, to the likes of Game of Thrones for instance. And in fact, the series started off strong, but quickly, as characters came into focus: the show became boring and hard to get committed into. The acting and the cast is simply not up to par to the size of this story. The dialogues are dull, the characters are shallow and the general acting is uncommitted. The director re-write into a western format sounds completely off.

When a physicist seemingly can't count to five while his buddy is performing confirmation before his voyage, who's to blame?This story is apparently based upon a book but I have a feeling that the 'DB Duo' have deviated from the source material once again through judicial use of coke or, even worse, the book this was based upon wasn't worth adapting in the first place and they weren't smart enough to realize it.",IMDB,When stupid people write smart you get 3 body problem,5.0
"As a Chinese book fan, I was very excited about this ""HOLLYWOOD""series. But after watching it, I have to say it's not just disappointing but almost insulting. If you can adapt GAME OF THRONES like that, why on earth would you make 3 BODY PROBLEM like this?? I can understand the simplification, but not to this childish level. The plot even seems like a soap opera, an urban drama. I can take the characters are not all Asian and of course diversed. But they're all simplified into these patterned figures, which I find very annoying. It seems like the team didn't even like the book, they just want to get this done. Somehow it feels like a disesteem to this amazing book. Because not only you show no understanding about the hidden eastern philosophy of the book, but also you show no patience to get the audience to understand the plot and the characters. I'm really frustrated and furious and wish this series was never made.",IMDB,It's almost insulting,1.0
"Do any of you people watch TV? The world building in this show is very poor and a far cry from what I'd expect from these writers. The characters in this show are boring and pointless, you could take out the stoner black guy and the wet paper bag dying guy and the series wouldn't lose anything.What annoys me the most is the sky blinking in the first episode, and the series acts like only the stoner black dude knows how to read morse code in the whole world. If this was actually real, millions of people would share the numbers around rhe world and governments, scientist, and civilians, even religions would be based around these numbers and chaos would ensue. But no, nothing, the whole world just accepts this universe was blinking and life goes on as normal everyone goes to the pub and no impact on life whatsoever, and the best explanation the ""genius"" black stoner guy can give is ""oh it's a deepfake"".

It is hard to know how much time has passed, the ending was not intriguing for another season, and not a single character was remotely likeable.I don't understand the split between the main characters and the push and pull with the plot. It would have been much better focusing on 3 of the group rather than randomly switching all focus between them and giving them predictable dialogue.Ended up having my finger on the 5 second skip button the last episode because I just wanted it to be over.

"You have to admire the people who decided to take on this project -- the original books are not easy to collapse into a tv series, and the producers made a concerted effort to create a smart show. The special effects are excellent; the direction is snappy; the sets are beautiful.However...The not-so-smart decision the producers made was to abandon the books' original characters and instead recreate Friends. Yes, Friends, the basic middle-brow American tv show. Yet somehow the show runners seem to have decided to make all the major young characters part of a group of friends in England, all of them just as whiny and self-involved as in the actual show Friends. There's the beautiful one (aren't all the very smartest physicists in the world fashion models?), the faithful one, the self-involved one, etc etc, and then there's Will, who's a major character because he's dying, and they needed someone to be dying. That's his only characteristic except, of course, that he's in love with another of the Friends so he can whine about it. These people seem to spend most of their time, in the most dire moments in Earth's history, worried about who's sleeping with who, who loves who, and who is smarter.The show is great when it focuses on issues. It's terrible when it's all about the soap opera drama between the world's smartest people (and it would be useful to see, if these young adults are all so smart, an example of their intelligence in their dialog, as instead they all talk like, well, the people on Friends.)A shame this happened.

But it completely falls flat in dialogue and attempting to push characters that are comically too cool for school while being pretty, oh and they are cosmologists and physicists and whatever else at the same time. It's just silly. I would laugh and finally found myself just skipping almost any scene with the Auggie character by the end, because it didn't matter to the plot usually and the actress just was not right for this role and couldn't hold up to it. Terrible casting and writing for her character overall.Eventually I realized you can largely just play the scenes with the Chinese actors and get the actual plot and move the story along and anything else is fluff. Pure fluff that involves people saying ""what's going on?"" Seven times or ""I didn't ask for this!"". I mean the level of selfishness even after these people know an entire alien population is coming to take over the world was truly western. It made me cringe for my culture. Just people whining or talking about nonsense until we cut back to the Chinese characters and finally things move along. I was pulling my friggin hair out by the right episode.

"Unlike some other recent sci-fi, this sets up and delivers the point of departure for the story in a timely manner. ""What's going on"" isn't withheld for multiple episodes, which is appreciated. The main characters are mostly likeable but include a few totally weird casting choices, one of which being a complete screw-up who somehow ends up (apparently) being the most important member of the group of physicist friends involved in saving humanity. Believable? No, not even remotely.Another, probably the most successful physicist in the group in terms of practical applications of advanced physics, looks like a model and would easily rank as the sexiest physicist in history. Distracting? Yeah.Episode 6 can be easily skipped since it features one main character moping around after being diagnosed with fatal cancer. In fact, the episodes leading up to 6 chug along nicely, but then everything changes with 6 and there's a LOT more interpersonal, introspection, pensiveness, and annoying resistance to saving humanity.Imagine, you find out that aliens are coming to squash humanity like bugs, and you can actually do something to possibly save humanity but you're too caught up with ethics of the decisions you have to make to do so.

"Let me start off with one thing. The ""science"" part is absolute nonsense. In each and every aspect throughout the flick. The fiction part is kind of bearable, although there's so much garbage in it, it's laughable at times. Like multidimensional aliens traveling at 1% of speed of light, but instantly sending modded photons to Earth and operating with data, measured in bytes. And as that is not hilarious enough, let's do our currently popular earthling thing and mock up conspiracies, do some virtue signaling, but bring cryonics as plausible scientific method. Well, I'll be damned.Won't even open up on the nixie tube countdown ""effect"", that takes 60% of one's vision as it's ridiculous. Both visually and as a concept. Also ridiculous is the digital noise used to symbolize alien communication. And the cherry on top - the VR thing. Jesus! Who even needed this in the plot in the first place? Consumer VR's been physically around for 30+ years now; the concept for few more decades. Did we just find it's few centuries futuristic?And there's an elephant in the room I need to address. Why was Clarence's son even featured as a character if his only purpose was to tell the viewer something no one cares about. That, he, literally another random halfbrained lazy unemployed brat, is also mohoxesual. Like yeah, okay mate, whatever, doesn't make you any less useless on global scale innit? Probably they should start with your spoiled generation, for all I care.And yet, weirdly enough, it didn't annoy me as much as I expected another lousy book adaptation would do.

I must admit, I had harbored high hopes and expectations upon learning that this endeavor was backed by the esteemed HBO network.

"I got hooked on the official Chinese program last year and after several episodes it stalled out and I started skipped ahead, which only made it worse. I think there was 4-5 episodes of the video game and I just couldn't be bothered. Then it got so out of hand I gave up and didn't finish.This American version looked promising from the previews, until I found out that the D&D guys that butchered the Game of Thrones series are behind this. The guys who just winged the last season of a great story, zero thinking and created the worst final season in the history of television. So yeah, there is going to be parts that absolutely make no sense so I'm prepared.I finished it and it's a decent watch. As other reviews have pointed out the casting is poor, female strong leads and bumbling men are standard as per 2020 Netflix. The dialogue is sub par with lots of buzz words. Lots of drama like a Friends episode. A few plot holes that just don't make sense which is expected with D&D running the show.It could have been really good, but these two guys just don't have the skills to make something anything better than average. I'm sure that they are wealthy enough from GoT, but they'll never get any awards.When you have an entire book series as a baseline, plus a popular Chinese television version of it for 30+ episodes it seems like you should be able to just pick out the good parts, summarize and edit. All of the heavy lifting, writing and creating is already done.I'm confident that D&D couldn't even remake Bambi to make it interesting and watchable. 5/10.

"I've not read the books, just watched the original Chinese show.It's impossible to turn a series of books into a 30 episode TV series without leaving a lot of the body and spirit by the wayside.The Chinese series is hardly perfect - plot holes, ridiculous characters (mostly ""foreigners""), vague explanations, lucky ""coincidences"", and more. But it does provide the viewer one thing at least - time. Time to get to know the main characters, their history and culture, time to think, time to form ideas and criticism, time to breathe.When the american production decided to ""slim it down"" to 8 (eight!!) episodes, it took away that time.What remained is reminiscent of the dessicated bodies of the Trisolarans, when chaotic times hit them.The americans try to re-hydrate the dry storyline with the only tactics they know - comic-relief characters, love interests, lively banter, commercialization, gratuitous violence. Some say they have ""dumbed it down"" for the american audience, but I believe they are just robbing those who are open to explore different types of storytelling than the ones they are force-fed every day.I enjoyed the Chinese series, despite its shortcomings.

"After you finish watching this series, do you believe it ranks among the best or top three sci-fi series you've ever seen? If yes, then the series is deemed satisfactory. However, if you're unsure or feel it doesn't meet that standard, then it falls short.Why do I ask this question? Because the novel ""The Three-Body Problem"" is universally acknowledged as a masterpiece, even considered one of the greatest contemporary science fiction works worldwide. It's astonishing that such a celebrated novel has been adapted into a mundane romantic sci-fi series. Without having read the novel, you might find the series passable. But you need to understand a fact: the original novel's brilliance surpasses this series by a hundredfold.As to whether fidelity to the source material is crucial, I don't believe it is. If the screenwriter has better creative ideas, adaptations can be made. However, it's evident that the screenwriter likely didn't thoroughly read the original novel, as many brilliant parts have been omitted and replaced with irrelevant content. This is alarming and has led to numerous factual errors and distortions of the novel's core story.If the content of the original novel and this series were the same, it definitely wouldn't stand a chance at winning the Hugo Award.These are my feelings after carefully watching the entire series.

I'm still shocked at how mediocre it is bc even the wonder boys used their names to tout it and it in advertisements and I was excited but once I new few more details I knew it would just NOT BE.

"I'm only watching 3BP for the storyline and the CGI.The acting is absolutely dreadful and I don't blame the actors - I blame the producers who didn't allow the actors to bring their characters to life.It's a new Netflix tactic to prop up the number of hours watched (a KPI which is reported to the markets).The recipe: dumb down acting creativity and flare, maintain a linear, bland storyline backed by CGI and, sadly audiences will binge watch. I'm not saying that binge watching is bad nor am I suggesting audiences are dumb either - but we're more than capable of appreciating deeper storylines and connecting with characters on an emotional level.Don't believe me? Watch Netflix's 1899. It had an awesome, mind-bending, sci-fi storyline backed by incredible CGI and most importantly, method actors who were given creative freedom to immerse themselves in their roles.But Netflix deemed it too complicated for audiences to follow - and less likely to binge watch. The result... cancelled after one season.Who remembers Netflix's Dark? Filmed entirely in german, it took us through three gripping, tense and deeply paradoxical seasons which stretched our imaginations and left us itching to learn more about Jonas Kahnwald and Martha Nielsen's universe-destroying love story.

"A mildly entertaining story, very loosely based on the book.Choice of limey old England was unfortunate as its a downer for many viewers, doesn't make much sense given UK's current irrelevance, and significantly deviates from the original story. I understand most of the intended audience has a low tolerance to reading subtitles, and having a Chinese cast speak English would have maligned our perpetually maligned auntie, but why go for UK? There's more interesting & relevant Anglophone countries to base it in... even SG would've made more sense.Despite the setting & goofs, the story is still engaging up to around mid-season, by then the mystery is revealed and it becomes a bit of a slog. Acting was occasionally funny, but the characters 1D, tiresome after a while. Actors felt like actors pretending to be scientists without having lived in the role 1st. Relationships between characters also felt forced & unnatural, with only a couple of exceptions.Goofs include the unfolding proton thing, which is essentially magic, and like most magic in stories it suffers from the writer's lack of imagination on how it would be used, and inconsistencies in its stated logic, for example how it reflects a skylit ground after blocking the sky... and if it could reflect/block light at that scale, why not use it to attenuate sunlight back home? Regardless, if these protons could alter vision and computer storage, they could swiftly end the careers of anyone much more effectively & secretly than spooking them with a countdown. Magic + lack of imagination never works, stick with hard sci-fi instead.The show has many references to superstition, including modern ones brought to us via scholarly grift: ""what if columns of my spreadsheet were alternate realities?"" or: ""I can digest your lunch while digesting mine if we entangle them""... I'm surprised they didn't chuck in the ""we're all noodles"" thing, though they did mention how colliders produced 'wrong' results, which are then blamed on a deity - a viciously funny in-joke, but I doubt it was intentional. Other goofs generally reveal the age of the show's creators, like sitting in a car using an SLR camera to surveil someone, or the constant smoking.Vfx was poorly directed: milky lighting, white sky + sunlight, over-comped, weird camera & timing that screamed ""now here's a vfx shot"". The comical slicing scene was especially disappointing given how eerie it could have looked.Don't remember the Music.",IMDB,pub carpet,4.0
"I did not read the SF novel(s) on which this series is based, which however shouldn't be a requisite, therefore my review is only about the show.The first episodes have the annoying non-linear structure so fashionable nowadays and used for every new show. The audience is thrown in the middle of a story and a series of flashbacks tells how it started. Chronologically, the plot begins in China in 1966, during the Cultural Revolution and the main character is a young female scientist, Ye Wenji sent to a remote part of the country to pay for her cultural sins. Good start and good acting.Given her experience, the Ye character develops an understandable hatred for the human race at large, and thanks to her contact with billionaire Mike Evans, the two develop an ""assistance plan"" for an alien invasion. The clever twist of the plot is that it will take the aliens some 400 years to reach Planet Earth. Will the humans discover the plan and be able to do something to prevent it? So far, so brilliant and not a spoiler, since the alien part is revealed fairly soon in the series. What was worth 10 stars drops miserably with the development in present-day England (is that England?) where mostly non-English people and girl bosses take over.Two mysterious investigators (Wade and Clarence) contact a group of ""5 brilliant young scientists"" to work with them. While Benedict Wong is quite good as the sour and unintentionally funny ""investigator"" Clarence and probably my favorite character, the ""Scientists 5"" are miscast, the elephant in the room being Eiza Gonzáles as a ""nanoscientist"" ... or whatever.One would think she is too busy putting on makeup, going to the hairdresser, and pouting to be able to do any nanoscience, and her ""crime"" is compounded by the other young females (Tatiana, the Sophon, and Jin Cheng). These girl bosses take over the show with their arrogant, snotty attitudes, while the male characters are mostly disposable wimps. The plot dilutes into love stories, power struggles, and attitude displays while the aliens sail along in their spaceship.",IMDB,Nano-what?,5.0
"Absolutely not.It is not only made unbearable adapt,as an original drama it was notlogical and scientific at all. If the sparkling of universe can be seen by eyes without any auxiliary means,how the world still in peace?

Seems that the temperature decline would be too quick.By the way,the actors and actresses also brought bad performances. Their actions were lifeless,and what they said were just like reading the script after the shoot,without any emotion in it.I have no idea where Netflix use the money. When the nanometer materials passed through the ship,it seemed like the ship was made by papers,have no texture.

"The most underwhelming show I've seen in a long time. The beginning and first 5 episodes were great. It got me hooked pretty quickly and I binged through the whole show in two evenings. But with The Judgment Day episode it all went from a great 10/10 show to melodrama with bad writing and the plot turned in a completely different direction than was necessary.Sending a brain, our most valuable part to an alien species was apparently a great idea. And the execution? I wasn't surprised it failed. I was even glad it did.No NASA involvement, no actual scientists in the game. How did they expect Will to outsmart the aliens and somehow gather an intel for humans to later use as an advantage? Not even speaking about the fact that the sophons somehow were being used against humanity but at the same time just weren't. Why didn't they crash the plane Saul used later on? If they (the sophons) have the ability to control autonomous cars, why didn't they just turn off all power plants right away?I just hope this show gets scrapped and never picks up for another season.

"Scientists all over the globe are mysteriously killing themselves. A vast sonar dish is used to send a message into space... and a reply comes back.

A guy is terminally sick; his friends are sad. Some people are sitting on the beach. Everyone is smoking cigarettes. That guy is still sick. Oh, the girls are stressed out and anxious and mostly angry. And they're popping anti-anxiety meds. Everyone is depressed. The women are very, very angry and upset, all the time. People are pouting. They're whispering, because they're depressed. This is what the show is about.Of particular disappointment is the writing of ""some of the smartest people on the planet"". There is not one conversation had by these people which seems like the kind of conversation super smart people would have. ""Aliens will destroy us"", says an adult. ""Let's just smoke some Js"" is the literal reply of someone we are supposed to believe is extremely smart. These allegedly smart people flash fancy diagrams they've allegedly created. But they don't utter a single sentence indicative of intelligence. They don't like to talk about anything interesting. They have a lot of mental health issues. Is it highly intelligent to allow yourself to persist in a low state?

So what would humans do now?However, the rest is lacking on all levels. The dialogs are childish, the characters are dry - there's no connection with anyone, the story is rushed, the end... well, I won't say anything about the end in case you still want to see it.The only think this series excels at is diversity. Netflix outdone itself in this area. But seriously, are viewers in 2024 so naive to fall for a character that is a world-renown specialist in particle accelerators, can read the entire CERN software code in a couple of days, finds engineering solutions to space travel and many others.

I don't even know if there's a second season...if there's more seasons then this is just ok. Still incredibly unsatisfying. If there's no more seasons, then wtf even was this?

Readers of the books that feel the tension build until they find out what's actually going on will be disappointed that it's just casually introduced in episode 3 during a mundane conversation. The use of comedy and swearing feels incredibly out of place. Worst of all is how it sweeps aside most of the Chinese cultural aspects of the story, something Americans desperately need to be more familiar with, for no reason other than perhaps to accommodate the US political agenda that's trying to manufacture an enemy to get voters riled up against. If I was to summarize how I felt watching season 1 it's 1 word:bored.",IMDB,"Boring show, and a terrible adaptation, just OK to have on in the background",4.0

Complaining that auggie is too good looking to be a top scientist is borderline sexist and plain stupid. Even if they are far feom the majority you meet many young women in science university studies and they can be stunning or ugly just like in any other curriculum. Choosing a part western cast for an international oriented big budget TV show makes perfect sense, recently there not a single production without an Asian and an Indian to please local audiences for the same reasons...

The industry is grappling with how to balance cultural authenticity with the demands of global audiences and the principles of inclusivity and diversity.

"Golly. I had high hopes for this one based on a few reviews I read. But geez, nothing could have prepared me for my disappointment.Apart from exploring some slightly intriguing sciency/fictiony ideas, the dialogue is only marginally better than a B-Grade soap opera, and no amount of acting chops could improve that. Sadly, there wasn't anyone capable of delivering a performance to even try to raise the standard.Some giant leaps in plot development, leaving too many questions unanswered is also a bit of a problem.Honestly, 5/10 is probably a bit generous, but I felt sorry for the crew and caterers.",IMDB,"Poorly scripted, terribly acted",5.0
"The series starts with a impactful scene from the Chinese cultural revolution where people are murdered for believing in science and the truth, and not complying with their social revolution.Almost unbelievably, Netflix then switches to a scene where they show how they, themselves, are perpetrating the modern version of this.Within the first couple of minutes you'll meet the genius leading black character working overtime and the two genius female leads, one Asian and one gorgeous white woman. All the classics. Then add the white male doofus trying to talk to them but who is of course rejected, looked down upon and is just pathetic. This story unfortunately just continues.A society based not on the truth, not on the scientific method, but their misled, brainwashed beliefs, is a society that is destined to implode.

It completely missed the existential dread and cosmic horror of the books. Nevermind changing races and locations of characters, mixing characters from different generations?!

From the scientific base of books built There is a good point of view, however when you combined all the science with the development of characters and fiction of scriptwriter. Its starting to lose meaning. Development of characters in the books might be much more detailed or the same comment is valid for the fictional development of the story.

It starts off intriguing but after episode 4 it feels so ridiculous that it becomes borderline unwatchable.It's not the aliens or the ""science"" that are hard to suspend disbelief for so much as the casting, acting and script. It's so melodramatic and hammy. However, Jess Hong deserves a medal for single handedly holding the whole thing together, despite the fact that she is working with garbage. I hope she gets an amazing role off the back of this.I've not read the source material but it very much feels like they are attempting to pack in too many events at the expense of elements like character development.Also the whole business about the San-Ti not being able to lie or understand lying seems like massive plot hole since at that point they have done very well at leveraging uneven information sharing.",IMDB,Really goes down hill mid way through,4.0

I was literally cringing during some scenes.It truly baffles me how there are so many good reviews. I can't be the only person who sees how lacking in quality this show is. Because it's not just the acting. Some scenes are too long (like a panning shot that should have been half the screen time). A lot of scenes contain (unintentional) uncomfortable pauses between characters that could have been helped by a decent score, but nope. Not this show.I'll stick with the books on this one.",IMDB,"Great premise, terrible acting",2.0
"What's all the hype about, you ask? Why are all the nerds giggling like a 5 year old? Well that's because th 3 body series is one of the greatest pieces of science fiction literature in recent history. The books are deeply imaginative, philosophical and ponder some very interesting questions relating to the universe and extra terrestrial life.Now, If you haven't read the book(s) then it's a totally different thing and the show isn't half as bad and it's something you'll watch once and enjoy and that's about it.Understandably, they've changed the setting and added some bits to make it work as a TV adaptation but it has more than a few pitfalls:1. The motley crew of main characters feel generic and there's too much drama thrown in with little time spent on developing them.2. The above said actors have done a very sub par job and you don't feel any connection to them.3. There is this sense of existential dread and fear of the unknown you get when you read the book. By adding needless (and poorly done) humour it breaks whatever little tension that has built up.But to be fair they've done a great job with how they've shown the backstory of Ye Wenjie, all that's been done beautifully.It's not an easy book to adapt to TV by any measure but trying to cater to a wide general population has turned this into a tasteless mish mash that doesn't satisfy anyone.",IMDB,They turned it into a generic sci-fi show,4.0
"I have not read the books but I have heard for years about this great series. I was cautiously optimistic when I heard about Benioff & Weiss doing the adaptation for Netflix because they would have a completed work to adapt. They did a wonderful job on GOT until they ran out of Martin's source material. If these books were as good as they are said to be, there must have been a lot changed or lost in bringing it to Netflix.The first episode really drew me in. The scenes in China were great and a wonderful setup. I was anxious to see more. Then we meet the main characters (I agree with another reviewer's description of them as UK version of Friends). They do not in any way seem to act like scientists. But then this ""science fiction"" story seems to try and eliminate any vestige of real science. We are told that the world's super colliders are producing impossible results and that science is broken, but we are given not the slightest clue as to what those results might be. I guess we, the audience, are too stupid to understand. The list of unexplained illogic goes on. Why is Evans reading fairy tales to the aliens? Why is the nano fence a better way of destroying the ship than a bomb ? Why do the all powerful aliens need to recruit a cult on earth? And above all, we are really shooting a brain into space to meet and hopefully infiltrate the aliens? When this was brought up my first thought was that sixties classic ""They Saved Hitler's Brain"".There is more to telling a story than filming a series of scenes!

"Full of lazy, clichéd characters with poor dialogue. Like others have said, it attempts to represent all groups but does so with a group of people who know each other from Oxford. Had they been more international with it, it could have added depth.It also does a poor job of representing stronger female characters as other people mention.It's got a very ""BBC"" vibe in it's photography style too. If you can handle the Doctor Who Sci-Fi style then it won't bother you but I was hoping for something more detailed and visually spectacular - especially given the pedigree of the people involved.There are also far, far too many cameos from British celebrities of varying levels of fame. With better dialogue though Ade Edmondson would have been great.I haven't read the source material but it must be super interesting because the concepts are great. It twists and turns and teases with dilemma and wonder and in more nuanced hands with more patience for the story could have really flown.Perhaps in time, someone with more craft and nuance will do it some justice but at present it's nothing more than a mindless watch but could be a classic if you're 12 years old and don't really care about the stupidity of some aspects.I always look back at Flight of the Navigator as a classic but it is in truth, riddled with cliché itself.

"This series fails on two levels. First, it fails to live up to the novel on which it is based. Then, it fails simply on its own. The treatment of the characters is so shallow that it affects our ability to understand their actions or to find them sympathetic. The story is told in a choppy, highly compressed way with lots of cuts that create needless confusion. (If you are going to waste 8 hours on this, you should probably watch a few episodes at a time so the flashbacks and jumps make sense.) The original characters are changed to fit modern DEI requirements and the casting is so ridiculous it must have been done by the beta version of Google Gemini. Yes, sure, quantum physicists can pout and gaze vacantly and wear a lot of lip gloss, but this group of five are highly implausible as five Oxford physics geniuses. Tik Tok influencers? Sure. Reality show stars? Absolutely. But not five great scientists.I have never seen the Chinese TV version. Perhaps someday there will be a new attempt at a Western version.

She's just a pretty face and nothing more, she's completely unconvincing as a serious and highly intelligent scientist (she's just really bad at acting because she doesn't know how to act the right emotions). This is not helped by the uneven screenplay, which oscillates between interesting, already seen and stupid. A lot of theses are forced and stretched, and the scene with stopping the Doomsday ship with nano-fibers is completely unnecessary and illogical (it was possible to get hold of the data disk in a hundred other ways). All over the planet, people went wild and started killing each other because aliens will come in 400 years?! And smart scientists believe that aliens are not capable of lying and deceiving? WTF?

The first part of the series really sets you up for something great, but the finale is one of the worst finales I have seen since Ragnarok.The acting was pretty good except for the actress who played ""Auggie"". I found her performance to be canned and flat at best. The other actors covered for her most of the time so it's not too much of an issue.I guess if I could sum up anything is that this is not a Science Fiction TV show. It's more a romantic drama which, towards the end, really pours on the schmaltz and sentiment.The whole ""Wallfacers"" thing is completely incomprehensible and not flushed out at all.

Is there a deleted episode somewhere???3- obvious question but why Saul? I have an explanation on the same idiotic level as this show.. maybe because he is the BFF of the guy going into space so the aliens somehow think they can hold his concaciousness hostage once they recieve his brain or something dumb like that.4- I'm gonna buy a 18mil £ star for my lady... but its just a piece of paper.. nope.. this act shows how stupid the character is and makes you not empathesise with him any longer.5- ill update it when i remember.. im still having PTSD from wasting my timeI really wanted to like this show.

"There is no respect for books or Chinese culture. It's just the arrogance that the West has always had towards the Asian world.

Why are there children on Judgment Day? Is this the only culture you have in the West? ""Operation Guzheng"" was a secret, quiet and serious operation, not a farce that alarmed everyone. Why is ""Cosmic Flicker"" a terrible special effect with a twinkle of a star? Don't you have common sense? The ""cosmic flicker"" is not a real twinkle of stars, but a change in cosmic radio waves.

Another character has hang-ups about decisions that kill other human beings but nobody cares because it's a war and that's just what happens.

"The only reason I didn't give this a one star is because the early episodes captivated my imagination. The premise really had me thinking about the show after watching. I did not read the books, but I have to believe the original author did a more effective job integrating plausible science to storytelling. Science Fiction can be entertaining, even if the audience is called upon to suspend disbelief. But it can't be stupid. And this scripted adaptation is so full of stupid. I'm not even going to comment. I actually feel more stupid having completed the full season.The first 3 to 4 episodes were intriguing and the Chinese revolution backstory is very well done. I had such high hopes!The famous shownrunners cast several GOT actors, but all with limited episode arcs. It makes good sense from a business standpoint, as the GOT actors help hook the audience. But one can't help feel cynical that after they're all gone, we're left with a bunch of mediocre actors to carry the series forward. The Augie character is spectacularly awful. I went to Oxford and Cambridge and am a STEM PhD. I never saw a scientist that had Kardashian lips! Actually, that was entertaining because I started LOL every time she had a scene.Almost nothing makes sense after episode five. The story gets bogged down in Z-gen relational subplots. One gets the sense that Netflix management assigned the DEI officer in HR to be the casting director. I can't imagine a successful book wasting pages on that stuff. Really cringe.I was curious enough to see how far off the rails the Showrunners would take the story, so I finished the first season.

"A commendable adaptation that manages to create a more atmospheric unfolding of the initial stages of the story than the Chinese version.The production is quite something, the visuals are dazzling, acting is solid... however, one can only call this intellectual & original sci-fi if one has never come across Stanislaw Lem, Ph. K. Dick, R. Silverberg, R. Bradbury etc.Rehashing age-old sci-fi ideas in a postmodern mix that can be entertaining, intriguing, and visually pleasing at the same time is not exactly 'intellectual' and certainly not original.There is a very sharp delimitation point in the series, around episode 5 - when the entire promising thing turns into absurd banality packed full of cliches.Spoiler alert... The pivotal moment of the aliens discovering what lies are and that humans can lie comes after decades of conversations and the deployment of a mind-probing virtual reality game that allows them to select a number of key people. And yet... this civilisation after such a long and deep interaction with the human mind does not realise that we lie... until... one person tells them in an audio conversation.From that moment onward, the tropes of ""we shall build a Moon base"" in, metaphorically speaking, minutes with current technology, the scheme of accelerating a payload with a human in it in a way that (to put it very, very mildly) would not be survived by a human body, and so on and so on become simply painful to watch.It is one thing to have a plot hole of the size of the Mariana Trench in the centre of the entire story, but it is another thing to violate basic science whilst claiming to be operating with the outer reaches of highly evolved science.Unfortunately, it is yet another series that not only doesn't adhere to very old sci-fi ideas that it regurgitates in a tarted-up form, but it cannot adhere even to the laws of elementary logic.And then we wonder why some who have not had previous contact with science fiction end up considering the entire genre as some brainless fantasy with no value.",IMDB,Rehashing age-old sci-fi ideas... with vast plot holes,4.0
"I watched the series because it was recommended to me by a friend. I'm have a bit of a scientific / technical background, and I must say I was shocked at how bad the story was. From the scientific and technical point of view, most ideas in the story were so poorly thought through that it was simply painfull to watch. However even neglecting that, there are also many points in the story that don't make sense. I don't know if the book was better and this is just a poor adaptation beefed up with random indeas, but I can only say that the whole story is so bad. In any case, the series does not merit the title science fiction. It is just a fanatsy series.",IMDB,Bad fantasy story,4.0
"This is my first review on IMDB.I recently read the book and found it enormously difficult to finish. There are dozens of characters. They all (with the exception of Ye Wenjie) seemed like human icebergs, no soul, no layers. The pace of the book is chaotic, full of science that honestly bored me. I'm a fan of Asimov, Sagan, Kaku, Stephen Hawking ... but the way Cixin Liu delivers the science seemed pompous and worthy of a draft. Let's see, Asimov, one of the most brilliant minds of humanity, when he wrote fiction, he cared about plot, about logic, about characters, and he didn't need to throw all his science wisdom at us; he did that in his non-fiction books.Also, for a book that claims to be extremely scientific, it feels outdated and incongruous. I thought the Netflix series would improve these aspects, that it would at least heat up such a cold book, and they partly did, but the story of the book is what it is. And on top of that, they added aspects that also make little sense (even from the other two books) yet simply make the plot holes become black holes.True, some characters in the series are somewhat Soap Opera-like, etc. But there are bigger problems: the main plot. The biggest problem with the series is the story as such, and this is because of the book.1.- If Ye Wenjie receives a warning signal from a race that is theoretically incapable of lying, warning her at least five times not to respond, then why is there any hope for the Lord? The signal is warning her that they are going to invade them, and Ye thinks it's salvation? No, Ye thinks it's punishment and that humans deserve to be annihilated. But neither in the book, nor in the Netflix series do they develop this dilemma well. Sometimes, you think Ye made the choice for the sake of humanity in the long run, sometimes simply for retribution. It could be both options, but it doesn't make much sense. Why is Ye astonished when the San-ti call humans ""bugs"" if they warned her from the beginning that they would go after them?2.- How is it possible that scientists commit suicide just because their data doesn't add up? That doesn't befit a scientist. Science faces challenges all the time. Just now, the Webb is causing a stir in the scientific community, and that is exciting, not depressing. In the series and in the book, the scientists act more like mystics who have lost faith, rather than scientists who want to dig deeper and deeper. In the real world, they may feel frustrated, defeated, for a moment, but mass suicide? Nope. If it is because the San-ti are manipulating their minds directly, then all is lost, because the San-ti can do the same to the prominent leaders of humanity, etc. If it is simply because of the failure of science at certain points, suicide by scientists is unrealistic and absurd.If you need to remove a hard disk from a ship, how is it possible that the best solution is to use nanofibers and to kill everybody? After all, nanofibers are only very powerful and very small blades. The odds of the nanofiber also destroying the hard drive are almost 100 percent. Besides, there were children on that ship. On the other hand, wasn't it better to perform a surgical operation and catch Mike Evans ( ghastly underdeveloped) and seize the technology that was on the ship, the hard drive, etc.? That whole scene makes no sense; it's there just for the Wow effect. Also, for a scientist to lend herself to this, after so much struggle, is a terrible decision for the character.4.- The Sophon is the end of the game. The San-ti can know everything humans do and manipulate what they see. They can make the stars twinkle, place an eye in the sky, make the sky look like a mirror. So isn't it obvious that they can make humanity destroy itself in a few years? It is extremely simple for them. The options are endless. They can collapse power plants, water plants. They can alter atomic bombs (more or less a la Skynet in Terminator)... Besides, if the sophon watches over humans, how come the San-ti didn't know that humans lie? And with the sophon, it's impossible for humans to strategize, since the sophon will always know everything.5.- For the convenience of the script and the book, the sophon cannot read minds. But then again, it doesn't need to. Well, after such a plot hole, humans publicly say they are going to create the walfacer project. Another project that makes no sense. This is from the second book. Dark Forest. SPOILERS FROM, BOOK TWO START HERE!!!!Let's see, that book was written in 2008, before Kepler and Webb. Now we know there are thousands of planets (only in the Milky Way) and many of them could be like Earth. The Dark Forest theory to explain the Fermi paradox is quite poor. I don't mean that it is pessimistic, but rather lame. According to this theory, if someone in space with more technology than us discovers us, we are more or less doomed. But I don't think that's true, since a civilization capable of mastering dimensions (as demonstrated in the third book) should also be able to see and detect us, and yet we're still here. They would only attack if they felt threatened by us, but we are completely harmless to space. The San-ti are right: we are bugs. So what is the stress of killing whatever you see in a dark forest if you are more powerful. That is justifiable for unintelligent predators. It is as if an Orca sailed in the dark sea, and upon seeing a small fish, killed it out of fear, not hunger. The Orca is above such an instinctive survival decision. Besides, the universe is not a dark forest for civilizations that have been able to develop some technology. Even we have ways of seeing the cosmos. Anyway, this theory, and the way they apply it in the book to make a pact with the San-ti (I repeat, a pact when the San-ti have the sophon, which is practically God) is quite absurd. It is to think that the universe is reduced to a jungle full of snakes whose only objective is to survive and not to be killed. It is extremely simplistic.END OF SPOILERS FROM BOOK TWO!!!!!6.- The whole plot of bringing a human brain to space and giving it to the San-ti (this is from the third book) doesn't make any sense either. What can humanity win by doing this? Besides, the San-ti have been studying us for decades with the sophon. I insist, the sophon slays any plot that may come after it, turning them into far-fetched and far-fetched decisions and scenes. Could they be mind-blowings? Uh, if they make any sense, yes. Otherwise, they're just imaginative scenes (science-based mostly) just to be contrived for the sake of being gimmicky.",IMDB,"After the Sophon, it's game over!",3.0

"I am a physicist thus firstly I have to admit the GOT duo's legend has been seriously tainted by this production. To begin with, the casting leaves much to be desired. Physicists are a solemn lot, cerebral, isolationist and not totally sociable. These actors do not come across as authentic scientists, thus making the story less engaging. Also no scientist I have ever met curses incessantly!The reason 3 body was such a success is because it gave a sci fi narrative to complex scientific hypothesis. The books touch upon our concepts of God and divinity. They furthermore delve into the mathematical precepts of the actual 3 body problem. This version is candy coated to absurdity with actors walking through the parts. Did the duo just miss the forest or did Netflix force them to miss the forest.

"So far, there is no any adaptation exceed the book. The parts of Luoji'class, put the the Quantum to deep space and many other adaptation in animation exceed the book. The part of LuoJi throw tools and tools divide to multiple is so interesting.The reason why it is said to be a long trailer is the same as I thought before, which is caused by pulling the preparation stories of the last two books forward, so that the audience can only watch the head.Each episode is multi-line, such as the eighth episode with walls and stairs. This is different from what was expected at first. I think the single line is clearer.The part of looking at the bug. It's not very burning. The first half of Tencent's version dragged on, drinking crazy, and the second half became more and more burning, and the score was very good.The opening song is very short. I criticized Tencent's opening song for imitating the West before, but I didn't expect Netflix's own song to be unconventional now.The cruelty of the guzheng plan is well reflected. Tencent version is somewhat weak. In this scene, the people on the boat are fleeing, making the protagonists look like villains. I like this kind of values very much.Ye Wenjie, a staunch believer, was counterespionated by Wade with the recording of Evans and the Lord? The taste of 2DB is too low. They adapted it to a worse version. It must be better that Ye Wenjie, who loves human beings spontaneously. This will more complex and three-dimensional. Of course, Ye Wenjie actually changed because of Qijiatun. But it's better than this.The part of you're bugs is okay. Tencent version is more confusing.2DB is really incompetent. Ye Wenjie and Cheng Jin said this? The same counterespionage as Wade? Ye Wenjie has become a big fool! She even need be teached by Cheng jin, a younger generation? Ye Wenjie's position should run through all three books, and she is a great mentor and wise woman. Hmm. This is not as good as the animation. The part of Ye Wenjie was put on trial in the animation, although she played a villain, at least showed wisdom. Ye Wenjie's plot compiled by 2DB actually seems pedantic.Three factions were reduced to one arrival faction. 2DB brain capacity are really small, so they can't understand original ideal of Ye and the ideal of three factions.Ye's smile was so enchanting and evil when she shows up. What a villain.The part of let's not resist quite elegant. But this is because of faith in the Lord. . Kind of like a dynamic cartoon version. However, the characterization of ye Wenjie in dynamic cartoon version also takes a variety of routes, and only Pan Han is the bad guy.Why does 2DB think its adaptation will be better than the original plot? So far, many adaptations are inferior to the original.Why let Yang take the credit? 2DB can't tolerate there are any good people in China? This is the plot of copying Bai Betrayal Ye in an inferior way.Think of it, if there is no original comparison, the impression of the pure villain Ye is still ok. Unfortunately, there is comparison, 2DB still went to a bad way.When I watch the last episode of 7. Finally, it's time for cosmosociology. As a result, the dialogues are very strange. Is it a new clue to defeat the three-body different from book2? Watch season2. In a word, this part is quite satisfactory, the artistic conception of an old and a young talking about wisdom has been made out. But at first Ye said, I know you don't want to see me. Hey, what characterization? This is. Big villain ye.Will did a good job of following Saul's advice according to the numbers. In the book is filled with inner descriptions.In addition, Ye talks wisdom with saul was not arranged in the first episode or the last episode, which was not very good and was not grand enough. Of course, this characterization of Ye Wenjie itself is not grand. Maybe some reporters wrote a film review saying that the character is flat refers to Ye.It's really great to visit Red Coast Base again without deleting it by 2DB. Actually, Ye of this kind characterization doesn't have to visit Red Coast Base again. And It's also best to visit Red Coast Base again in the last episode.Ye Wenjie was silenced? 2DB can't give an ending of die a natural death. Hey. The scene where the woman talks to Ye looks disgusting. Trying to kill me and pretending.I originally said that Tencent version has shortcomings, I hope this version can surpass it. Who knows it's not as good as that. It is said that 2DB can't adapt well without original books. I don't think it will good if there is. Why not follow the book and change it into a plot with poor effect? It is a good thing to speed up the story. But I didn't ask you to change the plot, and it got worse.Moreover, we already know the plot of the story, so it's no fun to watch the same story again. The animation adds a main line, the four episodes of the Sky-ladder, except for the love drama, the science fiction part is quite good.I watched it at twice the speed. Except for all the Ye parts.

"Plot Deviation:
Rather than immersing audiences in the intricate world of interstellar conflict and mind-bending scientific concepts, the Netflix adaptation chooses to prioritize mundane drama over the essence of the source material. Instead of delving into the complexities of humanity's encounter with an advanced alien civilization, viewers are subjected to an excessive focus on characters' emotions, thoughts, and interpersonal relationships.Minimal Sci-Fi Content:
The most glaring issue with this adaptation is the glaring absence of science fiction elements. Merely a fraction of the runtime is dedicated to exploring the fascinating scientific concepts and existential dilemmas that made the novel such a compelling read. Instead, viewers are left with lengthy stretches of tedious character interactions and melodramatic subplots that add little to the overarching narrative.Overreliance on Forward Button:
Thanks to the forward button on the remote, viewers are given the power to bypass the tedious filler content that dominates the majority of the series. With approximately 75% of the runtime consisting of skippable material, one can't help but feel cheated out of the immersive sci-fi experience promised by the source material.Recommendation:
For those daring to venture into the disappointing realm of ""The Three-Body Problem"" on Netflix, it's advisable to keep the remote handy. With judicious use of the forward button, what could have been eight hours of lackluster content can be condensed into a more manageable viewing experience of three hours or so.",IMDB,Science Fiction turned into a boring relationship TV drama,2.0

"Having just finished the amazing Constellation on Apple we were so pleased to see 3 Body Problem had just come out on Netflix.It started so well. The first two episodes were promising, if a little spoon fed in places.The Chinese story line, the murders/suicides of the scientists and investigation of them, the head set and the ""game"". It was all promising.Then the next 6 episodes followed. It suddenly lost its way. It was like a think tank had sat down and come up with every science fiction idea they'd ever had and just couldn't decide which one to go with.So many incomplete stories just falling by the wayside. The absolutely pointless character dying of cancer, his brain and consciousness sent into space for it to all go wrong. I know it lead to the bugs speech, which was a good scene. But what a long drawn out, boring and incomplete story to get there.Maybe I missed parts, as my brain just started to turn off.Thank god for Apple and their science fiction content.

"Adapting novels for the screen often falls short of pleasing original readers, not merely due to the constraints of visual storytelling but due to the vast landscape of imagination that text affords. Each reader's vision of the story is uniquely their own, a phenomenon images struggle to encapsulate fully. For adaptations to truly succeed, they must resonate with a wide audience, faithfully translating the most universally cherished elements of the text while navigating the delicate balance of creative interpretation. However, bold departures risk alienating devoted fans. If you've treasured the original, this adaptation might incite anger and disappointment. If unfamiliar with the source material, it might seem average at best. The advice stands: delve into the novel first, then approach the adaptation with caution. The adaptation's greatest misstep lies in its attempt to localize the narrative within a Western context, avoiding Western taboos through political correctness, yet ironically, this choice only highlights the cultural dissonance further, sparking frustration and disillusionment.",IMDB,No!No!No!,1.0

"This was a slow starter. It wasn't until episode that I realised that, far from being serious science fiction, 3 Body Problem is a gloriously bonkers comedy.It wasn't easy to work out for a start as there was a pretty decent sci-fi storyline emerging in the early episodes. Unfortunately it turned out that the scenes set 60s/70s China were only provided the background for the confused main plot line.There's these scientists or something. Some of them put on VR headsets and play a fancy game made by some people on a boat because of aliens and stuff. There's also a guy who made his fortune selling snacks and his school teacher mate... it was so rushed it was hard to tell. Oh, and a boat gets chopped in half with some carbon nanotubes. Then the sky goes weird and everyone decamps to a stately home to make a nuclear bomb spaceship. Huh?The script is clunky and often laugh-out-loud bad. The only character of any interest is Liam Cunningham's Wade - perhaps the most bonkers and fun character in the whole thing. Wade is the boss of a secretive anti-alien agency which is in the unfortunate situation of having to save humanity on what looks like a budget of a couple of hundred quid. The ""agency"" starts off as just Wade and his gumshoe detective sidekick Da Shi, before rapidly expanding by hiring a Navy captain and some glum looking scientists. When the agency relocate from what looks like a 1970s office block to a stately home, the new found power and an expanded budget go to his head and Wade starts issuing increasing bizarre orders, like: build me a spaceship that can go as fast as light, wake me up from cryo-freeze so I can watch the tennis, blast a teacher's brain into orbit with nuclear bombs. He also spends quite a long time shouting at invisible alien computers (the ""siphone"", the ""cellphone""?).Maybe the book is brilliant. If so, I imagine it was more epic science fiction than batshit comedy romp. And that's the problem. Epic sci-fi is pretty... epic. Stories are often long and complex and it takes real skill to convert them into coherent, well paced scripts which are able to carry an audience without decending into absurd nonsense. It all felt a bit rushed and, ultimately, comically absurd.",IMDB,Comically absurd,4.0

"Well, I most definitely loved the book, but the series... It's okay, but somehow, I expected so much more. The first four episodes is where it all seems to happen, and the binary army computer is just beautifully made - guess crowd simulation often seems to do the trick. Episodes five to eight seem a bit of a timewaster with nothing much happening in them. Looking forward seeing The Dark Forest and Death's End, but not sure if it will be holding up to my expectations. Anyways, it's not a bad Netflix production, but it's also not one of their best. Believe that series like the Queen's Gambit would have been a whole lot less expensive to produce with ultimately a better impact. Think in this case the book still has my personal preference, but who knows, Netflix may up their game and rethink their strategy for the next two books. It just needs to be a whole lot better than this. So, not bad, but not holding up to the book.",IMDB,"Not bad, but expected so much more from this production.",4.0
I'm not picky when it comes to SciFi but nothing in this show makes any sense. All the concepts are utterly bizarre. Aliens that are cruel and malevolent but don't understand deceit. Laughably complicated ways of getting rid of human agents. Even Goldfinger would be laughing at this stuff. Super duper advanced alien tech that does not actually advance the plot in any way shape or form. Not only that but how did it get to earth. Presumably someone put it together. But alas it matters not because all that tech was meaningless nonsense anyway. I'm not sure if it is the source material or the Netflix implementation but it is super sub par.

I can be short about this. The first episodes are promising science fiction about an alien civilisation which makes contact with Earth and are heading towards our planet. But than after a few episodes which make you curious about what's going to happen and make you want te see more it just becomes a lot of scenes of endless and endless conversations between the group of friends.SPOILER ALERT: you will not see any alien nor alien civilisation in the the last episodes.Sometimes it just looks like the writers of this serie just didn't know how to follow up the first episodes and just end up in a lot of talking and talking and talking.,IMDB,"Very, very, very disappointing",2.0
There is the makings of a good show here. However the scientists are supposed to be the most intelligent people on the planet but make the most stupid decision. Furthermore they are incredibly un-likeable.The best characters are the other characters who bring some depth and interest to the show.It's also rather slow. It needs a bit faster pacing and some more interesting characters that are likeable. I hope that the second season is far more interesting and has some really good exciting episodes that raise the bar and has some really good cliff hangers and jaw dropping moments.

"Nothing hurts to watch more than shows like this one.It full of interesting ideas, full of seemingly brilliant scientists and what not. There's a big but to all of this, paper thin plot that doesn't pass the low effort scrutiny and all those geniuses just acting dumb, and not showing any of the intelligence that would be associated with their wealth of knowledge.Wiseman said that character can only be as smart as the person who writes him.Hence the best SCI-FI in history came from people who were equal scholars to writers. Science fiction is about science, and core of science is logic. This what this show lacks, and it's just sad.I feel like if characters and let's call it 'the enemy' were making logical choices this story would be a at best feature film long.What we got is pile of contrivance that forces characters to move through story bits.It's not helped by the fact that lead characters are quite unlikeable, smarty pants attitudes, mean to their peers, simply insufferable.Felt like I was watching mean girls but there was no comedy. The show as good cast though, and capable actors but not all of them look very excited to be there and do their job.Liam Cunningham on the other hand, he took every scene he was in by the throat, he has a commanding screen presence in any show he's in, hat off to him.The show overall moves the story at a good pace and is full or exciting reveals, but they will boggle your mind, and make you say what? What now? Really?I made a mistake of confronting reveals with previous events, and with things we learn by episode 6 nothing has a chance to happen the way it did.I don't think show runners desired for bewildered confusion, but that is what I got, my brain is moosh.

"Why is the only character I liked the one that is about to die? He seems like the only one that does not act like a child, but he can't because he has cancer. He does not have many speaking parts... maybe that is why I liked him.It also seemed like they were more worried about diversity of ethnicity than they were a coherent story. It was very choppy at times. Then there were other times where they were trying to be mysterious, but it turned out to just be annoyingly cryptic... I would watch a scene over and over again not able to figure out what was going on. Then 5 minutes later they would introduce a completely different factor and connect it to that cryptic scene and leave you more confused than ever. I wish they would have focused on older actors... it would have made this far more suspenseful... a good story is better than a bringing political correctness into a film. The detective has a kid and they had to make a point to tell the audience that the kid was gay... how did that move the story along? It did not... no one cares about how characters prefer their sexual proclivities, especially when it is a character that does not even have a story line. It's like they just needed to check the box... gay character, check. If sexual preferences are not needed to further a story line, then please don't bring them up to check a box. It's not that being gay is bad in a movie, it's just annoying that they spend all this time checking boxes when they need to be explaining the cryptic PLOT AND STORY! This is what is so frustrating about art nowadays... it can't bring you into the art without trying to pound specific views or narratives in your head... like we need lessons from Hollywood of all places.Anyway, there is not much that made sense here. Had SO MUCH potential if they would have just stuck to the source material and followed it. Instead, they wanted to check boxes. We should have an inclusive art industry no doubt, but it shouldn't be done like this. This is insulting to the author, the viewer, the fans of the books, and even the actors... because some of them are getting ripped apart for being miscast. Why does it hurt to stay with the source material and what works. Not every show has to have a gay person in it. Not every show has to have a white, black, Hispanic, or Asian person in it. Not every show needs to have a woman or man in it. We have SO MANY GREAT STORIES in this world to make, stories of brave, kind, funny people from every back ground... so why take those stories away from them and force them into stories they don't fit into (based on the source material, not superficial things).The Aliens make no sense. They lied themselves. Now they hate liars? They allowed people to call them Lord. They knew they were not a Lord. The original one said they were a pacifist and that the rest of them were violent, yet the ones speaking to the cult leader said they are ALL ONE and know what each other are thinking, so they cannot lie. So how is this pacifist Alien separate from the rest of them if they are all ONE?The writers and directors should have focused on STORY instead of checking boxes and they would have caught all this stuff.My favorite characters in the show was Marlo Kellys. She acted like a psychopath very well and I really wanted her to be successful in her endeavors. The way she uses her eyes reminds me a lot of Aubrey Plaza, who is an amazing actress.

It is hardly possible to understand what is happening and why. I don't want to at least somehow empathize and sympathize with the characters and the world in the series.

"Something that will pop out immediately after watching 30mins of first episode is how substandard character development is. If you somehow ignore and overcome that, you would be appalled with kindergarten dialogues and subpar acting as well as casting. Lead actress with her lip job looks more like a playboy model than a scientist.But what gets to you really hard is how meek and lowly scientists behave. I get it, this is Netflix quality production, which has to be alt left filled with cliches and dorky jokes so that the average westerner can enjoy this show while eating food which they got through their favorite food deliver app.Book or not, a topic like this needs deep intellect, resonance, and philosophy to realize it's importance - all of which are beyond Netflix's production values.I've moved on to the Chinese version and although I find the dialogues difficult to understand through subtitles, I do get enough substance to think and encapsulate this thought-provoking TV Show.I truly wish some other production house in North America would have picked the book for screenplay adaption.

Sci fi is my favorite genre of fiction, and the 3 Body Problem permeated my feed for a couple of years.Hence my disappointment: if you, like me, were hoping to watch the next television event after Game of Thrones, I'm sorry to say that this is not it.It's a shame that such a good story has been adapted into such a silly series.PLOT:
From what I've been able to research after finishing the last episode, a lot has been ""adapted"" (completely changed) from the original source, and usually for the worse. Despite this, the plot itself is very interesting, although confusing and a little too crazy.In fact, these changes are what make the series such a bizarre narrative. The flashbacks in China are memorable, full of emotion and high drama, while everything that takes place in London is like a mixture of the most boring seasons of Westworld and some teen drama.CAST:
The cast is a mess. Some good actors are badly cast, like Jonathan Pryce and Alex Sharp, while others shine, like Jess Hong as Jin Cheng and Zine Tseng as Ye Wenjie.The characters themselves are pretty bland, a group of geniuses who act like scumbag university students. Saul gets one of the coolest plot points in the series, but he's a loser, cynical pothead... Auggie (although well portrayed by Eiza Gonzalez) is completely one note, and John Bradley plays the most unpleasant guy in the world.At least Bradley didn't reprise his role as Sam Tarly from GoT, while Liam Cunningham continues to play Davos Seaworth, only in this universe he is more like Stannis Baratheon.DIRECTION/PRODUCTION/MUSIC
I don't know what happened in these areas, but it's all pretty mediocre. The VR scenes are tedious and with PS1 CGI..., as well as a dull humor that kills any tension in the story; the soundtrack is like something recycled from Westworld (which isn't bad, but it's not great either); and the production itself is dreadful, with Galileo wearing modern glasses and a stylish tuft...Seriously, it looks like the series was developed by 2 completely different teams, because the flashback scenes are excellent; everyone is dirty, looks tired, etc. While the present-day scenes show soldiers working in the hot Panamanian sun, but their clothes are perfectly ironed and smooth.In short, the series is watchable, but that's about it.

Yes you are cool we get it, but it just sounds vulgar nothing else.Oxford five is a group of losers, these are not scientists at all.

Watched episode 3 on the Uber home I was so in enthralled.Sadly, I finished episode 6, and am having to call it quits. It feels slapped together, lacking development and any depth, void of subtlety, character actions are nonsensical for no reason... massive events just happen with no lead up or planning or thought or emotions, and the love interest scenarios feel forced and uninteresting. I'll give that the benefit of the doubt though as maybe it actually does play some role in the plot later rather than just shoved in for no reason.Pretty bummed to have so quickly gone from falling asleep with thoughts about the show running through my head and captivating me, to trying to force my way through episode 7 before giving up and buying the books.

On one hand the series tries to stick to the novels while on the other it actively rebels against them. I guess it had a few good moments.

A plot so predictable it had me fast forwarding through the final two episodes. With no originality and a limited scale that makes a global conflict seem limited to a small town, you have to wonder if this is just another money grab project for Netflix.But of course this will trend, as the algorithms force feed simple content down our throats. I long for the next great sci fi series.",IMDB,Basic; sitcomy,1.0
"Let me start by saying I have not read any material or watched anything on this but know it's regarded as the best science fiction ever written. So with that being said I have no skin in the game but expected in a way greatness to be shown to me. I'm left underwhelmed and kind of disappointed. To the average consumer that is like me thats has no clue about anything on this subject, I wanted to get introduced into something amazing and understand the genius of it but I'm left uninspired. There wasn't nearly enough science explained or shown and although the first 2 episodes hook you in with a murder mystery and even a mystery of who is trying to solve the murders, the breakdown of all science which still didn't clarify or dive into, the countdown, the video game and overall tone felt exciting and I wanted to see more of that but it quickly disappears or is resolved. These group of friends that are supposed to be some of earth's brightest seem to have a boring teenage drama about them or just uniteresting character development or story besides maybe 2 of them. It's greatest parts were the Chinese flashback story and the early mystery of everything then it quickly becomes a humanity vs aliens with not enough to keep it alfoat of curiosity. It's called 3 body problem (in which they figure out and don't dive into and move on from completely) but it really is more of * Oxford 5* problem.",IMDB,There is a problem..,5.0
"Spoilers ahead!!Watched all 8 episodes. Disappointed!I haven't read the books, but I couldn't believe it had such enormous hype. I hope this isn't a true adaptation.For a story revolving around physicists, this makes a mockery of the entire scientific community. Fate of humanity rests on the hands of a bunch of post-docs from a single dept of one university all working under the same professor? Yeah why not! Let's not forget one of them is a potato chips salesman.Where are the astrobiologists? Nuclear physicists? Experimentalists? Astroliguists? Engineers? Don't ask!Atleast they could have developed these characters better to make us believe in them. For instance, they could have been PhDs or postdocs whose careers have taken them into different paths. They're all in their 40s or 50s, now they are the who's who in their respective fields, with many scientists and engineers working under them. And they meet after many years at the funeral of their professor. Atleast that would have been believable.There's no background information about their scientific contributions. We are just told ""they're from Oxford, they're young, and working in (insert some science-y sounding words) and so they're the best"". That's it!There is no teamwork. Everyone is a specialist in something. Occasionally one of them goes to the other and says ""can you do this for me?"", and the other person does it all alone in a computer, like a bunch of fairies waving magic wands. I'm sorry creators of the show, that's not how science and engineering works.Atleast I could have forgiven the creators if only they introduced these characters any better than how they did. The way they introduce the two ladies in that bar scene, just instantly lowered my expectations for the show. I went in expecting a GoT level show.. Gosh was I so disappointed.. If you're a budding screenwriter reading this review, please remember this: scientists would never talk about themselves in such a bombastic way, especially if they're so early in their careers, and that too to a stranger who's clearly not a scientist himself. Watch Oppenheimer, Arrival, Interstellar, Contact to know how real scientists talk. If that's how you introduce your main characters, it's just an instant turn off. How can we root for a person like that?There are so many loopholes in the story. Like, why just China figured out how to talk to aliens? Nasa here sending people to the moon and robots to mars and probes to Pluto but couldn't figure out how to send a signal to the sun? And why only this Wong guy and his boss investigate the murders of these scientists? Clearly they're dying everywhere, not just in the UK. A senior scientist in India died by suicide? Yeah let's wait for the never-heard-before detective working for a shady UK govt organization to arrive at the crime scene.If the aliens are so powerful that they listen to every single conversation happening at every location in the world, and they could cover the entire planet with a weapon the size of a proton, how come they're so dumb as to not find another habitable planet somewhere nearby to their star? With such technology, you don't even need a habitable planet. You can just simply terraform any planet.And what's with that stupid VR game thing? It's such an elaborate subplot just to reveal the evil plan of the bad guys. I thought bond villains are the worst!Why slice through an entire ship like a vegetable chopper slicing an onion, just to recover a hard drive? Imagine you're the head of MI6, and you ask your subordinates to come up with a plan for a covert operation to retrieve a hard drive from a cruise ship, and this is the plan your subordinates come up with. This is like letting Peter Griffin device a plan for capturing Bin laden. Just makes no sense at all!And why choose a high school teacher's brain as your choice for communicating with the aliens? What about the thousands of octogenarians and septuagenarians who spent their entire lives trying to talk to aliens? Surely at least one of them must be in their death beds, and would definitely jump at such an opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, it's like Stranger things met interstellar.But I just sincerely hope that some of these plot holes are eventually addressed in future seasons. I haven't read the books, so I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt at the moment. If not, even a 3/10 would become too generous of me.This once again reinforces the belief that Benioff and Weiss are nothing without the genius of GRRM. The moment they start putting their own brains into their creations, their true creativity is visible for everyone to see.",IMDB,Spoof tv show by mixing Stranger things and interstellar,3.0

"It literally says - you're too stupid to understand physical terms, phenomena, theories. I'll oversimplify it so much that it doesn't make sense anymore. But you'll be left with the feeling that you've watched something clever.Why? Because MOST of people don't like to think much. They want - to be entertained.And that's fine as long as we are not talking specifically about sci fi.If you don't want the complexity of science, you want entertaiment - choose something else...
But NO, you take sci fi and turn it into MEDIOCRE netflix drama.In Three-Body (Chinese version) you learn about many scientific phenomena, which are presented in quite understandable manner. And I enjoyed watching that kind of show.Whereas in this show nothing is really explained, it's fast for no reason, many nuances are distorted. For example, in Three-Body the main hero saw the flickering universe only with a use of special glasses, because our eye CAN NOT see relict radiation. But NO, Auggie Salazar somehow has that capacity.I think moments like this kill the whole charm of the original Three-Body series, which tried to explain such phenomena, not to impress and cheaply entertain.So yeah, I fully agree with this comment ""The adaptation dumbs down the source material for TV ""

"I had high hopes for this title as I love the original book so much, and like the Chinese TV series.However, this one make a great sci-fi with great story settings, DEEP PHILOSOPHY and SCIENCE discussions into a plain and simple ""there's some bad alien and bad guy, let's fight them together in the group of CHOSEN ONES, and we should have complex love, sex and other relationships"" story.1st, all characters are kind of lack of depth. Especially Ye Wenjie, who was a soul character, has very complex background and thoughts, so she once hate human, then begin to love some of the human, feeling a little conflict on welcoming the 3 body alien, but still lean towards 3 body alien may bring better things to human. In this movie, I only see hate, blind belief, and... sex? Saul Durand is the role of Luo Ji, who is key to all 3 books, however, he looks like a minor role the whole season, then at last 2 episode, suddenly push him to become a wallfacer. Auggie Salazar should be an important scientist character, but never saw she really worked on science stuff, more like an entrepreneur who drinks and smokes a lot, and always unable to resist the impulse, doesn't seem very rational.2nd, all major storylines are very rushed, it's like suddenly some setting jumped out, without enough, or even no scenes to develop the story. Like why we choose the nano line to cut the ship, why we need wallfacer, all like from nowhere.3rd, the details and story logic are bad. Initially, why Ye Wenjie took the blame on the forbidden book is not clear, just due to blind love on someone who betrayed her? Why is everything about a small group of people from Oxford? Just because they are THE CHOSEN ONES? Why use nano technology to cut the boat? Seems Evans doesn't want to destroy the hard drive at all, her run for mins and didn't destroy it, Just Sent SWAT TEAM! Why did Saul sit with Da Shi in an open Motel Garden after the assassin? He is eager to be killed? How does the cutting edge VR headset come from? Even though 3 body provide the design, Earth doesn't have the equipment and technology to manufacture those kinds of things yet!4th, the visual effect is not good enough, does the universe blink like broken lights? No details on the cutting boat scene also.Last but not least, a lot of important deeper conversation are gone, mainly ALL DEEPER PHILOSOPHY and SCIENCE discussions are missing from this TV series, make the story from a great personal, social and science discussion, into a plain and simple ""there's some bad alien and bad guy, let's fight them together in the group of CHOSEN ONES"" story.",IMDB,"Losing All the Depth, and Not Even a Good ""Save the Earth"" show",2.0

Production values were good and some of the set pieces were visually impressive. The characters were cliched and all huffy urgency and faux anger. Acting was ok. Luam Cunningham chewed a lot of scenes. Perhaps it lost something in transposing the novels from the original Chinese setting.

The actions of the characters and the whole narrative becomes plain stupid in a manner that it is insulting inteligence.I was so annoyed that I stopped watching in the middle of the episode 7.

"Sorry, the following is an AI translation
Lack of scientific literacy and illogical reasoning. The artificial intelligence of the human computer has become a sign, which even makes the computer logic wrong. Apart from black and white, there are also double black and double white and no sign, without such basic scientific literacy.And the flicker of the universe, visible to the naked eye? Can you tell me how Zhizi can do it? The Tencent version still needs to be observed through 3k glasses, which turns you into the naked eye. It lacks scientific literacy and goes against the horror of the original work that ""the entire universe only flickers for you."".And the Red Bank base is transmitting signals, but Ye Wenjie and his team are actually standing directly under the radar? The director obviously doesn't know how much microwave radiation this radar has, because with his scientific literacy, he can only understand what is visible. Is it difficult to use one's brain to think about whether a person standing below would suffer serious harm, even if the death of a flying bird is clearly displayed? A science fiction work with so many low-level errors is like elementary school students telling stories, terrible!The changes to the characters also completely lose their complexity. Although Ye Wenjie suffered persecution during the Cultural Revolution, she lost hope for human self rescue. But she is a savior rather than a descendant, believing that Trisolarans have a higher moral level to transform humanity. In the hands of Netflix, there is only bitter hatred left, and the flat character design has made her lose her charm. Many characters have lost their charm, and the director cannot understand the complexity of their thoughts. He can only use plain behavior to show his first impression of the characters, and interpret this excellent work in the form of low-quality fast food. This is the tragedy of the Three Body Problem book
Poor quality special effects, the special effects of the flying blade cutting ship are like CG from ten years ago, and the reason for choosing flying blade cutting in the original work is: 1. There are very few innocent people on the ship, only one canal navigator, minimizing innocent casualties. 2. The movement is small, and the speed is fast. Can avoid discovering and destroying hard drive data in Evans. There has been a complete change here, with so many children on board. Is this ETO headquarters or a primary school outing yacht? Killing so many innocent people is an insult to this plan. And Evans has such a long reaction time, even holding data in his arms. Why didn't he destroy it?

"Haven't read the books, haven't seen the Chinese series. Watching this show, starts very interesting, discovering whats happening, slow paced, mysterious, good plot..up until 5th episode.Then it turns into a disappointment from David and David, once again. I dont know if these dudes have a limited potion of creativity for their shows, where if they use much in the beginning there is none left for the ending.Starting from the ship scene, where the military discussion is what is the best and quickest way to get the harddrive, without casualties and without putting the drive in danger of being destroyed... Yet they choose the most dangerous method of slicing everything and the ship burns.. But they do find the drive undamaged ofc.Aliens who are so advanced to travel in spaceships with 1% speed of light, and sophons to change our reality, actually cant find a closer place to live and terraform (i dont even know if they breathe oxygen, as they say they dont look like humans at all and are multidimensional beings) but they just decide to come and destroy humans and live on earth... Ofc.Building a capsule with a parachute that opens into space(in vacuum)..precisely following a route where atom bombs are set that explode right between the parachute and the capsule... I'm amazed how they managed tonput those atom bombs so quickly, what materials were used to protect the chute and the capsule (with a half-frozen human inside) that protects from atomic blast and radiation... Ofc.Im not even going to mention how amazing is that five friends from school have the luck to be the inventor of nanotechnology polymer, a physicist who solves the game and the space problem, the guy who in his mind will find the solution and the guy who is dying so is the perfect candidate to travel frozen to the aliens(and still don't get why)..I'm totally going to not laugh at the poor attempts to create a drama of love interests and pointless conflicts, same as the attempt to create guilt to anyone not working for the ""human"" side...

"Remember ""Another life"", the abysmal netflix show where a supposedly handpicked space expedition had its characters display the mental state, intelligence, tropes and team dynamics of a random group of college freshmen sharing a flat? Well, the netflix ""Three Body Problem"" will bring you the exact same experience, somewhat propped up by a much larger budget and sometimes using the source material. This time though, we have a bunch of characters with the dynamics of a generic soap opera who are supposedly world-leading physicists.Ultimately, even as a stand-alone source, the show is passable at best. Characters are extremely flat, dialogues feel from forced to outright cringeworthy in how much they mismatch the characters and their delivery. The ""streamlined"" story feels overloaded with irrelevant points at the expense of the main storyline, which seems to minimise the ""science"" in ""science fiction"" It's insulting the intelligence of audience with its avoidance of anything remotely beyond the most basic science. ""The Expanse"" showed you can make a great show and still introduce physics concepts to the viewers, who will love it. Whether by incompetence or indifference, the Netflix ""3BP"" seems to be unable to do it. The source material means it's still an Ok watch, but if you sleep through half an episode, you probably won't miss anything.As an adaptation the show is terrible. The plot has been butchered with the key message and theme completely missing, replaced with soap opera nonsense.The character swaps by themselves aren't good or bad. The should could have been a great opportunity to represent a female lead in a male-dominated field like physics, like ""Queen's Gambit"" was for chess.

It just seems like they flew through it as quickly as possible doing every scene by numbers. As someone who enjoys quality cinema this was an absolute famine for me.So, with nothing to enjoy visually you are left with the meat of the story which had interesting ideas but was a bit 'this happens then this happens then this happens' without any real intrigue or tension beyond 'so... what's the deal with these aliens? Maybe we'll get an answer at the end...' Everything seems to happen a bit too quickly without any real depth. I was interested enough to get answers to the questions but didn't really care about a single character, although the big bloke from GoT was fairly likeable and the show seemed to miss his charisma when he died as no one else had any.People seem to love this story enough that I have to believe there's more to it than what I watched so I am currently in the process of downloading the Tencent version.",IMDB,Artistic Void,5.0

Emotional range of a plank with two possible expressions - worried and afraid, and nothing in between is difficult to place into any serious conversation.

"(UPDATE: I am leaving my original negative review for this series below, but adding this preface since I just watched the first two episodes of the original Chinese series, which is already much better. In the 2nd episode of the Chinese version they go into a detailed metaphor of ""physics is broken"" using a pool table. Now I get what's missing in the Netflix version: this show is supposed to be about the science. The way the new US series abbreviates those elements takes away the most important part of the show. That's why I gave is the bad review below.)Since I watched the whole series I feel compelled to write a review. This is either a bad adaptation of a good book or an accurate adaptation of a bad book. I don't know since I never read it. But after an intriguing first 3 episodes the story becomes full of holes and strained attempts at emotional moments. The characters seemed plastic neo-generic caricatures. What should have been huge dramatic moments felt rushed. I mean, the night sky blinks on and off and somehow the world goes back to normal after a few days? I dunno. There was no scope to this story. It should have been longer and had a wider societal breadth. There must be something from the novel they didn't capture because there were a lot of unexplained cryptic exchanges... especially in the joke that Ye tells Saul. I was waiting for that to take on some relevance in the story but... nope. I have a feeling it was cryptic information on how to fight the aliens...? Maybe it's explained in season 2... if there is one? Otherwise, why all focus on that story? And the subplot about the man who was dying of cancer...? They kept trying to create these moving moments but failing, imo. I didn't care what happened to the guy. So they sent his brain into space so the aliens could clone him... maybe? It just doesn't make any sense. And whoever wrote that scene where they use the nanofibers to slice up the ship doesn't understand anything about the Panama Canal. The ships have to move into locks where the water level is changed. There are hundreds of way they could have secured that ship while it was in a lock. It just seemed like such an over the top way to get the disc. I continued watching mainly because I was genuinely curious to see where it would all wind up. But I must admit it was almost as big a let down as the end of season 1 of ""From"". In the end it's just another story about aliens coming to take our stuff. And that just seems so old school now. While it wasn't awful it was a little plastic to me.",IMDB,Just another story about aliens coming to take our stuff.,4.0
"The story is so far fetched that it is completely unbelievable snd an insult to science. No wonder with the ""scientists"" who are working on an imaginary problem. And I am not even talking about the inacceptable high number of miscast characters , especially those in England. Their specialty serms to be to communicate the f word in every second of their utterings. Shame of the screenwriters that seem to suffer from a lack of subtlety and intelligence.

"I stayed up late last night to finish the Netflix adaptation of The Three-Body Problem. The writers straightened out some minor plot bugs from the original novel, and the visuals were done well, but it still gave me a feeling of being as flat as cardboard.I thought about why, and suddenly realized that in the original novel there were many seemingly scattered plots that actually revolved around the singular event of the First Contact and its impact on people. Things like the motivations behind the Red Bank base, the betrayal of Bai Mulin, Yang Weining's death, the life in the northeastern village, the chant ""Buddha bless the Lord"", the different factions in ETO, etc. But this adaptation cut out all of those elements and added some cheap emotional subplots instead, making the first contact feel like meh, which completely defuses the power the original book.",IMDB,Disappointing,3.0

"To make a review short, the first three episodes are 90% science fiction. They are pretty interesting and exciting.After the third episode, the series becomes a soap opera, stretched, primarily dull, not logical, mostly about people's relationships and emotions.By the way, the casting and acting of the actors is terrible.I believed in only Jin Cheng and Thomas Wade acting.I don't want to judge Netflix, but I really don't remember when I have seen some good file/serial on Netflix, for at least 2-3 years. I hope they will not continue to make new episodes based on this original book. At least not in such quality.",IMDB,"Started not bad, but finished...",3.0
"Not quite respect to the original novel. It is true that the novel is such complicated to be visualised and be filmed. It is true that TV series will do some editorial on the plot based on the novel. However, it seems far beyond. To most of fans of the novel, the episode losses respects to the origin. It is nearly to re-write a plot with the concept of three body problem. Thus, it shouldn't be named as three body problem.As a Chinese, watching the episodes, just feel that Netflix only take shots of the part that Chinese creators aren't able to shoot in China if they want to publish in plublic. Other than that, it isn't the three body problems.It seems to extend the vision, however, it narrows the big concept of what the author wants to express.",IMDB,5 for creators.,5.0
"After I finished the first 4 episodes, I wanted to rate this show 9/10.

Episode 6, 7 and 8 are mostly dialogues and many of them are insignificant, boring and bad written! It feels like I'm watching a different show.I just don't understand why they have to cut off so many important info and many of the characters became boring and flat.

"Before watching this and even before reviewing i did not know this was based off a book, therefor this review will be based off those experiences.The first 3-4 episodes are good, enticing and suspenseful sci-fi style episodes. I was drawn in and committed to the story. The element of mystery is very strong and compelling making you want to see where this goes.Then it falls of a cliff and flatlines like a vast ocean against a mountain (kinda like a certain scene funny enough). It turns into a day's of our lives drama touchy touchy feel good look at me show and you begin to think to yourself ""This is not what i signed up for, what am i even watching anymore"".There is a scene/event that happens in episode 5 which is just crazy and brings the show briefly back to extremely interesting, but this is just a mere spike before flatlining again, never really picking back up until finally falling off into oblivion.Maybe based on the books it will pick back up in season 2, but i am reviewing season 1 from a blind perspective and frankly will only watch season 2 if i'm desperate.",IMDB,Squandered Potential,5.0
"As a longtime fan of the books, my expectations for this adaptation were high. However, I found that Saul and Auggie's portrayals significantly detracted from the series. Their characters seemed unnecessary and were particularly grating, which often pulled me out of the story. For example, Saul's constant pessimism didn't seem to add to the plot and could have been moderated for a more balanced character. Auggie's overly sarcastic tone and constant emotional instability felt out of place compared to the source material. If these characters had been either omitted or written with more depth and less annoyance, in a more realistic manner, the series could have been an 8 out of 10. Despite this, the adaptation did have its strengths, such as following the overall events of the series. By refining these characters, or just sticking to the source material, the series could better capture the essence of the beloved books.",IMDB,"OK, but could have easily been much better.",3.0

"As a big fan of ""The Three-Body Problem"" books, I was really looking forward to Netflix's adaptation. The books stand out because they don't have clear-cut heroes or villains - it's all about people navigating complex situations.However, the Netflix series seems to have missed that subtlety. It quickly sets up a clear divide between good and evil, losing the nuanced character motivations that are central to the books. It's a bit disappointing to see the story's moral complexities smoothed over like this.Also, setting the series in London feels like a missed opportunity. The book's global perspective is one of its strengths, emphasizing a united human response to an extraterrestrial threat. By narrowing the focus to one city, particularly a Western one, the show loses some of the original's universal appeal.In short, while the Netflix series might be entertaining on its own, it doesn't fully capture the spirit of the books. It's a more straightforward interpretation, which might not satisfy those who appreciated the original's depth and global scale.",IMDB,For me it missed the point of the books,2.0
"Netflix, where are your special effects? What are these things? What did you film about Operation Guzheng in the original novel?The core of human nature in the original work is not reflected at all, and the plot is very empty.Also, why were the kissing scenes between Ye Wenjie and Evans included and why were Ye Wenjie and Bai Mulin having sex? This seems ridiculous. How could a woman like Ye Wenjie be someone who only thinks about sex?The screenwriter couldn't understand the original work at all, nor could he understand the relationship between Ye Wenjie and the men around him in the original work, let alone Ye Wenjie's thoughts.The writing is really terrible. Messed up everything. The director is also very bad. I don't understand why you want to replace the ETO organization members on the ship with children. What is your purpose?",IMDB,"Netflix, what's wrong with you?",1.0
"The best part was the first 10 minutes in episode 1 set in China in the 60's. When it jumps to present day England the wheels well and truly come off.Starting with the terrible casting and amateur soap opera acting. For the most part, the so called scientists don't look remotely believable (due to their ages) or even talk like real scientists. Its all low level fluff in terms of dialogue, how the actors look, and act.The scene in the bar in episode 1 where they rebuff the hapless guy chatting them up was laughable and so ""cringe"". That's when I knew what the producers were going for, which is a cheesy, light hearted, soapy daytime show.And they have it in spades.As expected, all stereotypes are present for modern audiences in terms of cast/characters (yawn)Netflix prove once again they can only largely produce content for the young reality tv generation.",IMDB,Very amateur with all stereotypes present and correct,1.0
"Being a sci-fi enthusiast, and having heard of the books long prior to the Netflix series, I was quite hopeful for a great sci-fi, but this is just BAD. The concept itself is quite braindead, along with all the smaller concepts within that make up the whole, and aside from that you have a bunch of contrived and nonsensical drama mechanisms, such as the terminally ill dude who is in love with the lead physicist. All the characters destined to supposedly be key players in an interstellar war to save the human race happen to be good drinking buddies, like it was originally a storyboard for an episode of Scooby-Doo or something. The only saving grace for this series for me was Eiza Gonzalez's ABSOLUTELY EXQUISITE MOUTH. What an insanely gorgeous actress! And not a bad actress at that, but hardly good enough to salvage a trainwreck of a series idea like this. I'm not even sure this is any kind of issue with how well the work was adapted, because here it seems just the concept itself is plainly quite daft. Overambitious to the point of being painfully unrefined and uninteresting. The entire series feels like it struggles so mightily to explain the concepts that the story just isn't interesting anymore, and none of the blatantly contrived dramatic mechanisms fit in a way that engages the viewer. This is like sitting at the dinner table and listening to your 14 year old nerd cousin rattle off his latest role-playing game campaign idea he plagiarized from a video-game he'd been playing, cringing and begging for it to end. If you're going to write a sci-fi that needs to be a saga because it takes place over the span of 400+ years, then you need to do it with a lot more craft than this, because this series is going nowhere fast. The idea itself is lackluster. Someone aims a satellite at the Sun, which supposedly amplifies its signal to an extraterrestial race 4 lightyears away in a 3 star system, presumably Alpha Centauri, since it is the only documented system which fits this description within 4 lightyears distance. They make contact with an alien species called the San-Ti, who apparently have faced many extinction events on their own homeworld over the span of millions of years and have thereby come into possession of technology so advanced it allows them to communicate at sub-light speed, going so far as to project whatever images they want onto humans, able to make supercomputers the size of protons that propel themselves faster than light and that grow large enough to encircle the entire Earth and block out the sky, and supposedly, despite many great cataclysms (which apparently weren't so cataclysmic since they went on and on...) were able to build an entire interstellar fleet that can travel at 1% the speed of light all the way to Earth. All this to say that in about 440 years after first contact, 400 years known publicly by the masses of humanity, some aliens would be arriving to conquer the Earth. Ok. That's some ground to cover in ABSOLUTE BOREDOM. This means the only projected excitement until then is that we watch humans dig a really big figurative trench? No idea where they're going with this, but season 1 was utterly a forgettable SNOREFEST. Add some very tenous physics into the mix, in the form of humans lining up a chain of nuclear warheads in space to propel a solar sail (bro... all that would do is melt the solar sail and obliterate the probe, use your freakin' brain...), or making a supercomputer by having a million soldiers hold some picket signs and flip them back and forth, possibly utterly at random, to come up with some exact, obscur calculation (literally as if the only function of this was for the visual impact of seeing a million dudes fliping binary-colored picket signs en masse, since the concept is clearly nonsensical in the extreme...). Introducing a dramatic mechanism in the form of a forlorn lover stricken by terminal illness who heroicly offers his living brain for experimentation. Trying to make the entire plot mysterious by burying it under 40-odd years of an omniscient secret society that can make itself invisile to cameras, and knows everything whenever it is deemed it would make the plot more interesting, but is utterly oblivious whenever it is deemed that there WOULD BE NO PLOT IF THEY KNEW EVERYTHING?... The entire thing reeks of amateurism. This seems to likely have originated from a book that fringe sci-fi readers have tried to forcefully hype, rather than a work that has gained momentum on the merit of its originality or genius. I might tune in for a second season just out of the sheer hope that it miraculously all comes together in some way that makes having invested all this time in such a disappointing first season worthwhile, but so far, this is NOT The Expanse. Not remotely. It's not even Star Trek The Next Generation, or even Bablyon 5, quite frankly. Doubt this would have been hyped if it were the product of a western mind, moreover since so much like it has already been written by western authors. I REALLY strongly feel that being of Chinese origin is the ONLY thing this story has going for it. All the more power to you if that's your thing, but honestly, I don't think ""exoticism"" really applies to writing, particularly of the sci-fi or fantasy varieties, which really should always be cultureless in essence to begin with.A trio of Game of Thrones actors to see here, if that's your thing, but the real talk of the town is Eiza Gonzalez. Again, WHAT an UTTERLY EXQUISITE MOUTH on the young woman. Just a gorgeous creature, and one of the more interesting and engaging actors herein.Again, I will glady eat my words and feel like my screentime has been refunded if this somehow shapes into anything actually interesting and original in future seasons, but so far all it has done is to make me lose interest in the books altogether, on the assumption that they're anything like what is being presented here.I'll give it 3 stars out of 10, one to represent each of the bodies in the ""3 Body Problem"", so we can call it the ""3 Star Problem"", to be nice and gimmicky like most of this story's plot devices...",IMDB,"More like the ""3 Star Problem"" now...

"My wife stopped watching the series midway because she felt it was like a teenage drama, with reactions and actions possibly influenced by hormonal imbalances. But I continued after having 2-3 more drinks. Additionally, the five friends in the series share the common background of attending Oxford, which seems to suggest that only bright minds come from there, a notion rarely seen in reality. The series is so boring; it does not appeal to any science-loving mind nor the general public. It seems like a poorly written series, no doubt crafted by a team also responsible for the worst season of GOT when they faced writing without any book available. Extra 2 stars just for the concept borrowed from the book. Now, I planing to buy the translated version of the book instead and experience its true content.",IMDB,"No science, just teenage drama",3.0
"I am not sure where is the problem. Either Chinese storytelling is too different from Western storytelling or it is a bad adaptation of a great book, or the book is outright boring too (I didn't read it, and from what I have seen in this show, there is no chance I will). The show pace is very slow. It is supposed to be about an alien invasion, but there is little or no hint of the supposed aliens. Even the science is flawed, something I can stand if the storytelling is great (yeah, there is not such a thing like a Death Star, but who cares?...).This is the second recent show I have seen about an alien invasion with little or no aliens and a poor script. I hope it will improve. Writers should stop trying to do scripts for a very small subset of the viewers, and focus more on doing enjoyable shows.",IMDB,"Boring, boring",4.0
"The premise of the show is intriguing, but certain casting choices hard to swallow. As someone who works at a top university and occasionally crosses paths with remarkable scientists, many of whom are seasoned with significant experience (over the age of 40. . . At least), frankly, the characters seem too young to be 'remarkable scientists.' This takes away from the believability of the story and makes it a hard watch.I'm probably a stick in the mud on this, but for me characters have to align in age or approximate age with the character's professional background. That's like my pet peeve. I mean, a 20 year old super scientist doesn't work for a serious storyline, unless it's a comedy. And really, is there any, allow me to create a word, ""scientisting"" going on here? This is typical Hollywood over the past 30 years. Let's target the age of who we think will view this movie. Never mind the actual story and characters.There's more, the story lacks a connection to the characters. It's possible that this disconnect is from the overarching focus on a future event, coupled with it being a series. A television series provides ample opportunity for character development, but with this targeted under 21-30 audience and no feeling for the characters this also makes it a hard watch.I am intrigued by the premise and curious to see how it unfolds, but as it stands, I may not be on board to finish this season.Maybe I should read the book!",IMDB,Many More Problems!,4.0

"Terrible.Granted, the books have their flaws. Unlike GRR Martin, Liu Cixin does not write compelling characters. The dialogue of the books is wooden and the cast lacks personality, except for perhaps Ye Winjie and Da Shi, to an extent.D&D, of Game of Thrones infamy and producers of 3 Body Problem, struggle to write their own scrips and fill in the gaps. Cixin left them a lot of gaps, and they filled it with the same stuff that GoT seasons 5 and beyond were made of.Some of the flaws:
The casting is largely terrible. The stunningly beautiful Eiza González as CSO of a nonofiber startup is a downright bizarre choice. For a main character, her acting is also quite sub par (although I hate blaming actors for casting when they're given a terrible script). Casting Jonathan Price as a religious fanatic is such an blatant nod to GoT that it makes his character hard to appreciate.The script is cringeworthy. Dialogue is wooden and full of clichés. Liam Cunningham's character, Thomas Wade, is probably the worst offender. It's like he has the effect on people around him that all spoken words must emphasise just how bad ass he is.The newly introduced characters have a bunch of early-thirties drama going on that is so annoying and wooden. The world is ending and I have to watch these infants argue about nothing.The plot doesn't fare much better. Avoiding spoilers: the nanofiber scene was just outright ridiculous.

Acting and photography is mature and with depth. Older characters such as Cunningham, Chao, Wong and Pryce bring a lot to their roles, as well as our GoT hero John Bradley in possibly the most interesting and real character of the entire show.

"Not a big sci-fi fan, but I live with one who was overly excited to see this adaptation of a Chinese trilogy of books. As you can imagine, I was less than eager. I do understand from readers of the books that this is a hard trilogy to depict on screen...which explains the heavy use of CGI and in more than just ""the game"".In the eight episodes that make up season one there are two timelines running...one contemporary and one in the 1960's China under Chairman Mao's regime. In fact that is where the story starts (a deviation from the timeline of the original books), with the public beating and death of a physics teacher with his daughter in witness. His daughter ends up in a lumber work camp...and eventually is brought to a remote research center that is trying to communicate with an alien race who eventually answers back thanks to her disobeying a direct order. The real question becomes did she doom the human race thanks to that one decision?Meanwhile in contemporary times science is no longer making sense and a whole series of scientists appear to be killing themselves. There is a group investigating all of this, there are shiny helmets that seem to have advanced technology and involve playing a game, there is a countdown, the stars wink...there is a floating ark with a group who seem to believe the aliens are our saviors in a religious fanatic kind of way...and then there is the most unbelievable part of the whole story: five friends in the U. K. seem to be the smartest minds in the world and seem to have all of these events happening to and around them?!?!?!I don't want to get in to the science or lack-there-of, because I am an applied scientist not a theoretical one and while complex theories are mentioned or talked around...they are never explained in detail.I enjoyed Liam Cunningham's character Thomas Wade tremendously. I think he and his interactions are some of the best in the series. I enjoyed the comedy (intentional or not) between him and actor Benedict Wong who plays his underling Da Shi. The friends for the most part I found super annoying and most unbelievable as theoretical (or otherwise) physicists! There was the weirdest vibe between Auggie Salazar and Jin Cheng...and if the fate of the human race is in the pot smoking ambitious-less Saul Durand hands, we are in so much trouble. Although I am enjoying the ""I refuse"" and no one believing...great comedy.Marlo Kelly plays a great villainous character in Tatiana. She has creepy down to perfection. I enjoyed the concept of not trusting someone who admits to having told a lie...and the bug analogy, seemed at the time like there were better analogies that could have been made, but it ends up working in to the story so perfectly with ""the message"" and then Da Shi's pep talk. So, in the end I enjoyed it. The Panama Canal scene...while overly CGI'd was interesting. I am also really enjoying Saamer Usmani who plays Raj Varma, he is amazing. I think the character of Jin Cheng needs to wake up and smell the coffee and realize how good she has it with Raj...because frankly he could do better.The show was ok, but kind of middle of the road for a sci-fi series. Didn't make me want to read the book or watch more necessarily...especially since I didn't really find anyone to root for in this depiction.",IMDB,"Brains in space, winking stars and aliens who think we are bugs.",5.0
"I will admit that episode one made me believe that this series was going somewhere. The series took off in China during the Cultural Revolution, with a daughter of a murdered physicist making contact with some kind of entity in outer space...A few episodes in and we have computer games, invisible aliens, pointless dialogues, sub-plots, suicides, a random cult, cancer, nanotech that can slice a boat up in Panama and an AI alien who has communicated with a rich guy on a boat since like 30 years back, but decides to abandon all the cult-members because they did not like the story of ""Little Red Riding Hood"".This, as well as a hundred plot holes with the writers seemingly not understanding basic concepts in quantum physics (or even trying to explain it in any logical sense for the sake of the story).To add to the mystery of this terrible and rushed script:
The chief (Liam Cunningham) of the MI6 seems to be in charge of all security of the world (and seemingly is the only one working at MI6). He also controls the Navy and all the space programs... The only other person with influence working at the London Police is one detective (Benedict Wong). He has no superiors or colleagues, except for that one guy who works for MI6....And I haven't even presented the major characters yet... We have about five (I honestly don't care how many) brilliant physicists, that all happens to be best friends and of all ethnic backgrounds. None of them seems to know anything about physics, and three of them really doesn't have much to add to the story at all.One of the main characters, Auggie Salazar (Eiza González) is probably the least convincing nanotech mastermind I could possibly have envisioned... The other main character, Jin Cheng (Jess Hong) is just another physicist character. I do however feel that Hong is the most convincing to actually ever have set foot in a University, and her acting is alright.To sum up: if you want to have something play in the background as you scroll on your phone or to rest your eyes on after a weekend of partying, this could be it. But, don't expect the story to actually try to explain all the different things going on, or the writers of it to actually have cared to explain anything further than ""aliens"".",IMDB,poorly written sci-fi flick,3.0
"I really struggled to get through this tv serious. It does have its moments and at times intriguing, but way too much wishy washy unnecessary fluff for me, rather than moving on with the main story, or even telling it with any depth of detail.Like others have already mentioned, one big problem also is that the characters are just flat without any charisma. Making the show quite bland IMO.And because the story when told, is missing so much in-depth information, you can't help thinking are these major plot holes, when considering the number of light years away the invaders are.If you like Syfy shows like Apple's Invasion, Prime's Hanna, then you are probably going to like it.

"I have not read the novels, so this review comes from watching the series with no foreknowledge or expectations beyond hoping for a good show.And, maybe 1.5 episodes in I realize that I'm just... bored. Things are happening, from a random suicide, some graphics about weird particle flights from an accelerator that are apparently wrong and a 'winking' night sky.... but nothing makes any sense and there's no sense of tension or character development. I decide to cut my losses because my instincts are telling me that this will be all form, no substance that is going to make me frustrated.I couldn't quite put my finger on what bothered me and thought that perhaps the novels just aren't for me.And then I saw that the Chinese version was available on Amazon. I watched just the first episode of the Chinese (Tencent) version and I was spellbound. The language is almost always Mandarin and the subtitles can come pretty quickly at first. But, I was completely drawn in. There may be some fancy special effects in later episodes but I will take plot and character and tension any day over ""Wow! Look what I can do with CGI and Chat GPT!""The Tencent version has tension and character development. The scientist suicides are presented and clearly communicated as an international crisis and it's compelling and feels like a completely different story.I was finally able to figure out what was so wrong with the Netflix adaptation. It violates the fundamental rule of writing: ""Show. Don't tell"". The Netflix version is constantly telling us what's happening and telling us that something must be important... but it doesn't show why. It doesn't convey the story as anything but some kind of paint-by-numbers multimillion dollar special effects extravaganza.If they had spent a fraction of the money and just dubbed the Tencent version it would be 100X better for 1,000X less money.",IMDB,All dazzle... no substance,3.0

First episode I accepted would be more of an introduction to get to know the players, which it was. But the second episode was just as slow and one didn't know what the story was really going to be about. As I like a good sci fi show, the bits that were uncovered were real quantum stuff and not a lot of nonsense. Alas the show was spoiled by too much talking and too much irrelevant other happenings to fill an episode. I started losing interest by episode five but continued binge watching. Eventually we learnt of the true nature of this story and I was keen to see what the threat looked like, but for that we have to wait for season 2.

But even when compared to the Chinese version, it falls short in terms of storytelling, pacing, character development, narrative comprehension, and thematic focus. There are numerous instances where not only does it fail to respect the principles of the novel, but it also muddles even the most basic of logic.Can someone explain to me why we have characters like Auggie Salazar, Will Downing, Saul Durand, Jack Rooney and Raj Varma?

"Having delved into both Cixin Liu's original Chinese trilogy and the Tencent/My ThreeBody/animated Three-Body adaptation, I find the Netflix version to be disappointingly substandard. It appears to prioritize profit, stereotypes, and ideology over the authenticity of the sci-fi epic. It may be the poorest Three-Body adaptation I've ever seen. I personally believe that the screenwriters owe an apology to Cixin Liu.Initially, my friends and I were captivated by the series, but the substantial alterations eventually led us to decide to stop watching.

The writers believed that women could only express their appreciation for talented men by getting laid and having sex, but in the context of the time, women were far from being liberated to such an extent.

The female lead's intelligence, which is important in the drama, is portrayed like a monkey who can only distinguish between right and wrong.

"As a fan of Liu Cixin's renowned science fiction novel ""The Three-Body Problem,"" I was eager to delve into the recently adapted series that promised to bring this complex tale to life. However, what I encountered was a disappointing departure from the core essence of the characters and themes.One of the most striking misinterpretations was the portrayal of the main character's disillusionment with humanity. In the novel, her despair stems from profound philosophical and existential questions about the nature of civilization and morality. Yet, in the series, this was overshadowed by a focus on her romantic relationships, reducing her struggles to superficial romantic entanglements.The title ""The Three-Body Problem"" alludes to a complex astrophysical phenomenon, symbolizing the intricate challenges faced by civilizations. However, the adaptation reduced this to a literal interpretation of ""three human bodies"".Another letdown was the subpar special effects, especially considering the reported budget of 20 million. The visual portrayal of advanced civilizations and scientific concepts fell short, failing to immerse viewers in the awe-inspiring world envisioned by Liu Cixin.Furthermore, the series seemed to reflect a limited understanding of cultural and historical contexts. The emphasis on Western perspectives and a reductionist view of human emotions undermined the depth and universality of the story, highlighting a lack of cultural nuance.",IMDB,A Misguided Adaptation,2.0

And even more ridiculous that the show spends lots of time around meaningless romantic tangles among the friend group, which doesn't help in either storyline progressing or showing the complexity of human nature. This is not a sitcom or romcom like Friends or How I Met Your Mother, it doesn't really matter who Saul is sleeping with or whether Jin loves Will.Another thing that fascinated me in the novel is how it reveals the three-sun chaotic environment of San-Ti planet by showing the history of how human understand the universe and physics (a lot of real historical figures like ancient Chinese & European philosophers and physicists) and proves that the physic theories on earth can't be applied to San-Ti and can't help San-Ti solve their problem, therefore the only option for them is to find another habitat, earth! But again this part is fast forward in the show.It seems that the show doesn't have the patience to show the complexity of human nature and the detailed physic science as written in the book, it just wants to fill all the eye-catching special effects into a sci-fi story plus some boring romance and love stories.",IMDB,Disappointing adaption from a great novel,5.0

"I give my score to the books that are the source of the good ideas in the series. I would give a zero to two guys who learned nothing from their mistakes on Game of Thrones.The source material has such good ideas that even the fact that it is based on it takes the series to a certain level. But really, the producers and scriptwriters of the series are so incompetent. First of all, the book has a very broad vision in its treatment of events. Such source material, such a budget, yet the vision of the series, the character pool, and the handling of events are so narrow. You narrow down planet-wide events by making everyone each other's friends, lovers, and acquaintances. Because your vision is not enough to create a broad fiction. Secondly, as in many productions, the creators of this series change the source material aimlessly and clumsily according to their wishes. You only adding a scene about women's rights, including non-existent romantic relationships, and adding a dialogue saluting same-gender couples (all classic Netflix) for populism and do not contribute to the main material. But these are not the ones I'm talking about, every other change you make only shortens and diminishes the world building and science fiction basis of the main material. You waste the resources of the series with unnecessary dramas of a group of friends that are not in the original material, and you fail to even tie it together.As the book series progresses, it tells stories with larger and broader visions.

"A hyped up production with lots of buzz for its bizarre plot pieces. A cast of international characters thrown together to confront a conspiracy (that goes right to the toppy tops of the very universe) facing a mystical and mysterious force (which has its own human allies). Somehow loosely held together by contrived sci-fi concepts, the plot never resolves any of its multitude of conflicts, arcs or questions. And as befits any streaming series (and ""Lost"" exploited, I mean truly ""exploited"" to the limit), it is drawn out with melodramatic soap opera scenes of exaggerated angst and empty pathos. But the characters are not as crisp and charismatic as Lost, the production values not as rich, and the direction not as dynamic. And those drawn into its convoluted mystery looking for an elegant resolution have probably forgotten by now how Lost concluded.",IMDB,"Off-brand version of ""Lost""",4.0
"This is an adaption of a three-part sci-fi novel series, written by a Chinese author. This movie is projected to be the first of three or four, covering the entire trilogy.The generous budget and some of the science made it interesting, as well as the story line in the novels.My main problems with this adaptation are the insistence of the show creators to insert unnecessary romantic entanglements between several of the young scientists who are the protagonists. Completely unnecessary and off-putting. Gave the show a ""Friends meets Big Bang Theory"" element that took away from the original story.In addition, all the scientists are unrealistically cast. They are all under 30, yet they are supposed to have spent a decade-plus earning multiple, advanced science degrees. Pretty faces over-emoting, to amp up the social drama, instead of just telling the great story in the trilogy.One part that made me laugh at the TV was when the young, idealistic nanotechnology ""genius"" violates all her funding agreements, decides to open-source her tech and destroy any chance of the financial backers from developing real-world applications. In real life, this could be considered a criminal offense that would result in her bankruptcy. In the movie, nothing happens to her and she decides to travel the world, making water treatment filters.Then it shows her in a third world Central/South American country, ridiculously screwing on a nano-filter cartridge to a village's water pump.As a chemical engineer who understands water filtration, this was a comical fail.First of all, the pressure drop across the filter would be strong enough to prohibit hand pumping. It would require an large, electric motor/pump assembly, just to produce any output.Secondly, the more a filter catches, the faster it plugs. This filter wouldn't last more than an hour or two (at best). After an hour, it would need replacement. The used filter would be unrecyclable garbage.This water filtration exercise would be prohibitively expensive and would require electrical supply installation/upgrades at every application.The scientific illiteracy is mind-boggling, just for that one tiny example.I won't even get into the 300 nukes in space issue. Completely impossible to achieve. Oh, and the suspended animation technology? How many decades are we into the future?Completely unrealistic.",IMDB,Bad Adaptation of Good Sci-Fi Story,4.0
"This is like a french fries and hotdog pizza I saw the other day. Brainstorming until the creators brains overheated.Many disconnected ideas with no point, no tension, no dynamics, no resolution. Dumb and Dumber just got lucky to stumble upon JRR Martin's material. Because from the last season of GOT and this show, you can tell they are good on the superficial aspects of video production, but terrible in terms of depth in transcendental ideas and the essence of form in Art.The show is pretentious and paints itself smarter, deeper, and more meaningful than any of the people involved had the ability to grasp.I can't tell what this show is about, but I can tell you what it is NOT about: a plausible interaction with aliens, a strange videogame with philosophical implications, communism and science versus religion, how astronomy supposedly beats iChing, how everything is possibly a simulation Matrix style, or how people who have nothing in common end up being best friends. This series is a failed attempt at mixing all these random ideas in a rather contradictory and prosaic manner. Not to mention the low level of comedy achieved.Good acting from the Chinese cast, except the Australian one who plays the game.",IMDB,Misses the point,4.0
"We started out really liking the premise and intrigue even though at first the show seemed like a Recycler at times, but the intrigue kept building for a few episodes and of course the cast was more than just a magnet for viewers, from Jonathan Pryce and Rosalind Chao to Benedict Wong and John Bradley. Sighh, unfortunately the premise is mired in some major plot flaws and by the end of the first season, with the finale, we find 3 Body Problem has some serious story telling problems, specific to the science fiction genre. Clearly many of you found it incredibly good and we invite you to challenge our full-blown review which identifies specific and major structural issues with this series. Be warned this is NOT The Expanse nor anything of the quality of that show. West Coast Midnight Run's editors felt the viewer could either be turned off at first or pulled in depending on your experience with science fiction tropes, movies and shows.

"There is a stark difference between science fiction and the advanced technology often portrayed that could be considered a plausible progression/outcome of the scientific method and the often implausible, utterly ridiculous scenarios that have become normalised in mainstream film, epitomized by films like the ""Fast and the furious"", and its sequels, the ""Fasterer and even more Furiouser Pt 42.5. Why would you waste your time watching such guff is beyond me. Twenty years ago, they were made for afternoon viewing by adolescents after school.Others have covered the flaws from a cinematic point of view far better than I am capable. I will restrict my comments on the cold-blooded pre-meditated murder of science as a lay person; that makes it even worse.If the premise of exploding nuclear weapons as a method of achieving the intended ends, isn't enough to make your head explode, the method they are employing contradicts Einstein's theory of relativity. Increasing velocity increases mass and pressure no matter what medium the object is passing through, which requires a vehicle made from hardened metals to begin with, and as the velocity increases, so does the weight and pressure upon the object, making it impossible to come close to travelling at 30,000km per second. As well as the weight increases, the impact of the nuclear explosion has less and less impact.There are endless articles online written for the layperson on the relationship between speed and massIt's one thing to speculate on future tech advances, but offer up solutions that fly in the face of E=MC2 that everyone has heard of, whether they understand it or not.To time explosions to go off at precisely the right nanosecond to aid a vehicle travelling at such velocities?One thing the series got right was that we now live in a fantasy world of miracles, and anything goes.",IMDB,Shocker,2.0
"Honestly, this is the best Netflix can do with $200 million? I could have done better with the chimp in Episode 7 on my phone using an AI generator and a drawing of Curious George. Was so excited for this after reading the books and watching the Tencent version (which, btw, comes close to bettering the ""big"" scene with the Judgement Day ship and I am sure cost much, much less). My expectations started crumbling with the trailer featuring that ""jaw dropping"" and ""awe inspiring"" winking universe scene, which in the book could only be seen through a special headset but here just...blinks on and off, literally (hide mask show mask hide mask show mask that'll be $250,000 thank you). Other than Benedict Wong, casting was almost completely off, and don't get me started on Elza Gonzalez as ""Dr."" Salazar. The series butches through the first book, makes major headway into the second, and the showrunners want 4 seasons? To do what?

"So the aliens are horribly written. They have immense powers. Stupidly immense. They can render any technology useless. They can make you go mad and kill yourself. They can make the world seem as if inception has become reality. They can somehow help make would-be assassins for their cause invisible to our perceptions and to our technologies. And I'm assuming much more.And most of this came to a climax in the middle of the series when they made every screen on Earth tell us we are nothing but bugs, made everyone freak out with a giant ass eye in the sky.And then carried on like none of that happened. Biggest plot hole in an otherwise slightly compelling story. Can't get past the aliens. Like they could just end any life they wanted to easy.

We have theories today that could explain such a thing..but nope, everyone just starts killing themselves because they are too rigid to open their minds up to new possibilites.It also kinda reminds me of this show where THe main character was arguing about God is Nowhere and God is now here.

"Spoilers ahead (for this and other recent movies/shows).I just finished this. I read the 1st book in the series and was very intrigued by the premise.It started out okay, with the scenes in China. All downhill from there.It makes absolutely no sense if you have enemies who know every single thing you're doing and can control seemingly everything. Why would
they let us get as far as they did? Why keep us alive? How did they not know humans lie right from the beginning? How did everything get built so fast? What the heck would happen to Will's brain? Why was Saul chosen?But all this is secondary to the lack of a resolution. I'm sick and tired of movies and series ending ambiguously, either because there could be a season 2 which may never come (see Constellation); or even if there most likely will be a sequel so they have to make sure you'll come back (see Dune Part 2); or because the director says, ""It's up to you to decide what the ending means"" (see American Fiction or All of Us Strangers.)

The premise is intriguing but from there goes downhill faster than Game of thrones from season 6 to 8.The suspense is revealed very early on and after that it is like independence day/ Armageddon or any other 90s alien invasion movie you can think of.The supposedly greatest scientist characters are so unnatural that it is painful to watch. Same with one British cop who is calling the shots on everything about a war that is more than global.Even the aliens are pretty naive.

"First, it should be noted that while Benioff and DB did a great job on Game of Thrones before they ran out of source materials (and ran away), whatever afterward was full of controversy. And this is exactly what's happening here.The change of the stage from China to the UK is more than geological, but also cultural, and therefore the narrative, PoV, motivation of characters' actions, and the way they think. This is essentially an overhaul of the entire story arc, the development of individual characters, and how different character storylines converge.Unfortunately, Benioff and DB are not known for being good at this, especially when they replaced nearly all major iconic Asian characters (Wang Miao, Luo Ji, etc.) from the show, more than 90% of them being British/American and over half of them being white, essentially cut off the Asian culture implication from the show without a sound enough alternative.Such a disappointment that they respect neither the source material nor the Asian audience.

"It's one of those shows that kept me watching until the last episode in the hopes that it gets better (somehow) or otherwise see how much worse it can get. Script and casting were the major fails here. The dialogues made an already ridiculous premise insufferable. Cringe-fest! Eye-rolls to the idea that a group of friends - all very, very young - were somehow the only ones qualified to save humanity from an alien invasion. Eiza Gonzalez was the most unconvincing Auggie (forever dolled up as if about to hit the runway) who was in turn the most unconvincing nanotech innovator. Actor Jess Hong as Jin had potential, but didn't quite get there. Saul was underutilised as a character - until suddenly propelled forward as one of the chosen ones, and for no apparent reason. Alex Sharpe is obviously talented but brought in a pathos and melancholy that seemed rather misplaced next to characters busy cooking up quick calculations and theorems to wage war with aliens as if they were in a YA fictional world. Benedict Wong was probably the only one who pulled off the character of a wry, world-weary detective/ security/body guard (it was never clear what his role was), so I hope he gets a shot at a better show/film in the future.

Didn't really work out what was going on because I was so disgusted and repelled by all the smoking. For god's sake, I thought they had gotten rid of the repulsive cancer sticks from shows.

It just makes no sense - the single most significant set of scientific readings ever recorded, and they shut down the science? It would be all anyone was taking about, everywhere, because we'd all be expecting the universe to come to a catastrophic end at any moment.I don't mind a bit of poetic licence in my Sci-fi.

The male characters isn't that much better, but at least they seem to have some emotions and ounce of personality.People who've read the book claim that the show is rushed and i can totally see that.

"My main impression of the Tencent series from 2023 was that it was too slow in a certain part in the middle, while the rest was appropriately paced, so I was hoping that and only that was what Netflix were going to cut down to keep only the good parts. Instead, Netflix did a really strange teen-brained speedrun style of adaptation where even the ""good parts"" are being rushed through like someone's trying to get this thing done as fast as possible to move on to the next project. It's almost like they're intentionally making a mockery of this whole thing, with no time to build appropriate suspense about world-changing discoveries, no time to build deep characters worth caring about, no realism to the science-talk. Ironically I think even the live-action/full-realism presentation of the 3D game is detracting from the impression that part should be making, whereas the lower-grade more early-2000s 3D renderings in the Chinese version seemed the correct way to do that.As noted by others, the casting is pretty bad and the dialogues are edgy and un-dramatic, which absolutely ruins a story about world-shattering and mindblowing events. And it's not just the young ""scientists"" looking like fashion models and talking like videogame-playing teenagers (Jess Hong is actually one of the better actors here, just not given a lot of mature script to work with), but also older figures I would've expected far far more from (I'm looking at you Benedict Wong, what a disgrace of a performance). The detective and the nanotech scientist in the Chinese version were sooo much more likable characters it's actually shocking to see the difference. (Nice trick, casting ""Ser Davos Seaworth"", as well as ""Samwell Tarly"", as well as ""The High Sparrow"" from Game of Thrones, to get us to like this show, but not good enough - they didn't save your last show from your bad writing D&D, and they didn't save this one.)I don't know if I even need to subject myself to any more of this after 4 episodes, it's plowing through everything so fast I'm afraid there might be spoilers already in the first season compared to what I've seen in the Chinese one.

I appreciated the performance from Benedict Wong, Jonathan Pryce, John Bradley, Jess Hong, Jovan Adepo, Marlo Kelly, and Ade Edmonson too. But I don't think some of the others were up to par. Liam Cunningham I like but even there something seemed a bit 2D about his character, but again that is possibly just the fault of the subpar writing. Eiza Gonzales I felt was not convincing at all, she just seems like she should be playing a model, not a physicist, sorry.It felt to me like an episode of doctor who just stretched over 8 episodes that became boring fast.

This is neither, it has no clue what it wants to be or is supposed to be. I mean, VR with an ugly helmet that is supposed to indicate advanced alien tech. This really hurts my head. I figure some people that don't know anything about science and tech will probably just bypass any understanding and chalk it up sci-fi. But anyone that gets tech and science will most likely just give this a pass. I've made this suggestion before, if you're going to write about any science that we currently know and understand, you better get someone to explain this to you and fact check your writing first.

"The thing here is that if you've watched the original Chinese adaption of the book Three body then you will be left wanting by this version.It's much quicker paced but at the cost of so many details that are really supposed to be in there to make it truly good.Sadly 95% of the people will never know what they are missing and I guess for them this might still seem like a good show. I can only imagine what they would have thought about it if they knew better.If the reviewers could compare it to the Chinese version like me, this one would not currently have the same rating as the original. Because it simply does not deserve a similar rating.It gets the message across but it hurts to see it done in such a rudimentary way.",IMDB,So much was left out,4.0
"Having read the book and seen last year's ""Three Body"" I have to say I am extremely disappointed in 3 Body Problem. It took 30 episodes for Three Body to properly tell this very complex and sprawling epic and it only encompassed the first of the 3 novels. 3BP covers the first book in the first 5 episodes with the remaining 3 covering the first part of book 2. So what took Three Body 1350 minutes 3BP did in about 250 minutes. By condensing the material so drastically there's absolutely zero character development and so much of what makes this story so compelling is completely missing. Benioff and Weiss' ""americanizing"" steals the heart and soul of the story. I was amazed at how faithfully Three Body was to the original material. They said that 3 Body Problem couldn't be made but China proved emphatically that it could be, and could be made great. Season 2 is in production now in China and given that book 2 is almost twice as long as book 1 I assume it will be at least another 30 episodes if not more. I can't imagine how badly Benioff and Weiss will continue to butcher this material if they even get the green light for a second season. If you really want to see how great this story really is and want answers to all the questions you have from 3BP, do yourself a favor and watch ""Three Body"" streaming on Prime and Peacock.",IMDB,Doesn't tell the story!,4.0
"Awful, depressing, disturbing show with meaningless, senseless violence and suicide scenes.It's not entertaining at all, only upsetting just to shock the viewers, which is emotionally harmful in my opinion.If you are a parent, you really shouldn't let your children watch this without parental advisory (or maybe not at all) if you ask me. I'm fifty years old, but even I found myself depressed after trying to watch this show.And by the way, I wouldn't even call this show ""sci-fi"", I mean this isn't something sci-fi genre should be like... at all.

"The book is famously stupid and nonsensical. The show tried to fix a few of the most glarying plot-holes in the first episodes, but seemed to give up by episode 3 and just embrace the full stupidity of the book.This makes it hard to watch as anybody even moderately science literate. It might be a lot easier for science illiterate, but then again, my girlfriend starting asking me question expecting thatI as a book reader and scientist could answer, and all I could say was: There is no answer, the book and show just really is that dumb.

I was too shocked at the exaggeration portrayed of China to be able to enjoy anything. I've also read Western critics about this show and it seems the TV Show is filled with MESSAGES all over and not just about China.You know, when you start leaning about other cultures, you really start to see all the cracks, the narratives they try to force on us, and the entertainment becomes too stained to be able to hold the label ""entertainment""...Sad but hey what can you do, just zap to another channel.",IMDB,American propaganda at its finest,1.0
"Nowadays, most Sci-Fi movie/series are pretty stupid. The storyline of the 3 Body Problem holds pretty well, for the large part. However, I cannot bring myself to continue to watch it after E5 when the Royal Navy, under the command of a mysterious government official, destroyed an oil tanker with hundreds of people, including small children, on board. And that is that. After the killing, nobody seemed to give a damn about the people killed. Nobody showed any regrets or remorse.This is ethically corrupt and practically impossible. Practically speaking, the action is against the rule of engagement of any modern army, because none of the people on board were convicted criminals or carrying a death sentence or carrying weapons or an immediate threat to anybody. Second, there were children on the tanker, and it's not possible for any modern army (except for Israeli army) to kill everyone indifferently.It's ethically corrupt. In one of the interviews, the author of the original book showed his disregard for human life and his eagerness to sacrifice human lives for a grand goal. That mentality is inherited from the Lenin/Stalin/Mao era and pure social Darwinism.Yet, the producers had no problem adopting it and the main characters gave no regards to the innocent lives killed. The care for humanity is lost in the series and it became a pure game of survival at all costs.That's when I lost interest in this show altogether.",IMDB,The killing of the innocents killed the series for me,4.0
"This wasn't so much a sci fi movie as it was an emotional drama. I understand that the typical hero is more interesting if they are the reluctant hero that overcomes their fears but all these characters are just flogging themselves over their own moral judgement. There is some science behind the alien 3 body problem but it's actually a small part of the series that focuses mainly on the women being desperately sad while drinking with drugs. As far as I can tell, this is very much a Chinese epic of one middle earth kingdom against another kingdom with many characters coming directly from Chinese soap operas.

"3.9 ⭐
Pretty interesting start to the show but that quickly takes a turn towards the middle. I just cant wrap my head around how idiotic the series gets with the most questionable scenes using the smartest human beings on the planet and created by DB Weiss, David Benioff and others. Its like the GoT finale all over again...fail.Using nanofibers to destroy a ship or sending a human to meet aliens are a few examples of just how small minded these writers are. Youd think if you were writing a series you would do some research. Talk to the greatest minds out there and figure out some real world solutions instead of coming up with some kids way of making drama.Besides that the actors did fine, production value was there and cinematography on point.This show fell short...i wouldnt recommend watching this.",IMDB,Guess that huge contract with GoT showrunners didnt pan out lol,4.0
I had high expectations when i heard about this series. Sadly i got bored with every episode. I kept hoping for a climax but was left wondering what's going on. Some of the story line was more like a soap series. Very disappointed. Not my cup of tea. I did finish it but felt like i was cheated. The whole fuss that was made out of the series and me deliberately not wanting to find out about the novels had me thinking maybe it'll be something like the V miniseries where aliens try to take over and they'll be some type of war if the world. But seriously was left wandering what was going on and when i heard of the time frame of the aliens i was like.. yeah I'm out.,IMDB,Bored!,3.0
"If you are looking for a thriller tv show that you can casually watch without using a single brain cell during the process, or a something that can be used as a background music when doing chores.

No I'm not talking about the fact that they change all the timelines, or the character settings, I'm talking about the fact that it is not for any hardcore sci-fi fans.

"Overall I was intrigued and held captive by the story line. I was much more intrigued by the earlier episodes prior to grasping what was really happening. Once the story unwinds revealing some of the mysteries I started to loose a bit of interested and overall became very disappointed with what the plot was all about. I expected a much more mysterious, less cliche, and predictable explanation behind the mysteries. The end result was that the movie was retelling a story that has been told over and over many times in other SciFi movies. I was especially disappointed to discover what they were using the large dish antenna in China for. What a mundane purpose, as well as, basically something that has been going on within the world of astronomy for decades all over the world. It's not a secret, and really has no need to be such a secret. The movie builds up the mystery of what is going on at the secret site to such a high level that once you find out you actually become angry thinking ""oh God are you kidding me? Is that all they are trying to do? What else is new regarding mankind's search for other civilizations?"" The story introduced many mysteries occurrences and phenomena to build the mystery. Once you find out what the Chinese have been doing you then start to think about these strange occurrences. You end up asking yourself ""what did those things have to do with what they were attempting to do?"".I think the strongest deficits of the movie is something that has plagued many SciFi type movies, especially when a lot of action occurs. Basically this including actions/events that would not actually occurs in reality, or, the action/event would never be chosen as an option. Basically the characters utilize absurd methods to achieve fairly straightforward, and fairly easy to obtain, objectives. They basically engage in a lot of unnecessary ""overkill"" for the benefit of making the movie exciting, and/or unique. There is one point where the characters must achieve an important objective, which is to acquire an important device. Why trying to select a method of action to accomplish this objective they lay out several possible options. Each possible option is ruled out due to secondary consequence that would minimize success, or create more serious situations that no one on the team desires. So they must think outside the box to select a more unique, revolutionary approach utilizing the latest, untested technologies. When you discover what this approach is it confuses the mind because the obvious consequence of this approach is the same consequences they were trying to avoid in the first place when ruling out the more obvious choices. So they basically select a crazy, never tried, bizarre option that creates the same, or even worst, consequences of all the easier, proven, and straightforward options. Why? So they carry out this extravagant, risky, option, and it is visually stunning, and exciting, but the impact of doing so creates an impossible scenario which would make it extremely time consuming, and difficult to find, and acquire the desired device. The outcome was exactly what they wanted to avoid. But, despite the reality of this, the device is acquired quickly, with little, to no, effort. The script basically called for an impossible successful outcome that was completely out of the realm of reality, unless the real ""God"" performed a miracle, which resulted in the desired outcome. The approach, and resulting outcome, was so, so, absurd that it destroyed the whole feel, and believability of the movie. This sort of faulty script writing was present throughout the movie.The other aspects of the the story line that decreased the enjoyability of the movie was the inclusion of these very bizarre, mysterious, and unbelievable, fantasy like scenarios in which some of the characters are involved in. I can only describe these scenes using a very subjective adjective that I believe sums up the issue. Simply said these scenes were basically ""Corny"". They were sort of childlike inclusions that really, even following the series ending, were extremely confusing, distracting, and struggled to explain what it all really meant within the main story line. Actually, once the series completes, you realize that many of the outcomes observed, really don't make a lot of sense, or the explanation behind why they occurred is very weak, and diffuse.In closing, this movie had some entertainment value, but was overall a let down if you are a Sci Fi lover such as myself. For me, even though a Sci-Fi, by definition should include fictional scientific possibilities, and technology, it still should be explainable, and logical. Basically, despite its fictional nature, I must still buy into, and believe that, in some logical, and realistic sense what you observe in the movie should be possible, or, acceptable to some degree. If the movie cannot do this then I define the whole movie as ""unbelievable"". This concept does not only apply to the science aspect, but it also applies to the behaviors, thoughts, and actions of the characters. Therefore the characters actions, under given circumstances, must also be ""believable"". So, unfortunately, this series contained a lot of scenes, concepts, ideas, and behaviors that are just simply ""unbelievable"". This resulted in a sort of ""fantasy"" feel, where the existence of magic must be accepted, in order to believe, and grasp, what is being portrayed. This series is plagued with this feel throughout. I don't want to include any spoilers in this review, so I must warn you to not read any further, in case this next concept contains to much detail and is actually a spoiler. There is an alien theme to this movie. In the world of Sci Fi, we are all comfortable with accepting that if Aliens can make the trip to this world they are most likely very more advanced in many ways, as compared to us. This concept of being ""advanced"" can take on many forms, and concepts. It could include being technologically, biologically, spiritually, and evolutionarily, advanced compared to the human race. So I can accept a Sci Fi movie which demonstrates this idea of being more advanced in many ""out of box"" methods, concepts, and ideas. I can provide a lot of allowances for how a movie writer chooses to communicate this advancement. Despite this allowance a writer can take this concept to an ""unbelievable"" extreme. I believe the ""writer(s)"" of this series has exceeded my personal allowances, but maybe, not other viewers allowances. For me, within this series, the advancement demonstrated by the aliens borders on being ""god like"". It is obvious that the writers purposely wanted to create this idea. This is supported by the aliens being referred to as ""our lord"". A very suitable reference. Unfortunately, regarding my subjective taste, I do not respond well to ""aliens"" within Sci Fi shows demonstrating this level of boundless power and ability. The aliens in this series actually demonstrate an ""omnipresent"" quality and unless it is intended to be a sort of spiritual/religious theme I cannot go along.",IMDB,"Show has its highs and lows regarding overall quality, but missed the mark.",5.0
"From what I've read about the books this series is dramatically dumbed down from what was a great series of books, with a lot of fascinating science. This show ended up with a lot of hocus pocus and a lot of bizarre Ness for it's own sake, that did not really work, and implausibility and silliness. Some of the characters bordered on comical, though admittedly it was nothing as atrocious as a Marvel series.It could have been great the concept was good the costumes were great but it seemed like the director and the writer just didn't have the gravitas to pull it off.Alpha Centauri is indeed a triple system, which has two bright stars, Alpha Centauri A and B, and a tiny star, Proxima Centauri, which is closest to us (at 1.3 parsecs away) . In fact, it was not clear for a long time if the third star, Proxima, was bound to the system - because it's very, very far away, really at the limit of the system. The gravitational interaction of Proxima on the two main stars is extremely small. So what they've shown in the show - you have all this instability due to the third body - in reality, it doesn't happen in this system. Good try guys.",IMDB,Could have been great. It wasn't.,5.0

It's as if they forgot about LGBTQ+ characters, or assumed they could be inserted later.The lack of clarity about the aliens and the human betrayal is frustrating. It feels like the creators themselves are unsure of what they want to convey. The hype surrounding the show isn't justified; even the first season of 'Heist' was more engaging.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even fans of sci-fi.

Maybe the adapters are trying to pack in too many 'modern-day' parallels to political crises we're currently enduring. Perhaps another 'non-adaptable' book? In this case, yes.

"I love good Syfi that requires one to pay attention and not settle for cheap special effects and cheap scares. But this show, and the books, try way too hard to be cerebral. There is no real payoff in earth's confrontation with the alien species. Just have to wait for 4 hundred years to see that happen. It's not really the television series fault for that as it's based on a series of novels written by a real physicist and rocket scientist. I guess if you are one of those it will help to understand and enjoy this series. I'd rather settle for less nerd speak and more shields to maximum and ready the proton torpedoes. If they make a sequel to this series based on the second novel, expect more of the same but it does offer a answer to the question of if someone else is out in the universe, where are they ? God forbid if they do a series on the third novel as that one is full on geek speak.",IMDB,Pass,3.0
Read the books earlier this year and loved them. So was expecting great tv but sadly let down. It's not bad but it's all rather boring. The casting of the non Chinese actors is a mixed bag. Liam Cunningham did good job with the script given. The creators of the show didn't respect or trust the audience's intelligence and resulted in giving us a rather blend show. Shame cause this should have been epic.Visuals are great and loved the VR world settings. Biggest flaw is poor dialogue and bad casting on some characters. Also some of the choices they made they are different from books are poor. Shame.,IMDB,Average SciFi,4.0
"The Chinese original one was immensely better than this awful blob. Unwatchable and poorly designed. I regret of having lost some hours of my life in this way. I have countless better things to do including staring at the wall. If you liked this abomination please don't read the books! Everything in this show is like a fast food style cliché teen drama, a very very very low quality adaptation and production. I am so disappointed. It is so unbelievably bad and chaotic and fast forwarded that I don't have the right words to explain it. Terrible! Unfaithful! Messy! Save your time, it is precious.",IMDB,An awful blob,1.0
"I was excited to see what D&D would do with their new series. It started slow, then the characters and the story drew me in. I enjoyed seeing familiar actors from Game of Thrones. The Sparrow was back as another religious leader. There were shocking deaths of main characters, just like in Game of Thrones. I was thinking, Dave & Dan were doing a great job because they had a complete story to work with this time. But then it fell apart. What was with the crazy plan to send a brain into space? What was the purpose? I didn't understand how the Earth would benefit. It's not like the brain would be talking back to us on Earth. How would we know any more about the enemy? And how did the aliens send the virtual reality headsets to Earth? I don't think the people on Earth could manufacture them, could they? The aliens certainly wouldn't give people on Earth advanced technology. Their whole plan was to stop us from advancing.I was the most disappointed with the last episode. Yes bugs are resilient, but I needed something more. At the end of season one, our scientist friends were either dead or burnt out. I felt sad that Will's brain was trapped floating in space forever. I'm left to root for Saul, the pot smoking reluctant ""Wallfacer"" as Earth's best hope. I understand now that this season was just a setup for next season, but I needed something more to keep me going. At the end of Game of Thrones season 1, they had the image of Daenerys Targaryen surviving the flames with her dragons hatching. That kept me going! In 3 Body Problem we just have an image of swarms of bugs flying. I will say I hope someone finds Will's brain!!! That really bugs me that he's just floating out there. I'm thinking this could be a 400 year series before something happens. I was left curious what would happen next, but the reality is that it could take 2 years before season 2 and it may never get renewed. I don't want to have to freeze my brain to wait until the next season drops. It may never drop and then I might just remain a frozen monkey forever....",IMDB,1 Season Problem,5.0
"After watching the whole show almost in one sitting I have realized two things: 1. I don't think I understand what is going on at all, I feel too dumb for this show; and 2. There are so many loose ends in the season one finale that I feel like they did nothing but tiptoe around any solution.The acting is good, the premise is super interesting and intriguing but 3 Body Problem relies so heavily on science and scientific talk that it lost me very soon. The show tries to entertain an abundance of plots at the same time which leaves little option to dive deeper into things and makes the actual narration slow - too slow to get properly invested in.",IMDB,Hmmm...

"I like the scifi design and ideas in this series. Scientifically and theoretically speaking, must say that the details have some science integrated in it, though some are not plausible. Trisolar system is a bold idea.However, the series failed to convince me, a Vietnamese spent a lot of time in the UK for my PhD. It's just to say, I am familiar with both Asian and Western culture, and I am a scientist myself. Benioff and his friend, failed me from the last season of Game of Thrones when their talent of creation and imagination had been tested. And like GoT, all the storyline was loosely connected, and it does not make much sense. They really try to push some obvious agenda, which interferes too brutally the movie experience.One thing annoys me a lot, that's what happened to Raj, an Indian born, very capable, hard-working, credible and loyal fellow (and suspiciously sound and look like Rishi). It makes me question a lot about the Western ideas of loyalty when it treated Raj really unfair. In the verge of extinction, I rather trust this Raj instead of some unfaithful, unstable and unreliable so-called scientist.",IMDB,"If you do not have much free time - don't.

The time chopping get annoying and yet also doesn't help answer any solid questions.

"So, I had hopes. I am a sci-fi fan and I am very good at suspending disbelief. I binged the entire series.The premise of the series is believable and sound.What is ridiculous are the characters and the never ending drama between the 4 main millennials, especially pouty and obnoxious Auggie. Terrible character.Given the cool premise about a pending alien invasion and a group of humans that is facilitating that invasion, why is the viewer subjected to literally a couple hours of relationship drama and relationship conflict? I don't care. No one cares. The characters are unlikeable and annoying.There were a couple episodes that I fast forwarded probably 50% of the episode because it was trite and contrived, irrelevant, uninteresting drama and conflict between people that are supposed to be the world's lead scientists?????? Please.It is a typical cheap, money saving, US film industry nonsense ploy to include the drama. The same type of dialogue and drama that destroys things like Star Trek Discovery, the Monarch Godzilla show, and many others being mass produced.When there is so much interesting going on with the premise of the show, why are we subjected to watching cheesy predictable relationship issues. The Game of Thrones people totally missed the mark on this one. Get back to dragons and white walkers instead. This was a disappointing bore.",IMDB,Not Good.

Just something new, you know?But well, I was wrong.As soon as the secret is out and we find out what is happening it got progressively more boring by the minute. I did not get the clever story I was excited for but a rather typical sci-fi story that I felt like I've seen a hundred times before.So in conclusion.. cool, mysterious beginning with a few things that SEEMED like it was leading to something clever and unique but turn out just MEH .. what a let down.",IMDB,Such a disappointment,3.0
"If they really wanted to do these episodes, they could have done their own original ones instead of ruining my favorite book.I just talk about one thing: why the characterization of Ye is so SIMPLE, FLAT, AND STEREOTYPED! A female scientist who was supposed to be rational appeared irritable, emotionally exposed, and unrestrained in TV drama. What is touching is that Ye has not given up the ability to love her lover despite all the blows, and she still hopes that human beings can get better. She wanted to light a bonfire of civilization, but in the end it got out of control. That's why I like her, and even though her mistakes lead humanity to hell, I still don't want to define her as a simple ""villain"". Especially Ye's two ""loves"" made out of nothing, I think it's really hard to comment. I won't go into it, after all, I have to respect different people's views on ""love"" and respect the ""species diversity"" of human beings, so those who love to watch it just enjoy it.TV drama can, of course, be creatively adapted from books. And I don't care what the actors look like or whatever it is, but if they can't figure out what the theme of the book is trying to say, don't piggyback on it.By the way, if you really like this TV drama, stick to your own ideas and leave me alone.

"Having just completed season 1, I must admit to feeling rather disappointed. The season finale, in particular, left much to be desired. The plot seems to be riddled with numerous loopholes, and the strategies employed to neutralize the enemy often come across as nonsensical. Despite being a fan of sci-fi, I found the overall narrative to be somewhat unfocused. The series veers from a setting reminiscent of the Shogun era to elements reminiscent of ""V"", then incorporates love-drama plots that feel more at home in shows like Eastenders, with a sprinkle of Love Island-esque romance. Ultimately, the season concludes with a sense of emptiness, failing to provide a satisfying resolution to the various story arcs.",IMDB,Nonsensical,5.0
"This could have been an amazing show. Considering the top producers behind (game of thrones, true blood). But ironically this sci-fi drama (at least the first season) misses exactly what the famous two other shows have: believable, captivating characters, deep personal stories, sharply written dialogue, instead, 3BP (to shorten it fashionably) feels too much like from a typical expected script book of ""how to make it a global mainstream franchise soon-to-be computer game product"". The artificially global cast (though all speak -very- British), the strange drama moral (showing us playing kids to kill them for thrill) and often illogical story arc. The frankly rather boring dialogues. It just feels too hastily produced without taking time for scriptwriting and drafting characters and scenes.",IMDB,Original idea but poorly executed,4.0
"I read the books 2 years ago and was excited to hear it had been adapted for Netflix.I was so in awe at the scope and conceptual depth of the books that I felt this was going to be a tough conversion to screen, sadly I was correct.If you haven't read the books, watch this series, it isn't a fail. But if you like it... please go and read the books as they offer so much more!Minor spoilers below...For anyone who has read the books, to enjoy this series you need to accept this is a sped up, character focussed plot with less high level emphasis. The scienctific explanations, the societal impacts and the slow burn reveals annd loop backs are not present.The opening scene depicting the death of Ye Wenjie's father in the Chinese cultural revolution is faithfully replicated from the book and her character is almost identical, as is Da Shi (Clarence Shi). The other characters are amalgamated or separated into new characters for screenplay convenience and they aren't bad, but it's not the same.I don't mind the westernised perspective, it doesn't really alter the core concepts of the book, but it all felt a little rushed with characters and relationships taking prominence over higher level concepts such as the ETO / UN / PDC. The human computer which was beautifully conceived in the books was glossed over to set up a nice sfx scene when the gravity of three stars ends the simulation. The same with the unfolding of a proton which in the book reveals an unfathomable conscious entity (the eye) that scares the Trisolarians so much they effectively destroy the universe it emerged from to protect themselves.For me this is the disappointment, it feels watered down and I suspect others who loved the books will feel the same.

"I started watching it without any knowledge of the book it's based on or how different the book and show are.The good thing about the show.The idea and concept is brilliant, it's unique, quite different from 100 others alien invasion stories. But yeah that's also why in trying to be too unique and smart it falters on it's own premise.The first five episodes are brilliant, the build up is fascinating and you are hooked up to see how everything unfolds, but the final 3 epsidoes are so dud, dull and boring and also stupid, that the thrill and excitement of first 5 episodes vanish and you also begin to see the loopholes and stupidity of the first 5 episodes.There are dozens of things that go unexplained, or missed or are loopholes in the script, but they are never answered, maybe they'll be cleared up in future seasons, I doubt it because there are no indications, but still hope that atleast some of them might be touched down in next season. I'm stating few of such issues below.It's made clear that SanTi aren't exactly evil, they are sort of clear, pure in thoughts alien race that's just trying to survive and thus they are coming to earth to coexist with humanity and not to conquer or wage war. They are a superior race in terms of technology and also civility, and thus would help humans solve basic issues and lead a better life on earth, both humans and SanTi.Now here's the issue with this.If SanTi are peaceful, why are they orchestrating with a fanatic human group to kill other humans.Or mentally torture several scientists with that clock and pushing them to either stop working or die(either by suicide or killed by their fanatic human group).SanTi have always been trying and planning to stop and destroy the human scientific advancement, that's why the whole clock thing and stars blinking thing. But through that game and in conversations with Evans, it was established that SanTi are just trying for the humans to understand about SanTi and learning about human from Evans. But then they snap as they learn humans lie and can't be trusted and thus decide to conquer earth rather than coexist. But weren't they planning this all along ? That's why they are trying to stop human advancement. So which one is it ? They're are peaceful and try to coexist and only change their plans when they learn humans can't be trusted OR they always planned on eliminating humans and conquer earth, thus lying about their true intentions. Which also contradict the fact that SanTi don't lie and are pure in thoughts.Let's assume, though it's never shown or explained, but let's assume SanTi has somehow provided the fanatic Evans group with the code and programming knowledge to develop such complex video game, and it's Evans group that gives the scientists that golden VR helmet game.Then who gives Tatiana the game in the finale episode ? Aren't Evans group all dead ? Even assuming some survived and fled, how did they get the VR game to Tatiana.Similarly there are atleast dozen other things that just happen without any explanation or reason, sometimes contradicting their own established facts.Now coming to the characters. I couldn't bring myself to like anyone apart from Wade and Clarence. All the scientists, especially Jin and Auggie are so annoying, their dialogues and behaviour are ridiculous. So much time spent on Will and oh god, every time he came on screen the clock moved slower, it was so slow and boring, all his scenes with Saul and Jack, OH I'M DYING, PITY ME, god just die soon please, all so that he can be sent to space as he's already dying. So much deadass slow boring scenes weren't needed to establish that Will can be sent to space. And it's obvious somehow his lost space probe will be picked up by SanTi in future seasons.I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe it gets better in future, with better writing and acting. For now, skip this one.",IMDB,Mediocre at best,5.0
"I haven't read the books and on watching this I'm in a quandary as to whether I would.It starts well, intense story, lots of intrigue into what is causing the scientists to kill themselves. Some interesting premises.This obscures just how dull and unlikeable the main characters are. All the physicists come across as smug, entitled whiners - and to be honest, aside from their appearances, they're pretty much indistinguishable.Once the initial ""reveal"" of the source of the problem is done, the whole thing crashes to a halt. Any mystery is replaced by more pouting and whining with most of the characters more interested in themselves than the ""crisis"" that threatens humanity.It then gets worse.People start matter-of-factly perfectly solving science problems (like stasis) as if they've waited until the last minute to do their homework. Earlier plot devices are abandoned more quickly than boxsets of the last season of GOT.Throw in some terrible CGI and more self-interest and the whole thing drags on seemingly indefinitely.Can't help but think that better actors and different show runners might have made a difference.",IMDB,Too many inert bodies,4.0
"Do you want interesting characters with conflicting arcs and unique points of view (like GoT?)? Not here. I didn´t really care for any character. This will sound cruel, but there´s a guy who´s dealing with cancer and I just wanted him to die, as his narrative was so uninteresting and depressing. I can relate to a story trying to convey the struggle of dealing with cancer, but this was just a guy I don´t care about, just dragging the show.Do you want great sci-fi? Not here. I don´t believe a single theory or idea they promote, it just doesn´t make sense and never get deep into one so I can say ""Ok, I can cheer for that"". Half of the season is about creating and idea (reaching the alien crafts) so stupid that they obviously fail when implemented. I was so annoyed at being right (the first time they say it I thought ""that´s just stupid"". Also I have never understood the level of alien intelligence other than creating 4K VR and good marketing while using screens to display ""you are bugs"". I may be stupid but the information was really sparse and I couldn´t grasp a correct characterization of what´s that civilization like, how is their society, and so on.Did you see crazy worlds in the trailer? That´s just in some episodes, the rest is just people in rooms talking nonsense. Relationships you don´t care about.

"One thing that strikes immediately is the originality of the plot. It's about an alien race whose planet has become unstable due to natural occurrences, and thus they need to move to a new planet where life flourishes. Aliens coming from a dying planet to conquer earth as a new home represents refreshing and staggering originality in the science fiction genre, and I can certainly understand why this author was awarded and lauded for this work. I certainly doubt that the award had anything to do with the lack of literary recognition for Chi-Com writers. The problem all started when a young female Chinese scientist goes to a communist facility and sends a signal into space that is received by aliens because naturally the communists want to spend millions to talk to aliens back in 1960s China. She gets a reply in a few years and is warned by some of the aliens not to send the signal again because their society will come to earth and conquer it. She's not happy with her life and blows off this warning, sending another signal. Anyway, these aliens are essentially insects who constitute a hive mind; again nonhuman aliens with a hive mind society are concepts that are totally new, never before having entered the human imagination. They want to pretend to like us but definitely don't have our best interest at heart, another totally fresh concept. And, can you believe it, some humans are completely fooled by this strategy and begin to worship these aliens as gods who will turn the earth into a utopia for us all, thus they will do anything for them legal or not. Something has to be done, and the best way to approach it is with a highly diverse group of brainy scientists with a heavy dose of THE MESSAGE. There is, of course, a diverse scientist in the group, and he's like the smartest among them. You can tell he's super smart because he wears glasses. And there happens to be a dark complected full figured woman filled with wisdom who holds a high position as the U. N. Secretary General. There's a lot of science talk and paint by the numbers personal drama. Finally, there's a lame ending to the story, so stop reading if you don't want to know. The aliens are coming to earth to make a new home and hide from more advanced aliens who might want to wipe them out; the dark forest hypothesis. The solution applied is to send signals out to even more advanced aliens letting them know that earth exists, thus spoiling the insect alien's ability to keep a conquered earth a secret. The aliens then divert their spaceships for greener pastures, but the stop gap measure eventually will likely doom humanity anyway. Fine, OK, great idea.",IMDB,Big Bang Theory without the comedy.,5.0

"Sadly, the screenplay unsuccessfully attempted to split the difference between a movie and a series. This had over 5 hours of unnecessary soap operatic filler material, just to call it a series.People complain that it did not follow the books. Just imagine how long ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" (870 pages) or ""Fellowship of the Ring"" (423 pages) movies would be if they had dutifully followed the books.3-Body is presented as a series because there is no ending and no payoff -- in hopes that a non-cliffhanger 8th episode would be sufficient to obtain a renewal order for a 2nd season. I vote NO!If people are going to write about science, they had better get it right, or at least close to a plausible theory. This 8+ hour movie is full of errors and holes -- beginning with the title. The story presents 3 suns and a planet = ""4 BODY PROBLEM."" Duh! Euler would be turning in his grave. In reality, the Alpha Centauri system -- 4 light years from Earth -- presents a 5 or 6 body problem:
A. Rigil Kentaurus with 0 planets;
B. Toliman with 1 candidate planet with possible moons
C. Proxima Centauri with 2 planets.It is remarkable how all movies depict aliens that seem to be limited to human psychological issues -- as if a far more evolved and technolgically advanced species would act just as violent, petty, arrogant, dictatorial, and selfish as humans. Thus, the human condition of self-destructuion pervades most unscientific alien fiction.NOT A SPOILER -- because this is not the actual story. A far better conclusion would be that the aliens were benevolent, and merely pretended to act malevolent, in order to give humans peace and unity by scaring the heck out of them and forcing all humans to overcome their differences by uniting to defeat an extraterrestrial foe which was never any real threat.",IMDB,Neither Movie nor Series,5.0

"Imagine all science fiction you have read , watched, or even ""theoretical"" physics.Every Alien film, Supernatural film, Fantasy e.g. Tolkien with the ever Gazing ""Eye...red...writhed in flame"".And take all the AI and technology that we have gotten lost into. Have a nihilistic philosophy, and mush it all together into a story, and the result will be 3 Body problem.I define the three body problem basically whether it is ET, Alien, or Predator + 1984/NSA conspiracy genre/and Intellectual Narcissism+ any AI, Futuristic VR= 3 Body Problem.It's frustrating that despite innovation in technology, robotics, and medicine that in terms of literature , entertainment, art, music we have been in stagnation for 40 years.I have theories as to why, but that's not relevant to the mediocrity of the genre, the only difference in the genre is how well it is written, the effects, pacing and the story line.Maybe the 18-35 demographic that never saw the original Twiligt Zone, read Asimov or Philip Dick, or the original Star treks, etc...but with few exceptions there is nothing new.So in science fiction I won't criticize people giving this show a 7 and up, but it was watchable caught my interest for 5/8 but as every minute passed by, when I can predict the general dialogue or direction. It's a hack job. The story has no imagination it's flat.",IMDB,Zero Originality,5.0

"THUMBS DOWN!I do not speak Chinese, so Netflix: YOU FAILED!Netflix, like some other streamers, has a lot of really awesome International TV, documentary, and movie content in different languages, some lip-synced, some sub-titled.I grew up with synching and MUCH prefer it over sub-titles, for good reasons.""3 Body Problem"" is BANISHED for me, because it is way too complex to sit through the chore of deciphering sub-titles.WHY did Netflix not sync it, when they sync seemingly better than half of the other stuff, including a Titanic-load of silly anime for pretending-to-be-grown-ups??Sub-titles make watching the scene difficult, and you do not get the original dialogue anyway, plus the dialogue has to be shortened to be able to keep up with reading, or it is simply a lousy translation done fast and cheap and is nowhere near the real content.This is why sub-titles SUCK, because while reading you miss visual clues and action, and the dialogue often is totally butchered. A GOOD synch solves all of that!This is a major production that deserves a respectful treatment, so give us the choice of a synchronised sound-track!Is that too much to ask, when you can do all kinds of cheap productions with excellent synch jobs? These el-cheapos prove it does not cost much to do an excellent sync. I am bilingual, and can improvise my way through a couple more languages, so I can tell, if the synch is good or bad. Netflix usually does really well, so why no synchronisation here?I BET this is synch'd in Germany, but I have no access to that stream. BUMMER!",IMDB,Seriously? A CHORE to watch without synch!,1.0
"Not only did the book suck, but so too does the series.The most convoluted and nonsense stuff happens.It really writes science from a perspective of not actually knowing science, so I don't understand why people love that aspect.It has some great scenes, done really well. Some interesting concepts, as with the books. But again, drops the ball with convoluted characters, poor understanding of science by thinking of itself smarter than what it is (the books were nauseating with this), and most annoyingly putting people forward as either smart or highly capable in their own right, then systematically making them act like a stupidest person to ever exist.Both wanting to paint 'intellectuals' as the best we have, but needing them to be drooling levels of dumb so that the plot can even continue in the first place.Benedict Wong is great. Honestly he was perfect casting, and nails my favourite character from the book at least. It's a Hollywood cast, and he is great.So too is Liam Cunningham. The two of them work really well, and are great when they come into their own.Side note, the Kiwi girl playing Jin Cheng mumbles so much, I'm so happy we have subtitles on.",IMDB,Faithful adaptation,2.0
"Character Composition: One of the themes of the book is Earth facing a scientifically unsustainable crisis, and people from different backgrounds and fields come together to find a solution. This includes military personnel, police like Da Shi, scientists like Luo Ji, and so on. In the TV adaptation, the writers understandably diversified the cast to appeal to Western audiences. However, the actual execution involved a group of people who already knew each other, which significantly weakened the story's credibility. The story only reflected UK localization, not internalization. Additionally, Da Shi, the policeman, should have played a significant role, as his character would have added to the story's appeal and sparked audience interest. However, in the series, his role was noticeably diminished.Character Development: The series fails to show the audience the characters' personal growth, making it difficult to understand the rationale behind their actions. The characters lack depth, and their complexity and growth are not evident. For example, Ye Wenjie, the central character, is motivated by her traumatic experiences to rebel. However, the TV adaptation portrays her character development as shallow and superficial.Plot: The plot is overly simplified and formulaic. For instance, the impact of the video game created by the ETO on the worldview and beliefs of human scientists is not adequately portrayed. The development feels rushed, as if the director and screenwriter were working on a college assignment with an impending deadline. They should have taken the time to understand the main characters in the story.Setting: The story is set in China, but the historical and monumental events Liu intends to convey are largely absent from the series. While setting the modern events in London may attract more Western viewers, it's questionable whether this achieves the desired effect. Regardless of the location, the story lacks a sense of historical depth and fails to reflect the problematic aspects of modern society, such as the Cultural Revolution, racism, and aggressive environmentalism. This lack of reflection turns the story into a mere soap opera.Plot Arrangement: The story follows clichés typical of Hollywood, with whitewashed characters and stereotypes. It's indeed ironic that in a story written by a Chinese author, the heroes who can save the world are replaced by British characters, while Chinese men are depicted in a negative light. Additionally, Asian women are depicted as needing to have sex with white men to receive help, perpetuating male fantasies. In 2024, audiences are tired of these clichés.For a show to be successful, it needs to be unique. The success of ""Three Body"" is owed to the author's imaginative thinking and reflections on the past and future. Unfortunately, this TV adaptation lacks such insights and is unlikely to become a classic in five years. Therefore, I give it a rating of 4/10.",IMDB,The Show Struggles to Preserve Cultural Integrity and Character Depth,4.0
"While watching it, I enjoyed it a lot, but it suffered from my pet hate so gets a one star from me... !!Ok there is apparently great source material, that I have not read or was even aware of. So have nothing to compare it to... but I guess there is a story the writers have to loosely stick to...why make an eight episode series that just stops!!!???The story meanders a bit at some points, so surely the writers could have tightened things up and got to an ending of some description even if it was a 'cliff hanger'. I paused episode eight and noticed 22mins to go, and thought to myself ""jeez they're going to have to wrap this up pretty fast, I hoping the ending isn't too rushed and spoils the whole thing...""But nope it just stops, no resolution to any of the story elements. I hate that. Maybe if season 2 (assuming there is one) wraps things up a bit then I will probably raise my rating.",IMDB,Pet hate,1.0
"The book won numerous awards yet for some reason Netflix felt the need to change many characters, split them and shuffle the story for more drama. The result is confusing and rainbow casted. Of all the decisions why is the future of the earth decided by people from the UK. Physics is centered at CERN and the US if not the book location China or Japan. The original was linear and relatively easy to follow. The Netflix adaption makes Lost seem simple.

"There are aspects of the ""3 Body Problem"" story that potentially make it quite bad. But I haven't decided if these aspects of the story are used to convey a deep theme about humanity's failings. For example, the solution Thomas Wade comes up with to get the hard drive storing recordings of conversations with the aliens. That is the dumbest solution ever: slice the ship up killing everyone on board! Could they not just wait for them to resupply at a port and then get a search warrant. But maybe ""3 Body Problem"" is brilliant, and this is an illustration of how humans can justify killing people. Also, in this day in age, alien invasion stories don't make sense. We now know there are millions of planets like Earth. There is no reason to invade an occupied planet. But, again, this could just be used to contrast humanity with a much more advanced species so to illustrate our failings. Finally, the mission to intercept the aliens on their path to Earth is just so dumb. What do they expect to accomplish by sending a frozen brain to them? It feels almost like a live version of ""Rick and Morty"". So, I don't know. Is ""3 Body Problem"" brilliant or stupid.

"When I first started the Netflix series ""3 Body Problem"" I was aghast at the first scene. So much gore and emotional trauma portrayed in a very political sense. I hesitated to continue watching. After reading some reviews and finding out the science foundation I decided to continue watching. The first act was slow and somewhat disjointed. The second act was excellent and developed the science foundation much better and drove more interest in the story plot line. The third act and conclusion was a total mess with a typical Benioff rushed conclusion. Knowing the novel is a trilogy, it certainly indicates a 2nd season is on the way. It is reported each episode for season 1 cost $20,000,000. Seems extravagant.",IMDB,Science Fiction or disaster movie?,5.0
"I haven't read the books, so I can't compare how faithfully they adapted the material, but purely as a sci fi TV show, this is the typical Netflix mediocrity we'll have to get used to.Some aspects are interesting, and some are painful to watch. While production is top-notch, casting is mostly a miss and the dialogue is extremely cringey at times. The science part is massively let down from the start (apparently, these super model scientists can individually ""check"" the source code of all the software in CERN and conclude there are no bugs), and the conversations and behavior of the ""scientists"" (especially the ones from UK) could not be more ridiculous. Also, who swears all the time for no reason?The show spends a lot of time in the group of friends and we get to see their relationships and dynamics, but they're all nonsensical and bland, and the characters are immediately forgettable, with zero arches or development. The acting itself is hit and miss as well.Cinematography is good, however, but let down by the music score. As for the story itself, it's strange, a lot of plot holes (these aliens are so advanced they can get into our heads and make the stars disappear, but they haven't solved the 3 body problem, and only decided to move from the literal hell they live in to another planet once they were contacted by a random Chinese girl). But if you ignore the super advanced, space-faring aliens who had to be reminded by the Communist Party of China (of all people?) that other planets are a thing, and why would they then choose already populated Earth (of all planets?) to move to, I guess it's watchable.The 7+ rating is a bit high, 1s and 2s are too low, I feel the 6 (which in my head means ""barely passing the mark"") is the appropriate rating.",IMDB,It's...

We only see faces with a dilemma, nothing more. The game they are playing is even more stupid since they do not do anything there, just simply talk few lines about their ""breakthrough"" theories taken out of a hat. The main characters are watchers of the whole drama the same as we are, everything important is explained or shown to them.

"This is just a mass of spoilers, getting stuff off my chest. This will be ""Unhelpfulled"" into the stone age by Netflix PR staff, so it will be interesting to see how many points of agreement it actually accumulates.There are some books that just appear at the right time, in the right place, and become famous regardless of what they contain. I'll never know what the 3 Body volumes contain because I've read enough goodreads reviews to fill me with horror.In any case, this isn't ""hard"" science fiction.This isn't ""Primer"", ""Person Of Interest"" or ""Severance"".It's space opera.For a start the technology mix is absurd:The aliens have FTL comms, and are able to work ""atto-tech"" programming of sub-atomic particles.Yet, their home environment still gives them problems, and they want to bring a fleet to a 100% biologically incompatible planet?And then, they have the manners and sensibilities of spoiled teenagers?Um, yeah, no.That's not hard-SF. That's sci-fantasy. That's stuff from yesteryear. That's Huge Gernsback, is what that is.Politely, we term it space opera these days.And in this case the nano-tech and VR stuff is pure stuffing to make the science seem ""harder"".Now I have no problem with space opera, not if it's entertaining. Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, Dark Matter, the high points of Star Wars (like Andor). Etc.But I do have a problem, regardless of genre, with being bored by boring characters. And my word, these are boring characters.The only people I didn't want to die were Liam Cunningham's intelligence chief, and Benedict Wong's police detective turned operative. Everybody else deserved a severe wiffle-batting to their smug faces.Also I don't believe the script even once passes the Bechdel Test? Maybe on top of Dish Mountain when the Incredibly Annoying Inexplicably (2nd book?) Strong Assassin and the Incredibly Annoying Original Protagonist are having their Buddy Death Talk? I can't recall, and I'm never going back to watch it so I'll never know.Anyway, there is one scene, one really good scene.You know what it is.When they mandolin an entire boat and its personnel using nano-wires.Now, this is a VERY silly scene. Not because of the science - that's actually right (for a change). Not because of how it plays out - that's actually REALLY good!

Because every armed force on the planet has divisions that are trained in this exact scenario! Covertly infiltrating or rush-raiding confined installations, boats, landed aircraft, you name it, and recovering assets without giving the occupants time to react.But no. Nano-wires. We MUST use nano-wires.Anyway, it's a fantastic scene despite its ridiculous justification: and it belongs in something else. Eg. An actual hard-SF thriller. Something about terrorists and future warfare, perhaps.And then we get to the end and ... it's not the end. Netflix couldn't be bothered making the entirety of the books into one run, and instead make us sit through all that interminable waffle and padding to get nowhere.Look, I did get some entertainment from this.

It's only when they take his sex doll wife & daughter away from him that he gets mad & starts to think about the alien problem. His grand plan is literally to broadcast a spell into the universe & he goes into a hibernation chamber straight after. But when all the other wallfacer plans fail, his works & he's the only thing on earth aliens fear & goes on to survive to the end (lots of sleep) where he's basically grown into Yoda & literally faces a wall for 5 decades. A character arc for the ages.Does Saul fit the description? Do any of the Oxford 5 have the hedonistic, isolationist, game theory strategy, IDGAF attitude to pull it off?",IMDB,"What they did to Luo Ji, Da Shi & Belhai is Disney deluxe",2.0
"Another story brutally destroyed by netflix. In fact I don't think they will get tired of destroying stories. The idiots will watch, the money is enough, everything is fine so they can pump out more disgusting propaganda. They flat out change everything from the book with no regard for anything except their talking points. They take something successful, pay the rights and destroy it because it makes them happy. I don't think they could've changed much more. They only seemed to at least try to preserve the original during the Chinese parts. Do not watch for any reason, watch the Chinese Three-Body series instead.",IMDB,extremely cringe,1.0

"I enjoyed the concept of the characters being tossed into a fully submerged AI to see if they were valuable to this alien race that were already on a long trip to Earth.It does bring to light that treating your ""employees"" or even your prisoners like garbage, may in a scify world, lead to them selling out the planet. Because they feel a new boss HAS TO BE BETTER!It was a MENTAL & PHYSICAL experience that Enders Game put all of the children through via all of their training to go up against an alien race expected to come to destroy and conquer Earth. 3BodyProblem seems to use the headset in a mental aspect only.There's always been a urban legend that video games like Call of Duty are being monitored to recruit new members into our military...and that they don't have to be physically fit...as they would be in charge of such things as drone strikes. Again... allegory to known things to make this seem believable.So it's NOT original in the slightest.No mystery, they show who is behind the screen of the AI headsets pretty much right off.Again, you cannot say the friendship group bond is new, because Enders Game had that as well. Or Friends. Or South Park.Netflix has already admitted that they make no promises to green light the shows to film Book 2 (Dark Forest) and Book 3 (Deaths End). Netflix can't be trusted.David Benioff and DB Weiss of the Game of Thrones disaster are less to be trusted than Netflix. D& D can never be trusted with ANYTHING anyone loves.Don't get invested.This series may be a one and done...so enjoy what you saw, and maybe read the books to find out the ending.",IMDB,Emotional scify ripoff,4.0

"3 Body Problem is a sci-fi fantasy drama spanning from 1960s China to 400 years in the future in the United Kingdom. Ye Wenjie, a brilliant astrophysicist, suffers a life-altering tragedy when she witnesses her father's brutal murder during the Cultural Revolution. This traumatic event profoundly shapes her worldview and becomes a driving force behind her fateful decision. Conscripted by the military due to her scientific expertise, she's sent to a secluded base where she makes a choice that will echo through time and space. Her decision to alert an alien civilization to Earth's location, despite warnings of their hostile nature, sets in motion a chain of events with far-reaching consequences. As the mystery unfolds at a deliberate pace, the series captivates viewers with a wealth of thought-provoking sci-fi concepts. It's an absolute must-watch for any sci-fi enthusiast.",IMDB,Truly amazing Truly,5.0
"I was really looking forward to this adaptation. Team behind GoT! Massive budget! Awesome books! Nope. The decision to change the book is, in principle, fine. You have to change things when you adapt something. The decision to turn the lead character into five unspeakably annoying 20-somethings is baffling. If you're going to create characters they have to be good characters, and these guys are not just bad, they make no sense! Eliza Gonzalez is a ""nanotech genius"" who has been working on her project for seven years. I guess she got her PhD at the age of 15? Which is also when she decided not to become a catwalk model in Paris, I guess, because she's WAY too beautiful to be any female scientist I've ever met. Absurd. The John Bradley character is a ""potato chip billionaire"" at the age of, like, 28. How? The self-conscious diversity is off the charts, pity they didn't pay the same attention to the quality of the script. The men are all really stupid, the women are all stunningly beautiful. They swear A LOT. They sit around being ""sexy and mysterious"" while the world is ending and every great scientist in the world is being killed. It's just so weird. The only redeeming features so far are the scenes during the Cultural Revolution in China. They have a realism that the rest of the series could have benefitted from. Just because something is a fantasy doesn't mean the world the characters live in doesn't need internal logic. The reverse - it has to be grounded reality for the fantasy to work. The laziness of these characters lifts you out of the fantasy and destroys any tension the series might have had.",IMDB,Such a let down,4.0
"This show does not deliver. It is a new form of series, which tells you NOTHING about the science or story beyond what you need to know to keep watching. So, don't even bother with season 1, it has no ending or explanation, it ends with a tragedy, and it only looks forward to the future, hoping for a renewal.I am getting sick of these streaming monstrosities. Why can't they do a decent job in 8 one-hour episodes? Instead, they harp on the most boring and STUPID things, while leaving the story untold, and the science, unexplained.The only thing positive that could from this is another season that would explain it, but it would turn into 5.I am now reading this was based on a book series. If so, read the books, but avoid the series. Just awful.",IMDB,"An entire season of tripe, just an attempt to get renewed",1.0

"I went into this series being prepared for a let-down as I was not confident the spirit of the excellent book series would be respected. But fortunately the 1st season stayed mostly true to the original author's vision. The book elicits a sort of spooky and primal fear in the reader, and the television adaptation hits these buttons well.""We will teach you to fear again."" - SophonEverything is not good, however. The show suffers by heavily westernizing the original Chinese source material. Constant profanity and plenty of nudity are added because western producers cannot think outside those boxes. It really hurts the believability of some scenes where these supposedly brilliant scientists argue, swear and jab at each other like a bunch of drunken teenagers.Casting is overall well-done, but the show made a terrible choice with Eiza González as Auggie. This character is portrayed with an air of condescension and stuck-up arrogance that ruins every scene she is in. By mid-season I was thoroughly hoping she would be killed off. I can only hope she is written-out or replaced for a presumed season 2. On the positive side, Liam Cunningham and Jess Gong are superb.",IMDB,Off to a good start,5.0
"Really? At first I liked the topic and the stories, but then it started to get ridiculous. Especially in the last two episodes, things got really messy and ridiculous. One of the heroes they choose to save the world is a terrorist. This is too ridiculous to be true. The woman they present as a Kurdish war hero is a terrorist. I think I won't watch this series anymore. I am sad. He's very bad at acting. The world's about to end and they just sit around drinking. A very beautiful subject has been ruined and wasted. The average score is decreasing with each section anyway. I wouldn't recommend watching it even if you have free time.",IMDB,This is a comedy,2.0
"This is one of those shows where if you have read the books, you will likely be disappointed.It is a very loose adaptation. They took a lot of events that happen in the books, and stitched them together in an unorganized and rushed fashion. Too many things happen too quickly for the viewer to really grasp the implications; the mystery, the dread, and the unfolding of one of the most unique stories science fiction has to tell.I have to say - I was fairly excited when I read that Benioff and Weiss were tackling the show. I think they did an excellent job with GoT until the source material ran out. In this case, the TBP books were completed, so I felt they had everything they would need to produce an excellent show. But it seems that ego, politics and mediocre writing got in the way of true artistic integrity: telling the story the author wanted to tell.Now we have another mediocre adaptation to add to the list, like RoP, WoT, and many others.",IMDB,They stripped the mystery and dread & awe that made TBP,5.0
There is some evidence that the creators understand science behind space travel but they failed to be consistent in presenting it. The story becomes boring and pretentious from time to time but the weakest part is the way the intelligence team behavior.We can easily imagine a better way to obtain the information from the ship computers than by not only killing all the people on it but destroying them in such a ridiculous way. The magic of having a device with data unbroken after the devastated effect of the nano-what? Rays/waves? Is an additional element of fantasy. It looks more plausible to have aliens coming than finding that device and being able to receive all the answers almost immediately.,IMDB,"Promising, failed to deliver",4.0
"I recently watched The Three-Body Problem on Netflix, and while the production quality is impressive, it can be a bit challenging to follow at times. The complex scientific concepts and multiple timelines require a lot of focus, and it sometimes feels like the show moves too slowly, which can make it hard to stay fully engaged.That said, the show can be hard to follow at times, especially for those unfamiliar with the source material. The story is intriguing, and the visuals are stunning. For fans of deep sci-fi, it's definitely worth a watch, but be prepared for a show that demands your attention. It may not be for everyone, especially if you're looking for something more fast-paced.",IMDB,Impressive but challenging.,5.0
"The Three-Body Problem"" promised to be a mind-bending journey through science fiction, but instead, it fell into the trap of tired clichés and predictable plotlines. The concept had so much potential, but the execution left much to be desired. From the stereotypical characters to the overused tropes, the movie never quite took off. Instead of offering fresh ideas or thought-provoking twists, it relied on well-worn paths that any seasoned sci-fi fan could see coming from a mile away. The visuals were cartoonish and obviously couldn't compensate despite the originality in the story. It's a shame because the source material had the depth ( I love Benioff) and complexity to offer something truly unique. Unfortunately, the film's adherence to formulaic storytelling made it a forgettable experience.*",IMDB,Original Story Line; Too Many Cliches,5.0
"I haven't seen the original Chinese version, so I don't know how much worse the Netflix remake is, but I have no doubt this is a mediocre try.While much efforts have been put into visuals, and the cinematography of the different alternative worlds are enjoyable, the makers seems to have tried to cut cost on actors. The lead roles, particularly John Bradley, Alex Sharp, Auggie Salazar, Jovan Adepo and Jin Cheng are terrible actors with a ridiculous performance in these series. They all play scientists, in a very ubelievable way. Ms Salazar is obviously not an actress, and I would recommend her taking acting classes if she didn't lack the skills for it at all. John Bradley and his terrible performance is so annoying that the pinnacle of the drama for me was his murder in episode 3. Most of his lines are just a series of F-words, which gets tiring very quickly.And this leads to the horrible dialogues, which are primitive, childish and full of unjustifiable usage of the F-word.I am sure this remake could've been a lot better shot with real actors and not amateurs, and with better dialogues.After having suffered my way through this terrible remake I'll find the original Chinese to figure out how better it is.",IMDB,"Poor casting, amateurish acting, ridiculous dialogues",3.0
"The premise of this show is of very high quality. The rest? Not so much.By the 4th episode, all I kept thinking about was that the show is not really about a ""reality"" of a fictional universe. Instead, illogical things happen just for the sake of entertaining the viewer. This was even more obvious given the poorly executed production. Take for instance Oppenheimer and try to count how many things happen in some 5 minutes - then compare it to this. Time is allocated inefficiently and same copy-pasted format is used to create dramatic scenes with music that always tells you how to feel and spoils what is going to happen many seconds in advance.What's more, the show took sharp turns and failed to form a coherent story. At the start, there are dead scientists, timers, and other specific details that are very specific but do not have any real meaning apart of being a tool for artificial drama. Also, it is clear that somehow sensory information can be interpreted as well as fabricated by the advanced VR technology. At the same time, timer can be projected onto anyone's retina etc. But at the end, it is said that ""mind cannot be read"". Also why would aliens call people ""bugs"". It all feels just so cheap. It doesn't matter whether this could ""really"" happen. Writers are the gods in this world. They have a responsibility to create a good TV Show. ""Bugs"" are just plain cheap as well as the other ""wow"" details. Think Tenet - now that's the exact opposite. No BSing around (I love it - although I still do not understand how such a crazy fun experiment could become a blockbuster movie).Perhaps the worst sin of this show is its depiction of science and scientists. Forget the obvious stereotypical critique - smartest scientists being automatically particle physicists at Oxford that are depicted unfaithfully (look at Oppenheimer and see the difference). Fake scientific jerking off with nerdy talks at bars also did not help. But there are more major flaws in regards to science. Let's go back to Tenet as it is a perfect example of how science in very far-stretched sci-fi movies/shows should be done. What happens, happens. When something unexpected happens, it does not ""break"" old discoveries (unless the methodology used was incorrect - I am looking at you replication crisis in psychology). If often reveals that our models need to be generalized (think Newtonian physics and relativity - Newtonian physics fits almost perfectly our everyday experience - we use it to model animated movies and pc games and none of us notice. It's a pretty good model). Unexpected observations are what we really really want - that's why we invested billions into CERN. However, all this and more was still tolerable. What felt like a spit in the face was the communication with aliens and their reaction that humans are liars and deceitful. I wish this show focused more on fundamental abstractions and principles present in our universe - maybe it could've at least tried to explain how did the aliens understand Chinese. There are universal concepts (it's not a coincidence the adjective is similar to the word ""universe"") all advanced civilizations will know and concepts about communication will definitely be among them. E.g. Viruses tricking receptors of human cells - that is deception or ""lying"". Any complex system will feature information exchange in some way - and inevitably all the concepts associated with it. Also precision is often as important as truthfulness when analyzing statements (everybody is a liar - although often not intentionally - it's a continuous value). We should all strive to learn all our lives - that is moral.Less is more sometimes. This show could have been really good. People love sci-fi and are completely okay with accepting key plot points without much reasoning - especially if the writers do not have it. This show did not dare enough and felt lazily written, with some details and additional content actually harming its overall quality.",IMDB,"Well done show, you played yourself",3.0
"I watched a show years ago, all 39 episodes, was loving it right up until the end, it was about a group of people that circumstance made them friends. They weren't always good to each other, had to sometimes forgive and move on, I think it's the push and pull of emotions, sort of like the kneading of bread dough that allows us to see the real human. Anyway I was really enjoying the show and they just ended it, a giant fleet of alien ships shows up and I'm wondering ""how are they gonna get out of this"" ??

"The book is a masterpiece so it's difficult to match, sure, but the writing on this show is formulaic, immature, and completely ruins the experience. This is written by an executive team. It uses cool elements from the book, but has no soul.What's very disappointing is that this book has one of the coolest, most nuanced, interesting and deep female characters in sci fi. They flattened her and took her out of the center of the story. Then they filled it with archetypical flat soulless Hollywood characters. Then they ruined the science when they introduced a random superhuman.It's bad. It's the story of a master retold by teenagers.",IMDB,"If you love the book, this show is awful.",2.0
"There is a lot to suggest up-front, with a strong cast in front of and behind the cameras in particular, that this was going to be a really good watch, and to be fair it starts that way. However, it did not, for me at least, end that way.Science has gone mad, results from the likes of Super Colliders are not making sense. Scientists are killing themselves or giving up on their work.The investigation around this is linked to flashbacks of 1960s Communist China and events to do with the early life of a scientist who is the mother of one who takes their own life in the present.And what is this mysterious futuristic headset and game that some have been invited to play?The first sign of real issues with the show occurred (being careful not to give things away here with the wording and description of this) with communication between two of the antagonists being conducted in a bizarrely childish and inept way, which leads to devastating consequences.Things could have been a whole lot different had this communication been thought through more (which they had decades to do), although the consequences may well have happened anyway. But these were smart people being devastatingly stupid and naive, and not at a young, tender, inexperienced age, either.Had this communication been handled more 'professionally', it would have been far more believable, even if it still failed as spectacularly as it did. That could have happened anyway, and with the same consequences.The antagonists had created a massive, secret 'cult' of followers, over decades, but hadn't thought through their most critical of communications. This part of the story was just unbelievable, facepalm stuff. It felt as if it might have been dumbed down.At this point you might have expected a close-up of a devastated antagonist and an, ""Oh, no, what have I done"", sort of expression, to underline what had happened. But it was underplayed, instead.In responding to the fallout of this, the 'good guys', now that they know what is going on, and acting now from their new, singular purpose, take drastic action. The ethics of what they do and how they do it, is all handled almost as an aside, seemingly only affecting one of the characters strongly.For me, the story unravelled here, and most of the characters with it. The story had become simplified from its starting point, I had lost respect and interest in the main characters to the point where I was almost sympathetic to the 'bad guys' and what they were hoping to achieve.Isn't that a major fail for a TV show?The series seems to have set-us up for future seasons all to do with this singular purpose, which to me just seems dull. I'm no longer interested in how we get to where the story is going, or indeed, any such conclusion.Given the whole lack of ethics in a modern setting, and what will probably be a series that continues to have an increasing and gory body count, a-la Game of Thrones, I won't be watching any season 2 et seq.",IMDB,"A major disappointment, an unravelled plot, Game of Throne ethics in a modern setting.",5.0
