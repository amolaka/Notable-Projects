"Billy Crudup owns this show!","The show is amazing, but wow, what a remarkable performance by Billy Crudup. He totally kills it! I love his character, so funny. We need more of him! Great work! Of course, the rest of the cast is also amazing! Great job everyone!",9
"Surprisingly Addictive","I was never a big fan of either Anniston or Witherspoon but they are really, really good in these roles. Production values are excellent (product placement aside) and kudos to the writers for the nuanced approach to delicate social issues... and Billy Crudup has the best lines!",9
"Such an amazing cast!","The Morning Show is an pretty good drama led by such an amazing cast. It takes you behind the scenes of a morning show and gives you a candid look at what makes the show go and the lives of the people involved in it. It may start a little slow for some but stick with it because it gets better as the show goes on. It seems like the entire cast was nominated for their jobs in this show (Steve Carrel, Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass) and for good reason...they were all terrific! It's obviously a star studded cast but it's not only the stars that make this show so good, the writing is well done too. Now for some reason season 2 isn't nearly as good as the first seasons. It's still worth watching just not as entertaining. I hope future seasons get back to the quality of of the first season.",8
"After the last episode !","Rarely it happens when a new streaming service comes out, and it has a show that is so good and binding, I can't help but give 10 stars !",10
"One of the best shows I've seen in years..","It's real, it's dramatic and it's creative. The photography is amazing and the characters are interesting and relatable.",10
"Worth Watching!","First of all The Morning Show has one of the best overall casts of any show on tv. Just to name some of the actors in this are Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, etc. With a cast like that you just know the show is worth watching. The first season is the best but the second is still pretty good. It's one of the rare shows where each episode gets better and leaves you wanting more. It's a fast paced show that you'll want to binge watch as quickly as you can. Season three is coming out later this year and I'm looking forward to watching it.",8
"Apple doesn't disappoint with this one.","I was skeptical and this show wasn't even on my radar, but after watching the first episode, I was hooked. I binged the next 4 in 2 days. Great show! The acting is superb. The story is interesting. It touches on issues of the day with finesse and doesn't preach. Which is hard to find these days. The casting is pretty perfect. Billy Crudup steals the show. Awesome work, Apple!",8
"Powerful!!!","I am still in awe by the season final! This is outstanding.. you moved me. I feel so empowered",10
"Thats how you do a show on feminism.","Complex emotions on all sides. Appealing to human nature. Not overly preachy. Makes you think about cause and effect.The acting is just over the top amazing. The performances by every single actor was A+.",9
"Season 2 is not it","Compared to Season 1...a dip in writing, acting and storyline. I also think it's a cop out to end the first season with a bombshell where every main character trashes and/or leaves the network and then immediately follow it with the next season where they are all back at UBA. Not creative.",6
"Welcome back to TV Jennifer!","What a fantastic return to form for Jennifer Aniston! Her ability to encapsulate a character right from the first episode with such depth, with an incredible supporting cast including a role that could only be played by an actor like Steve Carrol, the complexities of such an intensely debated topic as the MeToo movement, which has been so integral in allowing society to take that important step forward, while allowing narratives to take place that under different acting ability could very easily lost. Reese is exceptional in a role that feels formed to her.I'm looking forward to seeing where this program about a program can take us!",10
"Solid First Season","The first season was very good and I would have given the show a higher ranking but season 2 is weak. It has become very soap-opera-ish. Too many chaotic tangential stories and lots of annoying hysterics.",7
"Stopped watching at S3:5 (in the middle of the episode)!","This is why I wait to rate shows. I, like many others, enjoyed season 1. I never took this show very seriously, as it so soapy it seems like it's that way on purpose- almost like a parody. The overly dramatic bits made me laugh. It's popcorn drama, a bit of fluff, I can turn off my brain and enjoy the train wreck while being entertained by some good actors. It was never going to be Shakespeare, and it didn't need to be. Unfortunately, this show starts to take itself too seriously by season 3. I'll get back to that in a mo.I thought season 1 handled the #MeToo issue sensitively and offered a more balanced view than we are normally privy to. Things started to go downhill in season 2 and the writers became more and more heavy-handed with their agenda, and it's very obnoxious. Which brings me back to season 3. I am as progressive as the next gal, but being punched in the face with ""wokeness"" (not a term I normally use) is cringeworthy and insulting. And it's endless. It's not a sprinkling, it's a downpour. It's such a turnoff; hence, the turning off of the show entirely in the middle of S3:5. They have become the opposite of subtle. It's embarrassing. It makes me embarrassed to be a progressive (but not enough to join the dark side). It IS possible to present your ideas in an intelligent, subtle and thought-provoking manner; I like shows that make me think, not shows that tell me what to think.It is unfortunate that more and more shows are like this. Preachy. It reminds me of 80s shows and how they all had to have a moral to their stories. *eyeroll*",5
"Wish I could rate seasons separately","I would rate season 1 an 8. It tackles a lot of social issues while still remaining entertaining and still doesn't get too preachy.I would rate season 2 a 5 at best. It is boring and attempts to include so many issues that it becomes a woke nightmare. Stop after season 1 if you aren't on board the woke train.",10
"Best character on tv goes to Billy Crudup!","I just binge watched, (unintentionally) the first season and I have to say it was one of the best shows I've seen in a while. Is it perfect, no, but that's what makes it great! Billy Crudup's character was perfect! Both well written and played. He deserves all the praise in the world for this role, as does Reese Witherspoon. I was so motivated to write this after reading how certain critics (Sophie Gilbert) for example thought the show was poorly made, referencing too many cooks in the kitchen, so to speak. But for me, the chaotic nature of the show and the levity Crudup's character (Cory) brought to every scene was worth the price of admission. So I cannot wait to see what season 2 will bring. Hopefully the same balance of characters and comedy that killed quarantine day 23 for me.
Bravo Apple+ !",9
"Bill Crudup is a revelation","Billy Crudup in the Morning Show series is the most consistent, compelling and nuanced actor I have seen in ages. I have not seen him in other movies or if I have I don't remember his performance, but he is a revelation in this role and I found that I wanted to see him in scene after scene. His acting was nuanced, yet bold and brash and completely absorbing. I hope there is a season 4 and that he returns for every episodes and that he continues to find a way to outsmart and control the network as he set out to do and that he finds some reward for the unfulfilled depth of the emotion that you can see in his performance.",10
"Holy Moly I am Speechless","I had to create an account just so I could come on here and say just how incredible this show is. I ended up bingeing it in three days (couldn't do it all in one day as it is quite emotionally heavy in some parts). The finale was so brilliant I was sobbing, shocked and overwhelmed with emotion. Wow. Just wow.",9
"Apple+ has set a high bar","{Initial Impressions} Can you call it an initial impressions when you are 6 episodes deep into a 10 episode series? It's just that good! Once I started watching it, I couldn't stop until I was caught up. The acting is great. The cast is accomplished, both stars and supporting performers. The story is well defined. Do not be mislead, this is a serious drama. I can't say enough good things about it. Apple+ has set a high bar for itself with this inaugural series. I give it a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Drama}",8
"Excellent show - Stella was terrible!","This show had excellent writing and a great storyline. The character development was great and the cliff hangers were well thought out. HOWEVER, Stella's character in the second season was terrible. This character was just thrown into the second season with a prominent role and no backstory, while she continuously berates other characters throughout the season. It's hard to not hate that character, in my humble opinion.",10
"It's like a crescendo into justice.","People who don't think it's good writing, didn't watch the whole thing. It's a slow burn. But wow what an incredible show. I hope it wins all the awards and inspires more people to stand up for what is right in this world.",7
"Season 1 is 8 stars, season 2 is 5","Season 1 had a good, interesting, story line, that grabbed you from the beginning. Kept you watching esp in anticipation on what will happen in the rivalry between the 2 female leads. But they suddenly coming together in end in that show of woman solidarity was more depressing cop out, enough to drop the season from a 9 to an 8.Unfortunately, it seems they had no idea of what follow up story to tell in season 2, other than just showing a bunch of rich media people being ambitious, competitive, nasty, and neurotic. The Witherspoon character's particularly irritating, and she's spent half the season shouting at people. Crudup is best, he's held the series together. And the Carrel character's an interesting watch. As the guy who's fell off the mountain top...and, alas, has to console himself with the millions he's made. (And Carrel even has a resemblance to Matt Lauer)",9
"Excellent show. Great acting. Gripping story","Loved the first three episodes. Story flows smooth. Acting from great actors is upto the mark.",6
"Season one outstanding; season two meh","Season one really hit all the right notes. Season two tripped and fell. Alex needs a good whack upside the head. And what happened to Bradley? She's a totally different person. Cory has become inept window dressing. And Chip needs better lines than uh I'm sorry um. The little Asian girl is obnoxious. One of the best characters is the Italian reporter! I have grown tired and weary of the bickering and backstabbing and who is going to blame who. Basically the show just needs to grow up.",5
"Wait....did they forget to write a screenplay?","After a pretty decent first season, viewers are now into episode seven of the second season and many must be thinking (like me): ""Wait, did they forget to actually write a screenplay for season 2?"".There is really nothing intriguing about this show during this season. Storylines, dialogue and character development; it's all really ""mèèèh"" at best this time around and mostly really just boring and uninteresting.Dialogues just seem never-ending and are not compelling in the slightest.Of course I noticed on various other Apple shows as well that screenwriting is apparently not in the list of requirements set by Apple.But they could have at least tried, right? Talented actors and most likely tons of money to spend.What a complete waste of budget and talent this show has become... just a pile of garbage to be really honest.5 out of 10 (and that's only due to an above average season 1).",9
"IMDB rating","You can score a show and each episode, but you should be able to score each season.I don't score episodes, only an unique score for the show. But in this case, like in many others, this doesn't reflect my opinion.The morning show season 1 is an 8 for me. Season 2 is may be a 5. How can I express that?I think it'd be cool to say people, ""look season 1, and stop right there"".",8
"9/10 for the first 5 character driven episodes but then it falls apart","The first 5 episodes are excellent. The writing is almost all top notch, the balance of storylines feels good, and it felt like a debate, an eye opener was being allowed to form. Would have been 10 with some better casting, but really, a top show.Then came episode 6 and it felt at first like really clumsy, unsubtle, political mid season filler. Really poor.Episode 7 wasn't as clumsy but simply ill considered. The tension given by the internal spaces of 1-5 was lost, replaced with poor quality CGI, open spaces that felt like they were there for posing and, yet again, a filler feel.Episode 8 got things back on track but together with 9 and 10 had firmly switched to event driven writing with the vents feeling forced and designed to reach a setup. So the intrigue, the sense that these could be real people, and the essential need for the stories to feel that they came from the characters was lost Well, almost. There was some of the good stuff but it was a small amount, drowned by the ""let's now show this chess move, then that chess move"", and characters acting the way Eps 1-5 hadn't set up at all.I persevered because 1-5 had been so good but overall 5-10 dragged this down to a 6 for me. And I stopped there after seeing the reviews for season 2.Stand out. Carrell. He gets written poorly more in 6-10 but when he got the material, 10/10. Weakest lead, Witherspoon because she wasn't right for the part. Should have been someone in their 30s at oldest, better still late 20s, someone who actually felt and looked different to Aniston. Best support, Harden by a mile. Weakest (unfortunately for the show) Mbatha-Raw.",8
"S1 was excellent","I only wished there were the possibility to rate seasons independently. S1 was excellent yet S2 was a mediocre Show at best, with after the established brilliantly gripping writing and character development felt like a letdown.S2's motto was ""cancel culture"" which is an infuriatingly annoying subject by itself, and makes it almost impossible to sympathize with any of the characters anymore. And once you can't sympathize or root for characters a show is doomed.I'd rate S1 with a 9,5/10 and S2 with a 5/10.",10
"Two words: Jennifer Aniston","This show is Jennifer's hands down. She is playing her career best right now and I'm loving every moment of her. She deserves all of the awards that are eventually coming her way! I can't wait to see where the rest of this show goes, I'm completely hooked with Jennifer. The male characters are very well acted, Steve Carrell, Billy Crudup is at his best and Mark Duplass is turning me into a fan. Steve Carrell's character is a little too uncomfortably on the nose to Matt Lauer. I think that part is a little weird for me still, I still slightly cringe when I see Steve Carrell's scenes and story line. I suppose that's the point? I think overall it's a good look behind the curtain of the politics and bs that goes on behind closed doors.",10
"I never give 10s","I absolutely LOVE this show! I wasn't interested, but decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. I don't want the episodes to end. Great acting, and great story. 10!",8
"Give It a Chance","The show begins to find itself in episode 3. It's great to see Jennifer Aniston take on a role like this. She, Reese and Billy Crudup are great as is the rest of the cast. All the famous faces make it a fun watch regardless. Looking forward to episode 4.",10
"Something Wickedly Good Comes This Way","A delightful onion of story, character and motive reveal. Amazing actors playing off each other like a fine Bach musical movement with Reece Witherspoon, Jennifer Anniston and Billy Crudup. Just to watch the unfolding, both subtle and explosive between these three, is worth the watch.It takes on the meetoo situation in a very balanced way. I am fully aware of how much agenda there is in Hollywood, usually left leaning politically, but also often hysterically too far left regarding any other issue (racism, sexism, capitalism etc), this program is not guilty of picking sides. It beautifully portrays the deadly crossing of lines and perception of what sexual abuse is. Can't say I have ever seen sexual exploitation portrayed so well, so subtly. All the power plays and players, both male and female, feeding into the problem, without the histrionics and manipulation of feminism turning everybody off.Near the end of the season, the trip back in time to when Mitch (Steve Carroll) was King of the Morning Show, illustrates how he himself had already been seduced by glory, and spoilt by money and attention, finding his life somehow still wanting, as expressed to his friend (Martin Short). He is almost tempting fate to take it all away. Whilst looking for some meaning or even frivolity to relieve his dissatisfaction, someone else ultimately pays a deadly cost, as he is blind to his own flaws, but can clearly see them in others. Was the power the real reason for his ineptitude as a human being or was he inherently corrupt, or worse still - just a ""normal man""?Other great satisfactions to be found in all the support players as they take part in a very real feeling vibe of the situation of behind the scenes on a mainstream TV channel. I gather many of the makeup and camera people seen on camera are not usually actors but real makeup and camera people, playing themselves.Lovely to see Jennifer Anniston playing such a complex human, she clearly understands all the dynamics. Billy Crudup is a terrific character, a ""magician"", seer or mischievous jester, but a part of the top corporate structure, his power play is 4D chess those above him didn't see coming.Congratulations to the script writers, who don't insult the intelligence of the audience at any point.",6
"Enjoyed season 1. Season 2 is just unpleasant & not enjoyable.","Really enjoyed season 1 but season 2 has lost all the fun and spark of the 1st season. I watch ad how's for the enjoyment but this season is disjointed and I feel like they forgot what made the first season so good.",10
"This one gets it ALL correctly...","This series is a masterpiece in relevance, production, acting, and writing. Extremely good performances by a broad cast. The writing soars, expertly defining the voice of each character's perspective, and delivering insights that are timely, believable, and poignant. Many perspectives and attitudes about sexual exploitation of workers is cast during first few episodes, and throughout the series justifications and rationales are tested, considered, and dispatched. The finale is best savored, with some of greatest performances; particularly Anniston's-unrivaled in her storied career. Jen draws from decades of learning and self-knowledge to portray a highly visible icon's breakdown and tantrum as she demonstrates what female strength and it's many facets, truly is for all to see; strength to tolerate the ""boy's club"" while finding ways to succeed despite it; strength to stand face-to-face with competition and show no signs of it in the veneer; strength to give-up and back-off when the stakes run too high; and strength to change the unfair rules. Besides Anniston, many other amazing performances are delivered: Witherspoon, Polway, Mbatha, Crudup, Carrell and many more...all are nuanced, expertly delivered, which goes back to the writing: Bravo! Excellent! Well done!",6
"Season 1 was 'must-watch' tv, season 2 is almost unwatchable","I loved season 1, which was cast perfectly and well-written. The story lines tied together nicely and I really felt like this could be what morning television productions are like. With all the A-list actors that I love, I was pleasantly surprised that Billy Crudup stole the show for me. I couldn't wait for season 2 to come out given the season 1 cliff-hangers.....Then season 2 happened. -sigh- What a mess. A few characters whom I won't name, are clearly out of their acting league. Story lines that expanded from season 1 have become uninteresting and distracting. The drama is amped up to the point of becoming annoying. The mood swings of main characters shred empathy and credibility. I never thought I could be annoyed with a Jennifer Aniston character, but here you go.I suppose many second seasons struggle with expanding story lines introduced in first seasons. That's expected to a degree. But this feels like it is written by separate teams of writers. No cohesion. Every character has become insufferable. I'll struggle through the rest of the season, with the hope season 3 can recapture the magic. I'm not overly optimistic.",9
"So much more than the sum of its parts","I'd put off watching The Morning Show because I thought it would be a Sorkin-lite style Newsroom series set in a breakfast show and that felt like a tired format with nothing new to say. How utterly wrong I was. Yes it's got the big names. Yes it has clearly had a vast amount of money thrown at it, but that doesn't mean it isn't one of the most gripping tv series I've watched in years. The series builds and builds, the tension cranking up with each episode, literally at points, leaving me breathless. What I found particularly remarkable is that the #metoo movement is seen through so many different perspectives but cleverly the writers allow each perspective to live its own truth, whether or not that is a reliable truth or not, morally right or not, and in doing so it weaves this uncomfortable narrative that exactly reflects the rich and strange tapestry that is the real world. I thought that aspect of it was audacious. To not bring judgement and spoon feed an audience is a brave and risky thing to do. The performances are stellar, it's an ensemble cast with everyone bringing their A game. I devoured this first series in a couple of days and cannot wait for series 2. Can they replicate the clever and nuanced storytelling of this first series, I hope so.",10
"Fantastic!","Finally after being quarantined and watching so many duds .... yeah talking about you Sweet Magnolias, here is an excellent script with excellent performances! Billy Crudup, however, steals the show. He literally lights up the screen everytime he's on. This show is an absolute winner!",9
"It doesn't get better than this!","This is the best series I've seen in a while. Character development and depth is second to none.",8
"Engaging and darker than you think","Undeserved critics reviews. After episode 1, I'm really enjoying this look at an all to common scenario that has been playing out in our news. Solid performances by all the cast and beautifully produced. Aniston, Witherspoon and Carrell do not disappoint.",9
"Peak tv has reached apple","They apparently tapped some of the best in the game for this one. Great start for Apple TV+ and another highlight for viewers who live in the time of peak tv",10
"Amazing, great writing, great acting, good visuals","I just finished the final episode of series 1. It's the best show I ever watched. The plot is perfect, the acting is amazing, the story is delicate and true, and the camera work is phenomenal. Add to this some great music, and some fantastic plot changes and you have a really winner. Amazing.",6
"Should have ended after season 1","This show felt like it was set up to be a one season story and it should have been. Season one was great, energetic and had one of my most satisfying season finals.Season 2 was so pointless and had no real storyline. This season felt completely different, slow paced, monologs that were trying to replicate the writing from season one but came off as pointless rambling, overdramatic moments for the sake of drama.Spoilers: Season one told us that Mitch was an awful horrible person with hardly any redeeming qualities. Season two continues his story away from the other cast and it's boring. They tried to make him a sympathetic character out of no where and it didn't fit season ones story. I understand that the world's not just black and white and maybe Mitch isn't 100% a total bad guy but season one sure told us he was.",10
"Increadibly well written and acted","I was goint to skip this one because I thought it would be some usual caricatural hollywood bs: men bad women good or men good women bad or men bad women good but then men become good or some other variation on these boring tropes.
Oh but no, not at all. What we have here is one of the best shows I've seen in years. Incredibly nuanced without turning away or simplifying the issues at hand: It walks a tight rope and is unapolagetic in it's honesty. It does not pontificate, it doesn't overdramatize, it doesn't take sides because there are no sides, we're all in this together: it just shows. It shows the reality of the double standards, the complicity, the delusions ON ALL SIDES. Men, and women. Both have agendas, both can be predatory, both can be corrupted, both can be opportunistic. Everyone is part of this messed up system. There is no caricature, there's, no black and white, no monster predator. It is way more insiduous, way more complicated, shades of grey that still make you cringe and question all the same without pontificating at you because the moral relativism is sooo obvious. No monster predators, just your every day predators or opportunists, that's what makes it so pernicious. That's what makes the issue so complex. Of course monster predators do exist, but what usually happens in most workplaces is way more complex and convoluted than that.
But don't worry there are no long soliloques about the injustices of this or that. It just shows, bares witness and looking from the outside you'll finally get it if you haven't so far, even if you've never been confronted by this.
If you've ever worked in a corporate environment for more than 10 years you'll have many flashbacks, especially if you've been in a management position. Everyone is complicit in this culture but it still doesn't make it right. How do we change it without making everything awkward and turning us into robots? The show doesn't have an answer but it definitely shows how complex these issues are. If the conversations around the Metoo movement were this honest we might actually be able to move forward instead of just pointing fingers back and forth at an imaginary well defined other side. Hope this show is able to keep up this level of reality.",7
"Series 2 Flopped","Series 1 builds each episode to a great climax, so there was anticipation for Series 2 to continue, but it just never gets going, too much emotion, too many superfluous character side stories, not enough story or new plot lines.Even the actors seem to be waiting for something to happen, but it doesn't, crying and arguing about nothing each episode becomes dull. If there is a third series it will need to improve.",2
"9 for first season, 2 for second season","I don't understand why IMDb still doesn't separate the score for each season (yet a special score for an episode).Billy C was charming and owns the character in the 1st season. Second season, not so much.I am so over the special episodes for Steve Carrell (seriously, why? He has turned into a saint after a year? Even if he does, I really don't care and don't want to watch; a glimpse of news is enough) and Jennifer Aniston (when she's in Italy, when she's sick and got exposed). Feels very forced just to make her significant but the character was just so flaw that what she did and the exposure for her really seems self deserving. In fact, no one in the second episode seems to really matter and make me care.",10
"Very impressed","I am loving this series! 3 episodes in and I think it's amazing - not sure I understand the poor previous reviews - Jennifer Anniston is outstanding and Reese Witherspoon is phenomenal",8
"Great first season. Second season was horrible . Hoping they will get it together for the 3rd","I loved the first season of this show. I didn't remember much about the second season . But I just rewatched it all since they are releasing the 3rd season in September. I am stunned at how bad the second season is in comparison to the first. The build of of tension and suspense in the first season was non existent in the second. Alex Levy's ""breakdown""s worked ok in the first season but by the time she closed the show with her covid induced tantrum / rant . I was so bored I was falling asleep and definitely hated the character. They pretty much messed up every great character in this show .Bradley didn't just have a moment of questioning how to handle who she is and her personal & professional relationships. They turned her into a whiney baby who didn't just fall in love but became wide eyes and too dependent on her new love. Instead of really leaning into that relationship between her and Laura . The writing felt false and contrived . When Bradley busted into the hospital to find her brother at the end. She seemed like a completely different character . Suddenly the truth teller who cared so much about others didn't seem to care about what was happening with covid . Busted into a hospital( illegally and maskless) to find her brother . Who cares who she exposed and who was dying around her. Totally inconsistent with the character in the first season. The only decent storyline was killing off Mitch suddenly & the aftermath of someone's death who was a complicated person. They really should have ended the season with that cliffhanger . Because the last couple of episodes were almost unwatchable . I feel like they teased us with little bits of possible great characters , like Stella , Laura and Sarah Paulsons partner in real life whose name escapes me but is excellent in everything she does. They barely gave us any of the cute yanko Claire romance . Let us think we might see Charlie actually happy, but then turned him back into someone who is far too obsessed with Alex. The Daniel storyline was a disappointment, they could have let us see more into Mia's life . But nope they gave that screen time to Jennifer Anniston doing next to nothing most of the season. Driving in the car in Italy , having breakdowns in her apartment , being sick and delusional with covid , chopping wood in Main. Limping around Vegas threatening journalists. In fact her character barely had any time when she wasn't angry , sick , sad & whiny . They went way too far trying to make Alex a complicated and real person with a dark side and just made her obnoxious . In fact most of the characters were obnoxious this season. Even sweet Corey wasn't fun to watch. I don't blame the actors . I think the writing was just bad the second season. Further complicated by the covid storyline which a lot of shows struggled with . I'm sure they had to get creative on how to film. But it seemed like it would have been better to cut the season short and film the rest after covid. The concept of this show is great. I love the cast. I just hope they can redeem it in season 3.",9
"Brilliant, Intelligent and Authentic","It's been a while since I've watched a TV show that hits every mark like The Morning Show. The acting and writing here is simply superb. It would have been easy to say that one particular actor/actress makes this show what it is, but the truth is there isn't. Every single scene is enthralling and impossible to look away from - I'm especially referring to a scene with Cory and Fred following Alex's announcement of Bradley as her new co-host - you'll know which scene this is when you see it because it's one of the finest pieces of acting I've seen on Billy's part.It's also quite daring that this show goes very close to the 'me too' movement, whilst also being Apple's debut into original productions. You have to respect the show and the writers for this, given how current and ongoing this movement is. It shines a light on the other side of the accusations and the impact this has on Mitch - played wonderfully as expected from talent such as Steve Carell.Overall, I can't praise every aspect of this show enough - go ahead and watch it! Well done Apple!",10
"Brilliant show","This series is absolutely fantastic! The acting and script are simply outstanding and storyline is great. Billy Crudup is an incredibly talented actor, and his performance in every episode is consistently excellent. You just can't help yourself but like him.Jennifer Anniston and Reese W also delivers an amazing performance. Overall all the cast is just perfectly selected.This show keeps you hooked from start to finish and it was impossible to stop watching.Don't understand why the bad reviews. It's an absolute must watch if you enjoy a mix of drama, intrigue, and a glimpse of behind the scenes of morning news.",8
"I take back everything I thought about Jennifer Aniston","Yes Steve Carell and Reese Witherspoon are good actors but Jennifer Aniston surprised me. I am just guessing she just didn't get the roles to show what she could do. And together, this is a great ensemble cast that works well and creates a believable TV show. I love the believable office dialogue where people fling the F-word like it's just another adjective. So much of TV is lickspittle pandering to the PC police that we seldom see and hear real life. I especially enjoy the jabs at all news shows morning or night-time news which spend only 10 to 15 minutes on news then move off to infotainment about movie stars or what passes for celebrity like the Kardashian who offer their audience nothing but filler. Not all is positive as the show does pull some punches and jabs instead of going for the KO.
In episode 3 look for a great conversation between Steve Carell and Martin Short. And Billy Crudup is great as a sort of Iago running full power with seemingly motivationless malignity; However, I suspect we will find out just what his motivation is.",9
"Makes you look hard at our sexual behaviour as a species...","You watch it and you realise the guy committing the crime is clueless as to what he's doing... You realise the victims have no idea what's happening sometimes. It makes you realise that other people do not see reality like you do.It blew my mind... to watch so many ""good people"" play a part on such a dynamic stage of humanity.We have a lot of work to do...This show does well to showcase that.Beautiful script, performances (many awards should be forthcoming), and editing.5 star experience as a season.N",10
"Season 1 GREAT","Season 2:Wining.Just nothing going on.The only thing I like is Mitch's storyline.",7
"TMS","As a big fan of Apple, I'm ashamed to say I've come relatively late to the party in terms of AppleTV+ and I'm really regretting that. Barring one underperforming title (Greyhound) the three shows I've watched have been varying degrees of spectacular. Mythic Quest? Great fun. Ted Lasso? Feel good winner of a comedy that I fell in love with. Now coming to The Morning Show and... Wow. MQ and Lasso bring a lot of fun but TMS is a slow burning show that knows how to hit the audience right in the feels, grab hold and not let go. By the time TMS hits its stride it is not only tremendously prescient, relevant television but it is gripping and heart-stopping. The characters are rich and developed, it's filmed beautifully, it twists and turns in ways that feel entirely earned and realistic and the ending (of season one) is just breathtaking.I love a good slow show that takes its time building to where it wants to be, I do feel like TMS starts a little slower than I'd like, hence the not quite perfect rating, but this really is stunning once it hits its stride. I feel like, with TMS added to the growing list of great content, Apple TV+ is turning into this sleeping dragon of a streaming platform that sooner or later people are going to wake up to and realize how stunningly good it is.All that said, this addresses the #MeToo movement and it doesn't pull punches so if you're worried about being triggered, be warned.",9
"Starts promising and gets boring","Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston are a promising mix for a series. And in the first two episodes it has everything that promises suspense, a bit of humor and great characters, because the successful Alex Levy and the provincial brat Bradley Jackson couldn't be more opposite. It's obvious that an explosive mixture can result, but what if this expectation is not fulfilled? What if, instead, there is suddenly room for clichéd private problems and the actual subject matter, namely the production of a morning show, recedes more and more into the background? Then we have the usual dilemma of a series that could soon be forgotten. Even if season 2 is like that, it will probably end up like that, which would be a pity, because this is where possibilities are lost. Unfortunately once again.",6
"Season 2 totally destroys what season 1 has built","Season 1 was, as so many reviews say, kind of interesting, and actually had a decent story and some interesting characters in it. All that was left out in season 2, because apparently all the viewers are expected to donis watch Jennifer Aniston's locked into one position's mouth trying to act out some emotion through here face.... It's ridiculous what actresses and actors do to themselves just to keep looking younger, and the unnatural look it creates is just terrible and ruins the shows and movies their in....",5
"Updated after season 2","The first 3 episodes are pretty much the setup for the show.Where it takes us from here remains to be seen, as episode 4 (presumably) is where the show starts to find its permanent form, and the characters start to develop, now that all the pieces are put in place.It is clearly going to become a very story driven show, so whether it becomes a 10 or a 5, will be all about the story, and that is still an unknown quantity.The cast is fantastic, albeit so far a little type cast, the overall production quality top notch, so at this point, based off the first 3 episodes, I give it a hopeful 8...... the hope being that it will become similar, to the excellent and much too short lived ""The Newsroom"".As opposed to the completely ridiculous ""See"", The Morning Show can actually become a hit for Apple.Bring on the story.Edit:Having just completed watching the Season 1 Finale, I am now calling this show an unmitigated hit, and amending my score to a 10.If this is handled right, it could be the ""TV land West Wing"", that ""The Newsroom"" never got a fair chance to be.Every single character on the show has developed beautifully, on uneven arcs that come together perfectly in the season finale, while the general story has very elegantly acted, as the vehicle for the development throughout the season.Great story, great production quality, great acting, great score, etc.I'm calling it now: Best new TV drama of 2019.Edit2:During season 2, I kind of felt the show was going a bit off the boil, getting a bit stagnant, and the main characters started to engage with each other less and less, and instead live in their own separate storylines, which annoyed me a bit, since the season 1 chemistry was so great, and the show was starting to feel disjointed.That is, until I had watched the season 2 finale.HOLY CRAP.No spoilers - but depending on the outcome of the final scene, to be revealed in season 3, the show is absolutely back on track, with the season finale possibly being one of the most riveting of any TV show, in recent memory.I will still be watching in season 3.",10
"Went from excellent to boring to excellent again!","The first season was intriguing, fast paced, and with interesting characters. I binged it in a matter of days. I loved the dynamic amongst the main male and female characters as well as the dichotomy between the veterans and the newbie. Reese Witherspoon's innocence was captivating. Great season one finale, so naturally I was excited about season two....
The first four episodes of season 2 dragged.....but I'm glad I persevered. The second season really picked up with the 5th episode. They dealt with some difficult topics that other shows shy away from for fear of antagonizing the viewers. The Morning Show deals with them head on! Bravo!Then, on a totally different level, I do not understand what Jennifer Aniston has done to her once beautiful face. It's not age. It's the excessive use of botox and fillers that has ruined her face. She looks perpetually swollen and startled! What's wrong with wrinkles? They're beautiful.One caveat: If her face is swollen due to medically needed oral steroids, then I understand. Otherwise, a naturally aging face is very graceful.",9
"Well written, accurate portrayal of metoo situations","Apart from the fairly realistic corporate power exchange (backstabbing and creating useful alliances etc), the violated female victim situation is incredibly well portrayed- such a highly delicate and complex emotional experience, both explored in the views of the victim and the perpetrator. Amazing and well done. Men who don't understand why women don't ""fight harder"" for help, watch this.",10
"Season 2, Episode 7","This pitiful series did an immediate nose-dive at Season 2, Episode 7. What a bunch of narcissistic crap. It was a bit fun at the beginning of the series with reese Witherspoon but it just digs itself into a hole. Garbage.",10
"Well Done Apple!","The show captures the the complexities of such an intensely debated topic as the MeToo movement with extreme sensitivity & provide different thought provoking perspectives. I was hooked from the very first episode and the season finale blew me away. Excellent production, superb acting by main & supporting cast & a powerful script.
A must watch",9
"Excellent dialogue, writing + acting!","Excellent dialogue, writing + acting!TV is SOOO good the last several years ... the Newsroom was AMAZING - it has been missed.But this - this is fresh and new and Steve Carell's character (Mitch) is absolutely daunting.",10
"The Morning Show is excellent!","The Morning Show is a brave story about the narrative of the abuser and the victims, each one's truth and in conclusion, how we all been complices of the culture of abuse. Excellent portrayal of the complexity of workplace sexual abuse. Not all sexual trauma is overtly aggressive and violent (which is often portrayed in films). All awful of course. But this show really highlights the implications of power. Simply impressive, I can't wait for the next chapter! And ... OMG! I love Jennifer Aniston and especially Reese Witherspoon who is still so wonderful (Jennifer gets the best role in her career). Thanks Apple TV !",6
"If you like political propaganda","Holy smokes - how do I describe this. I enjoyed the first season, nearly completely, but the second season was oddly a division of fairly impartial story telling and propaganda. Season three was a complete political and social propaganda washout and a huge disappointment. I found myself skipping ahead for most of the second and third seasons due to the predictable and boring content. My question to the producers - what happened between season one and two and three that would cause you to change course from story telling to preaching? You diverted from the original intriguing story to trash in season two and three.",10
"Cory and his mother","Last night's episode, with Bradley witnessing Cory and Mother, was, for me, a modern scene from A Lion in Winter. I saw the interaction, conversation, starting, making some assumptions, and then those were ripped asunder. I believe I saw two people who deeply connected and yet were filled, because of it, with loathing.Save the Cat, and The Hero's Journey map the usual, expected paths most stories take. As with a joke, I can be drawn into being invested in a scene but having seen so many, I can sometimes predict exactly what will be said or done next. Sometimes that's fine as long as I'm not bored. I believe I can tell when the writers are enthusiastic, really working. I can certainly tell when they are just cranking out product. The last seasons of Twin Peaks and Game of Thrones, are my examples. I pray for many more Morning Show episodes like last night's.",6
"Covid? REALLY?","I was thrilled about season 2 but started to lose interest as I moved forward with it. I still watched all of it though, and that is why I am writing this review.So much happens and yet there is no development on many issues as well as major plot holes poorly presented as coincidences.For instance, Mitch appears living in a mansion in Lake Como. We only learn that it is not his but a friend's only after his death (I'll come back to that later).During this seemingly tranquil and undercover exile one day he gets yelled at in the middle of the street by an american woman who happened to be in the same coffee shop and recognized him from meters away (really?), only to be defended by another by-passer who happened to be an almost-native-English-speaking-with-barely-an-Italian-accent woman, who just happened to be a filmmaker of some sort, though we learn nothing further from her because it is inconsequential to the story.Mitch's death is another disappointment as well as anecdotic. Haven't we seen enough of the redeemed bad guy that after apologizing and making amends suffers an ""unexpected and tragic"" death? The only twist in this cliche is that the car accident had a suicidal yet unconvincing hint.After Mitch dies, everyone finds out except Alex who was travelling back from Italy and his ex-wife who was just sitting at home, so naturally Alex HAS to go from the airport to deliver the news. Are.you.kidding?Then, a memorial is held in what appears to be a fancy hotel ball room, WITHOUT THE BODY, yet the ex wife is there as well as random atendees plus som UBA executives. Alex arrives late, gives a speech in the middle of the floor (no mic or anything) and then storms off. Cool and normal.Last but not least, throughout the season we hear about the spread of Covid, first in China and then all over the world, as a build up to a ""shocking"" twist in the second last episode: Alex tests positive. From the on it all goes downhill, and it is not funny or dramatic (whichever it intended to be).Alex laying on the floor in her apartment feeling sick must be one of the mos pathetic season endings, with Chip coming to her rescue (is he in love with her or not?). The cherry on top of this sh***t cake is her giving a monologue on how serious and potentially deadly Covid is. As if by now any of us is unaware of that.There are other plot holes and severe inconsistencies that I can only assume (and hope) that will be solved or dealt with in Season 3, otherwise Season 2 would be just a waste of time. For instance, what is the deal with Stella? What happened to Yanko? What happened with Laura and Bradley? Is Cory in love with Bradley? What happened with Maggie Brenner and her book who had everyone so scared and anxious?Finally, a note to the script writers of TMS and any following or ongoing TV show: we do NOT want or need to have more Covid-related plots or angles. We watch TV to escape from the pandemic, so please no more actors wearing masks and having Zoom meetings. There is simply no need.",2
"Season One- So much potential- Season Two- wow what a bomb.","Season One was current and interesting. It ended on a high note of rebellion and standing up for what was right. Season two totally backtracked and ruined it all. Now it is just a high priced, famous people playing over the top characters in a freaking network soap opera. You have all seen this before. I am out.",10
"S2 Is horible","The whole season is an absolute failure. I barely watched the last episode because it was boring, as well as the whole season. The first season was almost perfect, fantastic, I was so looking forward to the second season and now I can't believe what I saw. It took you two years for this? What a failure!",10
"A great show with two great actresses","Well, I'm not surprised at all when you have talent like Reese Witherspoon. You expect a wonderful performance and she delivers. But the true wonder is Jennifer Aniston. She gives a standout performance as Alex the main character who wakes up one morning to find that her life has imploded by her on air partners involvement in the ""Me Too"" movement. Alex handles everything situation wonderfully and Jennifer the actress makes each scene look so easy the way she navigates the emotions is superb. I always loved Jen. Thought she was a fine actress and was wasted on some projects she's done in the past. I hope people will finally see how versatile she is and not just another beautiful blonde. What these two women are trying to do with this show is remarkable, kudos to them both. An an honorable mention to Martin Short who came across as creepy and disgusting. Good job Marty. Excellent show. Worth watching!",9
"superb off-the-charts production values, cast, but still trouble lurking in paradise","On the plus side, the production values are so strong that, in comparison, similar hit shows like, for example, Mrs Maisel, look like they were scripted in a cafeteria and performed by high school students. Anniston gives the performance of her life, and Cruddup steals every scene not already nailed down. Entertaining as heck. The dark side, of course, is the subliminal messaging which, in spite of the writers' best efforts, is as subtle as a knee to the groin. If you are polished and good-looking, it is ok to pretend to want to hang with the common folk each morning, as if you were one of them. Even though you clearly are not. Legacy media -- this is the thrust of E10, the finale -- are now and always will be the good guys because, unlike Social Media, they fact-check everything. And key events, like the ""6JAN"" fiasco, are bad-bad-bad, and must-must-must be vilified at every possible opportunity, so even children yet to be born will grasp that unassailable and self-evident fact. It is a pretty picture, brilliantly executed. But still just a picture. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

"Really enjoying this","Firs three episodes have been entertaining and it's refreshing watching a show that feels like it is written for adults. It's also great watching show that covers political topics of the day without being biased.",10
"Great start.","Acting is great with interesting characters. Topical issues without skewing too left or right on issues presented.",10
"Episode 1","The cast, the writing, the acting it's all amazing!! I have been hooked since the first episode. Steve Carell is brilliant, Jennifer Aniston is unstoppable and Reese Witherspoon is sensational, Martin Short was a pleasant surprise!! Reese and Jennifer are a dynamic duo!! Who knew since their days as sisters in Friends!! The depth of Aniston's character is unlike any role I've ever seen her in, she's not Rachel, or any other Character she's been prior. It's the first role where you forget she's acting. Jennifer has always embraced her characters, but Alex is so effortless for her it's like she's her true alter ego.I did not know I would enjoy this series as much as I have. It's a drama that hits all the marks, like a great book that you just can't put down and you just have to find out what happens next!!",6
"Took a down turn","Season 1 was absolutely terrific. However, something went horribly wrong in season 2. Not sure if they had some different writers or what. The story line sucked. The way it was filmed looked cheesy and completely different. Even the music used in season 2 was bad. I gave season 1 a rating of 9. Season 2 probably a 5.... And that's ONLY b/c of the cast! I would have stopped watching under normal circumstances.",9
"Love this show","Honestly i'm really hoping they have a season 3, i would say 9 stars for season 1 and 8.5 for season 2, great at adapting to the pandemic to write Covid into the TV show and film, reminds me of the early days when we didn't know what to expect. I wish lead Actors weren't getting paid so much but they are amazing in this show. I'm normally into fantasy/science fiction so this is not what I would normally watch but for this to score so well means it's good af.",9
"Learn from Schitts Creek","The first series of TMS was great! The second series - doh! Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy use of the gay couple theme - these writers need to look to Schitts Creek to see how to introduce something like this. Writers of TMS have all the subtly of a sledgehammer. Why can't at least two episodes be used to warm the theme up - get people considering the possibilities of this relationship before the writers throw the couple into bed together! Really has knocked my enjoyment of this show which I first thought was very well done - but I am now grinding my teeth in annoyance at the hamfistedness of it all. What a shame...",7
"Second season...eh","The characters seems to have changed personalities.and sometimes seem almost one liner ish in their dialogue. Also, does every single conversation anyone and everyone has on this show have to be so high intensity shouting drama this is so important end of the world screaming cursing back stabbing high strung drama?!?!?!Lord it has gotten old. Everyone is one dimensional now and I don't even know what all the screaming is about. But these people I could care less what happens now they're all so one dimension and self centered and out of touch.",5
"Words cannot describe how much I love this show.","If you are considering watching this show, do yourself a favor and watch it. It is superb. The acting is so good. TMS reminded me why I love Reese and Jennifer so much. Perfect casting. Aniston and Witherspoon blew me away. Apple is going to provide quality original content. I am so proud of the leading ladies. Unbelievable performance.",10
"S1 9/10, S2 5/10 S3 9/10","So pleased I stuck with this series after the disappointing S2.S3 is excellent again, very fine drama playing clearly on Elon Musk and the games billionaires play.I love it how the stories of the main characters intertwine around corporate game playing, the aftermath of January 6th and the ambitions of the key players.Also wonderful to see Stephen Fry appear and doing what he does so well: play the arrogant Englishman.Aniston's character Alex Levy again swings between her unbridled ambition and her actually caring about other people.The tensions rise high with the future of the network on the line leading to a wonderful, and personal, apotheosis.Watch it.And now, I want to see S4..",8
"Well researched and written behind the scenes headline type drama that's bold, brash, and provocative!","""Apple TV"" has really hit a home run with this series ""The Morning Show"" as the drama is full of life like twist and turns involving central characters as it goes behind the scenes showcasing a spotlight on both their personal and private lives. As a viewer you see the work and preparation each day of how things go at a national news network as the reporters and anchors are always out on the field covering the best and most interesting stories, many hot button issues along the way something more lies with each. The acting and cast chemistry is super tag team news dream duo was lead by Alex Levy( a fine turn from Jennifer Aniston) who 's super hot and looks fine and melted in front of the camera, and top anchor man Mitch Kessler(Steve Carell) who's world comes crashing down once a scandal is revealed involving him.Later it's soon revealed that many more dirty skeletons were present in closets at the network as it was a company that had a toxic work environment. In a good supporting and wild card like turn enter young eager small town reporter Bradley Jackson(awesome work from Reese Witherspoon) who's a new fresh informative face who rocks the network boat even more.One may can relate this series to present day headlines and compare it to other real life scandals also still the series is interesting, entertaining and compelling a great drama that shows the highs and lows of both private and work life as they both mix for crazy drama. Watch the ""Morning show"" it's highly enjoyable and entertaining as it's story keeps you eyes glued in the meantime it searches for truth and exposes secrets.",9
"Mind blown","I honestly had lower expectations for this series. First episode? Okay.
As episodes went on the quality quickly escalate and all I have left to say is that I cannot wait for season 2 to come already. There are so many issues that have been addressed without them being avoided or rerouted. A gem. Deserves every award it's been nominated for.",10
"I had forgotten how brilliant Jennifer Aniston is...","I am enjoying the show. The story is interesting and JA is just brilliant. Reese Witherspoon also does very well as an outspoken journalist. I am excited for the upcoming episodes.",10
"Season 3!","Oh my goodness! I have loved this show from the beginning but it is only getting better. 8/10 for season one & two but 10/10 for season three and nine of the stars goes to Billy Crudup!!! 🙌🏻 Amazing performance! Can't wait to watch more - hope there will be more seasons to come! Also outstanding performances by Witherspoon and the entire cast, but Crudup is on fire!!! 😍Well written script and clever twists. Even if you know the twists are coming, you love them when they show up. Addressing present and real issues within the storyline also makes it super interesting to watch. But please Crudup - stay for at least season four! 🔥Love from Sweden.",10
"WAS great","The first season was amazing: intense, compelling, really tight writing. The second season is falling apart halfway through. All the characters have become unlikable, and not in an interesting, neurotic, self-loathing kind of way (eg., Succession). They've just become more self-absorbed, tedious, vindictive and out of control. The dialogue often goes nowhere and seems irrelevant. The show has decided to focus on the excesses and superficiality of political correctness and identity politics which I think is a worthy topic to explore. I just wish the characters made sense. Lots of accomplished, highly paid professionals with anger issues. One can't really feel sorry for them.",7
"Sometimes uneven, but still very well done","Season 1 was excellent, season 2 not so much, and season 3 was pretty good. I'll review season 3 here, since seasons 1 and 2 have been reviewed ad nauseam.Season 3 centers around the possible acquisition of the channel by a billionaire (played quite well by John Hamm) who is an obvious stand-in for Elon Musk, but without the weirdness. In this universe, he is just a typical, ruthless capitalist.There is much drama, obviously, and you'll have to watch to see what happens, but I overall enjoyed it. New characters are introduced, and they tend to be intriguing. New alliances are formed, some quite surprising. It's definitely worth a watch.",8
"Lowered my initial rating after season 2","Season 1 was Absolutely terrific. Great drama between the characters and the story writing was very good. Season 2 however was horrible! I rated S1 with a 9/10. S2 was. 4-5/10. I don't understand what happened. The story line sucked but also a few characters just seemed to be completely different from S1 in how they were portrayed. Writing was bad, but even the music used was bad compared to S1. Everything went down hill... I was so pumped for S2.... Now I think it should just end and lost all confidence in the writers to get back on track.",6
"WTF? Season One = 10; Season Two = -1","What has happened to this show?We are witness to the greatest quality drop off in a series from season 1 to season 2 in the history of television.Season 1 had interesting conflicts and storylines.A timely topic of workplace sexual harassment.A dynamic season closing episode.Season 2 has one reason to watch and one only. Billy Crudup.Everything else seems aimless and wandering with stand-alone episodes to fulfill the woke checklist.",1
"Engaging and great acting!","I watched all three episodes and I was genuinely surprised how this show is engaging. Cant say that Im surprised how good acting is by Reese and Jennifer, cuz I saw a lot of their work thru the years.One big plus, for Apple TV plus ;)",10
"best show of 2019","Honestly this show is the peak of 2019, the last episode left me overwhelmed with emotions, great acting, great scenario, great music and great filming, at first it was compared to ""See"", honestly, ""See"" is awful compared to this AMAZING series.
Witherspoon and Aniston work was remarkable, I cant watch it again because i cant handle the epicness of this show one more time, BEST SHOW IN 2019.",10
"I loved it","It is a masterpiece, I loved this show. Bradley copper is the best",10
"love this show.","I have no idea what everyone is complaining about. I thought that both season were equally good and even thought the second one was better. Season 2 doesn't deserve all the hate, it's an compelling story with admirable acting.After reading some of the other reviews I've noticed the pattern of not liking the second season due to the Bradley/Laura storyline. As a queer person I appreciated the representation and loved having Julianna Margulies as a lesbian again.More on the show as a whole, I was very entertained and there wasn't really an instance when I got bored. The first season always had me on my toes which isn't something typically said about a drama show but it is true.I do recommend watching the morning show, it has terrific writing and superb acting.",10
"Relationship b/w sinning and redemption in the #MeToo era","The series beautifully showcases the delicate balance between sinning, evolution and redemption. With #MeToo movement as the foreground, it captures the complicity and ignorance and pretence of all stakeholders of uba with conviction and intelligence. It trusts the audience's power of understanding by throwing open the premise of Mitch's cry for absolution, Alex's confusion about her extent of involuntary complicity, purity of Bradley's moral compass and seemingly reckless/dating steps of Cory with are intact revolutionary. Absolutely love the way Mitch's character was treated. The show is an excellent testament to the show's female creators. My first review on IMDb and I'm glad it is for this show. We definitely need more female creators like Mimi Leder. Looking forward to watch her other productions.",10
"Amazing cast, Billy Crudup is a GEM","So, all the actors, in part, absolutely make this show. They are all excellent. It's especially great to see Aniston in this role and see her really show what she's capable of. I especially love the dynamic between her and Mark Duplass. I adore him and they play off each other really well. Reese is great, as usual. I appreciate the edge of her character. It plays well with her perky, little fireball thing she has always done well. My favorite of her characters have an edge. But crudup?? Wow. He's is absolutely incredible and the most fun to watch. I'm excited every time he's onscreen. I can't comment about the second season, as I've only seen the first. But the first is awesome. Constant twists and turns and the tension always building. They have tackled the heavy subject matter very well and have been excellent at showing the complexity. From both sides. I highly recommend this one. Iss extremely binge-able. I got through the first season in two days.",8
"Excellent cast can't save this show from itself","Great cast and the makings of a good story slowly descend into a mawkish, preachy mess.The writers need to get out of their own way and trust that the audience is smart enough to understand the messages through the story and acting. Instead, they use clunky exposition and tired tropes to explicitly state every moralistic stance. It feels like an Ayn Rand novel--wooden characters acting out a morality play to batter an audience into submission. There is so much potential here, but it's drowning in Hummel figurines and Geraldine Ferraro pins.I honestly agree with most of the points the show makes, but it's just so overdone. Hopefully the writers can back off and let the story breathe in season 4.",6
"Emmy award next","This is for sure my favorite tv show! The acting is spectacular, you really feel what they do. I love that Jen is back strong after a long time only doing movies, and she is awesome in drama shows. We want to se her do more of it! Resse as always is the greatest actress in earth she shine by herself. I really got impress about the acting of Gugu mbatha (Hannah) she is a strong actress and I love to se her more in this type of movies and tv shows. This show is totally worth to watch.",10
"Enough with Covid","Season 1 was amazing. Season 2 not so much. Why do these producers not understand we all lived/are living through Covid. We don't want to watch shows that play back the events.",6
"What happened?","The first season was absolutely incredible. Emotional, funny, and gripping. And then came the second season; and it was like when a canceled show is rebooted and the writers are struggling to explain where the characters left off and what they've been ""up to.""It went in a completely different, confusing directionIt's disappointing, I was very much looking forward to the new season, and it just made the show convoluted.The cast is incredible, Billy Crudup especially, and the potential seems wasted now. I'll give it another watch and see if I can get into it, because I really want to like it.",5
"Boy this was harsh!","When I started the Morning Show I wasn't really sure what to expect, but what I found was definitely a surprise.From the start the different behind the scene staff working in the Morning Show team seemed quite confusing, but what was soon evident was that everyone had their own agenda, and it was a toxic cut-throat environment to be working in. I can't help but wonder whether this kind of thing is anything even close to being how things are in the 'actual' tv world?I enjoyed every episode and Mitch Kessler's character was really quite abhorrent. Hope Stave Carrell managed to find a comedy role to play after this, as both this and the last film I saw him in (The Way Way Back) he's been quite horrid.Morning Show is definitely worth a go, Jennifer Aniston and Reece Witherspoon both played great roles and Billy Cudrup an even better one. I've rarely seen any other tv character as smarmy, smug and oily as his Cory Ellison.Can't wait for series 2.",8
"Brilliant","Brilliant show dealing with relevant themes and showing the lengths people go to protect themselves. Loved the ending",10
"Love this show!","The perfect cast to tell the story of women in entertainment and the sexism they endure.",10
"Simply Amazing","What a great show. Well done characters with an intriguing story and surprising plot twists.",10
"1s Finale","Excellent season finale! What a great ending! I'm excited for the Season 2.",10
"So good I see why it was nominated","Just from a little bit of it I can tell I'll love this show. Astonishing cast I'm surprised the ones nominated didn't win! I absolutely love Mark Duplass I wish I could meet him, he's even a producer of a documentary series On Tour with Aspergers which I love. Anyway the drama/acting is impeccable; I should've seen this sooner!",10
"Would be better w/o Jennifer Anniston","Superb cast & acting, and love all characters except Anniston. She acts with her hair and in every event she manages the same reaction-a suck of air, a heavy sigh and a grasp to her stomach.",7
"Already hooked!","This is a great show that's been perfectly casted with great writing and solid performances. Rating this any lower than 6 baffles me. Can't wait to watch the rest!",8
"I liked it, Until I Didn't","I enjoyed the first season a lot. Liked the characters, actors, story line, sense of tension, the works. But practically the whole season was leading up to the Big Event that never took place. There's an explanation, but it was still a let-down, a non-event. I tried the second season but turned it off after one episode. Didn't care anymore.",7
"Season 1 was great, season 2 is dreadful","I'm not sure what happened here. SE1 was excellent with great writing and pacing but SE2 is just terrible. It's like the woke brigade have arrived and now every character is shallow and everyone is just shouting and generally being obnoxious.The most recent episode with the mediocre white men line? Wow - so brave and edgy. Try saying that about any other group and see what happens.What's going on America? You are truly losing your way - it's so sad to see.",1
"Do not listen to the haters","This has to be one of the best written, best acted, and just overall, the best series ever.From the first season one episode to the last season three episode, this had my attention. Luckily, I was able to the three seasons as a whole. Each episode drew me into the next, Bill Crudup, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Anniston, really the entire cast, are amazing in their talent. The story line follows what is happening in the world, and behind the scenes in real life with blinders off.I cannot wait to see season four as I am sure it will be even better than the previous three.This series does not hold back.",10
"... revised judgment now does it stay permanent","... a whopping 83% of 66K IMDb voters have rated it 8 or above... S1 had ups-downs yet overall it's been-fun-watching... S2 one episode in is nothing like its predecessor... it's boring start to finish... as all life has gone out of the characters... they all look-act very tired just going-through-motions... plot-script tedious... there's still what's left of the season to recover... going back watching S1 E1 again.. that spark's what's missing.. now is what's happened to remain fatal... upcoming S2 episodes to tell... watched it again.. better 2nd viewing revised judgment... now to keep things going.",8
"Thought-provoking Brilliance","This show was funny and serious. Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Billy Cudrup, Steve Carrell, and Mark Duplass were all amazing. This showed a well-balanced view of the complexity of workplaces, especially environments in entertainment where people work together in a much more casual atmosphere, travel to locations, and spend extreme amounts of time together. It tackled the #MeToo Movement without being preachy or black and white about it. It had thought-provoking storylines involving sexual harassment, sexual consent, sexual relationships, romance, power, friendship, privacy, and human behavior. It shows so many sides of this gray area issue. Change and progress is important, but in some cases, there aren't easy answers to how to accomplish this and The Morning Show demonstrated that.",10
"A must watch! Amazing storytelling and acting","I can't believe it took me so long to watch this show, but I'm so glad I did! The eerie parallels with the Today show are so apparent. Really pulls back the curtain on Hollywood, the ""networks"" and old school boys club. Jennifer Aniston shines as Alex! I mean she's amazing in this role, her best yet. Deserves an award not just a nom. Mark Duplasses is great! He's always so good, I wish he was in more shows/movies. Reese kills it as always. I never thought I could dislike Michael Scott (Steve Carroll) but man do I hate Mitch Kessler... shows how well Steve Carroll played the role.Deserves more awards than they've gotten or lack of. Hollywood is clearly not ready to validate and celebrate the truth.Highly recommend!!!My thoughts...The despicable things that have happened and probably are still happening in Hollywood need to be stopped and these men need to be held accountable. It's horrendous that these men in power use women for sex and then try to turn it on them as using them to get ahead, because of their cover up. Then all the backstabbing and power/chess moves by executives. Makes for great tv but a bad work culture.",10
"SEASON 3 - back to form!","One of the few cases where the showrunner change...worked!After a disappointing second season, season 3 was simply addictive.Best thing for this show is not take itself too seriously...it's a well written, soapy, guilty pleasure.This season was never boring, smart, fresh and sexy.The cast is excellent and they worked really well as an ensemble. Crudp, Aniston and Lee were may personal standouts.Casting Jon Hamm was a brillant and chemistry with Aniston was amazing.Nicole Beharie had a small role but she wasn't wasted: the episode centered on her and Holland Taylor's character was a serious standout.Hope they get all the awards attention they deserve.",9
"OMG","This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review here. I like lots of shows, but this is unbelievable. The nuances of showing all the sides of a story is fantastically handled. And Jennifer Aniston is a national treasure in this. Completely captivating and will have you thinking for a long time.",10
"Slow start ....get great then crashes in season 2","A slow build in season 1 but the last few episodes of seasons 1 are fantastic- tense , dramatic and powerful.Season 2 .... Meandering and tension free. Character development misfires.",7
"Welcome back Jennifer","Saw all three episodes and Aniston is having her best role yet. It's meaty, and at the same time emotional, she will carry this series through. Witherspoon has not reached the peak but I'm hopeful she will hit the right spot the remaining episodes and we have hit not seen the best of Steve Carell yet, the best thing on TV right now.",10
"Second Review Billy Cruddup","Billy Cruddup is the star of this show, he delivers a really interesting character both funny and disturbing, his dialogue sparkles, into Series 2 now and the storyline is depending more and more on him to keep me involved, Witherspoon is becoming annoying and Anniston is a bit predictable, he's the highly polished chaos factor that keeps adding interest.",7
"Oh dear! What happened to S2","No idea what happened here. S1 was decent, not amazing but pretty good. S2 on the other hand, they've completely thrown it all out. Characters have changed personality, plot has gone, the lot. Great characters like Cory, have turned into 1dimensional jelly.The whole woke agenda in S2 is so over-blown, it's shouted so loud, so in your face you wonder if there's going to be some amazing twist about it all. It's way over the top, most recently with the line ""I'm sick of mediocre white-men"". I can't figure out if the show is trying to be clever and has something up it's sleeve or if it really is just trying to be as offensive as possible. Trouble is, it's so un-subtle, so heavy handed I can't see how it can be part of a wider plot.I just don't know where it's going with any of it. It's all a bit of a mess really.",3
"Liked it despite myself...","I'm a woman and find the reverse sexism that has come out since the metoo movement is a bit disturbing/embarrassing. I've been sexually harassed and not spoke up years ago. Alternately, I've slept with an older ma and been the seducer. It like how the show supports the movement, gives some space to imagine that Mitch is just a philanderer more than a predator (like Martin Short's character). Men like Mitch seem to be the collateral damage. And maybe we are entering or should enter a time where you can't sleep with coworkers for any reason. Either sex. It's just too risky.
Anyway, getting off topic but I thought this would be a cringe worthy show but it's really drawn me and my husband in.
We discuss the problems/possible solutions to this never ending complex work/relationship environment we all have to survive in.
Very enjoyable show. Steve Carroll is awesome... Aniston is surprisingly good, even though I don't like her character... she plays it perfectly. Witherspoon is dead on - really great.
Definitely watch / starts getting good a couple episodes in. Can't wait to see it play out",9
"Gripping","Aniston has to be one of the most sorely underrated actors of her generation. She devestates in every single scene of this. Everyone is seamless, in fact. This is a welcome breath of fresh, realistic air in a TV world filled with supernatural claptrap and superhero dross. OK so I've only seen episode one but I have nothing negative to say about it. Bingeworthy indeed.Now on episode three, this is really becoming something special. Using drama to debate the sides of me-too really exposed the naivety and entitlement of the toxic male, but it's never preachy and never expositional. The writing is supremely intelligent and witty, the casting perfect and the acting gobsmacking. This is a real TV gem which could stand out as my favourite show of the decade.",10
"Jen personal best already","Jennifer Aniston is my childhood idols since Friends. Did watch her movie and production on n off. The challenge of this drama is she acts as a Tv boardcasting news host which is strong, determined as well as a victims from her partner scandal. But the way her look just can't fit in the story background. I'm Jen fans but sorry she still only the Jen in comedy. I think the deterministic character is what she lack of and that's inborn and can't change. Somehow I thought Reese act on Jen role probably more appropriate. But honestly, it's her personal best on screen.
The story firstly is about crisis management and opportunity then it's about revealing company dark side of staff manipulation. It's quite interesting to see the collaboration in the later part of staff to disclose the dirty truth. Something won't happen in reality. Story itself I give a 9.",8
"Powerful","From the get go this show is real and powerful and you will have goosebumps through every episode. It'll make you feel so many feelings, especially anger!!!! And that finale!!!! 👍👍👍",8
"Soo real...","In the late 80s I worked on AM Los Angeles, a front runner for Good Morning America with 2 women on it Christina Ferrari and Tawny Little. This show brings back so many memories and really shows how behind the scenes everything is not what you think. Also with the verdict of Weinstein the storyline couldn't be more Su courant. Last but not least Ive never been a fan of Jennifer Aniston but she is amazing in this",10
"A great series about an important topic","I'm a straight male. I agree 100% with the ideas in this show. It's realistic. It's believable. The characters are multilayered. I never expected such quality from an Apple series, but here we are. If you think this show is about politics and agendas clearly you've never lived in the real world and interacted with real people (which are, surprise(!) capable of being as complex as yourself). Great show. Better writing. Loved it.",8
"A well told and brilliantly acted emotional rollercoaster","It doesn't rush things. It's well and slow paced, the story is great at the amount of emotional psychology they use is fantastic. I read a lot of mixed feelings around this and came into it with prejudice. After about 30 min in the first episode I was sold. The story is solid! I feel that a lot of shows now a days cast women to even things out. The result is often mediocre end result because they haven't thought it well through (Just to clarify, I'm not saying it would be better with a man. There's a language barrier here..). Well look no further. This have to be the best show in a long time where the amount of details is amazing. Not speaking of set design, but human emotions. The series is emotionally turbulent, well told, brilliantly produced and the acting. My God. Anniston hello!!!",6
"Excellence","Incredible show. First off, the music by Carter Burrell (Fargo) is absolute top notch. Secondly, this show is true art because it represents true people and the complexity of dramatic situations we are experiencing. To that point, by the end (spoilers), you are left feeling like what Mitch did wasn't that big of a deal and everybody needs to relax while at the same time feeling like what he did was truly horrible and must be stopped. This ability for you to experience the different perspectives and feel the complexity of the situation makes this true art. Very impressed.",10
"Season 2 ugh!","Why are we getting so political in season 2? I want to escape the drama.... Not watch politely agendas - I'm done- won't be watching anymore. Seasonn1 was fantastic- was very excited about the second season til I got about 4 episodes in.",6
"Bordering on the edge of unrealistic and nonsensical","Does any of this stuff really happen? The producers , who also happen to be the lead actors,are making the plot unfathomable . Also Steve Carell is a great actor and needs more airtime!",3
"Coulda Been A Contender","Some terrific acting and a pretty good if predictable story stuck with some of the worst writing in a long time for a marquee show. Whole dialogues and scenes are constructed for the sole purpose of conveying Information that the characters would already know, like the nature of the business they're all in or what one-dimensional stereotype they represent.. Nails on a blackboard. But, oh my, Billy Crudup, as always, delivers magic; Jennifer A is nuanced and deep and riveting; and Steve Carrell somehow manages to steal it from them both with a steely, fearless performance of a very unlikeable, self-righteous victim. Well into Episode 1, I did not expect to continue to Episode 2, but the acting hooked me.",9
"Written by the Twitter generation","First off,.....excellent casting. Lots of high quality actors bringing their A game. Season One's plot and writing around the MeToo movement was awesome, 10 out of 10. Season Two looked to be about COVID from the beginning but was peppered with too much identity politics for my taste. 6 out of 10. I am looking forward to Season 3 and hope they focus on COVID with something uplifting coming out of the Kessler situation.",8
"I can't remember a show with a more perfectly picked cast of actors for non-fiction characters.","9.5/10 🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌌
I believe the casting directors for this series have absolutely without a doubt achieved the highest degree of perfection with every selection they've made for each role. I don't think people realize how strenuous and exhausting a non-fiction big production can become especially when it entails dark comedy but selecting the right chemistry of characters to portray actual real life people or events along with the most important factor which is entertaining the audience should not be overlooked. I've been waiting for this series and I never expected for it to be this good but I will say I hate iphones they have nothing on my Samsung Note+ but when it comes to the shows on AppleTV ""SEE"", ""The Servant"", and now ""The Morning Show"" are undoubtedly in my top ten of best TV series I've watched in the past half decade. This is what I consider must see TV.",9
"Fantastic lee greatest","Wow that doesn't even justify it how I feel about this show. This series is very fantastic and GREAT!!. One of the reasons why I thank this series is so great is because of how realistic it and I think that is fantastic they used real life news stories and make they characters deal with it I absolutely love what the show is about!. I also think it is cool and interesting how they go be behind the scenes and show you what like a news anchor and what famous and fortune can do a person I thank is fantastic . The cast is great add jonh hum is awesome easy to see why this is the mostly popular on Apple tv!",8
"How Was I Sleeping on this Show?!?!?","This has to be one of the best ensemble of actors that I have EVER SEEN!!! They all deserve Oscars for their performance!! The crazy thing about it, as that both My Wife and I had passed on the show, after only having watched the pilot episode for a few minutes. However, as a result of positive feedback she had noted, we decided to give it a second try, and became hooked! Jennifer Aniston's and Reese Witherspoon's interpretation and expression of the characters were simply flawless! I continue to be amazed by Steve Carrel's scope and breadth when it comes to acting. The guy is simply amazing. The crown, though, has to go to Gugu Mbatha-Raw!! In just as few episodes, in particular Episode 10 she delivers such an open, raw and gut-wrenching performance! If there is anyone to deserve ALL the accolades, it was her. I was sobbing, uncontrollably, thru her delivery. It was more than believeable, but painfully authentic! Kudos to the entire Team! I am indeed hooked!",10
"This show is absolutely amazing with a good plot and storytelling","What are wrong with critics these days? People these days don't understand the fact that there is never a perfect show. People have different tastes and I understand if some people don't like it. But, the fact that most reviewers saying that this show doesn't have a plot seem like they have been payed to hate on it.
In my opinion, this show has a really great storyline with a wonderful cast to deliver it, and please don't listen to those negative reviews. Give this show a try and I promise you, you will love it and see the potential for season two.",9
"From great to good to blah","The magic seems to have left with Steve Carrell's exit.This show had a lot of promise in its first season. It seemed to be introducing you to characters with depth and interesting personal stories to share. The writing felt smarter and more nuanced. You had the feeling you were dealing with smart writers who knew how to thread the ""woke"" needle with the reality one. And that's a refreshing thing to see in Hollyweird.Season 2 wasn't as intriguing as the first season but it was still a fun experience. You felt like the writers were laying the groundwork for a long journey with these characters and this story.But season 3 shortened the ride. The juice seems to be gone. The subject matter feels dated and it's depressing (NO ONE wants to relive the pandemic or the hysteria surrounding Jan 6). Beyond that, the writers seem to have ditched Jennifer Anniston's character's entire personal story (where is her daughter?) in favor of Reese's character lesbian affair and the producer lady's random relationship with an independent photographer we've never seen before. Not a great trade-off. And it doesn't have to be stated that whenever Hollyweird tries to cover political events nowadays, they fail miserably. They can't help but insult a wide swath of the audience. I had thought this show was smarter than that but season 3 proves otherwise.I am therefore not sure if I desire to stick it out with this show or even with the remainder of this season 3. Whereas it seemed different and layered before, now it feels banal and dry. I find that I feel labored now when deciding if I want to watch a new episode; it's more like a chore (finish what you start) than real anticipation and excitement. Sad that only 3 seasons in, I'm thinking this might need to be the show's last. *sigh*",6
"One of best dramas in the century","The Morning Show is one of the best dramas in the century but this doesn't stop there. This show opens the eyes of the viewer by giving you a new perspective to the world and the news industry. This show also tackles a very sensitive feminist issue beautifully and helps you understand what happens to women on a daily basis working in corporate sectors or any sector really! How they tackle the reality of this harsh world is worth inspiring from. This show is not just a show, it's a mutual feeling that no one has talked about is coming in a form of an approximately 10-hourlong web series.",10
"Decent show!","When I saw all the actors in this , I thought it would be comedy show. Not only was it not a comedy, it turned out to be a compelling drama. I think that whole #meetoo movement is BS but this made me look at it from a different angle. The acting is great, though Jennifer Aniston can be a bit over the top at times. I did find Reese Witherspoon character to be annoying, but then again, I always do. Steve Carell did a great transition of being sympathetic at first to being the complete opposite towards the end. And, may I just say, Billy Crudup is an absolutely amazing in this. He steals every single scene he is in. I look forward to season 2.",7
"Season 1 = 9 season 2 = 1","I absolutely loved season 1. Found both roles for Jennifer and Reese interesting and easy to watch. However season 2 the writers destroyed both characters. Jennifer was turned into someone that seemed to be bipolar and Reese into an insecure spoiled brat. If I wanted biopolar, I'd rewatch ""Homeland"" where it was intentional and extremely well acted. I struggled to stay with Season 2.",4
"This Series Has It All","There are no spoilers here I would highly recommend The Morning Show. I like to check out commenters before I watch a new series, and based on the stellar reviews, this doesn't disappoint. It is the most intriguing TV series I've seen in awhile. The Morning Show can only be seen on Apple TV and I agreed to the 7 day free trial and am glad I did. There are brilliant actors such as Reese Witherspoon, Billy Crudup, Steve Carell and Jennifer Aniston among others who raise the bar on the talent expected in a TV series. There are few, if any times where I say, about this show ""That just doesn't happen."" , I admit I give up quickly on a series if it seems hokey. I hate that I am a tough critic to please and wish I was more forgiving. This may seem a bit shallow to some but actor Nestor Carbonell who plays the ""sexy"" weatherman is so creepy to watch I fast forward as soon as I see his not at all ""sexy"" face. He wears more eyeliner than the woman on the show and when I saw him without a shirt I screamed at the screen. ""Ick! Put a shirt on!"" Gross. If anyone should be tagged ""sexy"" it is Billy Crudup who is one of the most enjoyable characters on the show and great looking. The show has an excellent way of taking your attention hostage and be prepared you will get addicted so set aside some time to watch. No regrets at all",10
"Must Watch","What a masterpiece of a show. Such nuanced storytelling of a very sensitive and contemporary subject matter. Everything of this show was intricately planned and perfected; from script to setting, from music to makeup, to editing, to everything else. The actors are beyond amazing. Jennifer Anniston was so impressive as Alex.Wow. Must watch.",10
"Outstanding","I am amazed at how Jennifer Aniston has matured as an actress. The show is excellent. Great script. Outstanding performances.",10
"Why should I see this?","A terrible bunch of product placement crab. Super terrible, super terrible people. They are all evil egomaniacs. What a waste of my time",8
"Too good to be real","I honestly can't get over this show, you can see the amount of work that has been put into it, from the casting to the storyline to that astonishing & thrilling ending, i cannot wait for the 2nd season, this show had absolutely made it to my top 10 favorite shows list, more people need to watch it.",10
"Compelling","One of the best drama series in years. The main stars are playing their characters perfectly. I love the character played by Billy Crudup and he executing beautifully. I hope the show will go on for several years; I'll cross my fingers.",10
"Brave...","I'm only writing this review in response to the only other review posted as of yet. One star is completely unrealistic. The writing deserves at least a six regardless of whether it agrees with your views.however I'm not sure the show deserves more than a six at this point it has some seemingly weak points. Taking on this topic is brave. Bravery can lead to disgrace or glory, it's a bit too early to decide which at this point.But one star is just ridiculous, that's essentially saying they would rather watch anything else and I seriously doubt that.",7
"Undeniably true to life","This show is completely riveting. Aside from the incredible writing, acting, directing, cinematography, it is an extremely accurate look at newsroom operations. And the cringe factor is undeniably true. Kudos to Aniston and Witherspoon for EP-ing this show that reveals the sad and bitter truth of the morning news industry - with its drama, power issues, back-biting and more. I would love love love to see them expand a future season to bring to audiences what happens in newsrooms abroad...which are crawling with the disease of #MeToo but where the rules of a America just don't apply.",10
"Overrated.","Overrated, uneven series. Unlikable characters (aren't we supposed to be rooting for someone? Or something?), endless scenes, overacting and a script riding the tide of the #metoo movement.",7
"Disappointing Season 2!","This show went from a good Season 1 to a horrible Season 2.Every episode of Season 2 is nothing but a ""everyone scream, cry, complain and act like a two year old"".In Season 2, NONE of the characters have an ounce of professionalism, class or ethics.Characters are all unlikeable in Season 2.We are tired of the wokeness and political bias.We are tired of Covid stories, we are looking for an escape.As others have said, I wish we could separate the reviews by Season on IMDB.",2
"A very enjoyable series on a dark subject matter","I loved this show so much. It's a very rewarding viewing experience and such a triumph in storytelling. It has dark and uncomfortable moments, but more than enough hilarious, gleeful comedy in its writing. Outstanding performances all around. I loved how the perpetrator was fully-fleshed out and we got to delve into his perspective. Marvellously played by Steve Carell.It must be noted that there were dialogues in the earlier episodes that made me cringe. Bradley Jackson can seem like a stereotype and some elements of her back story seems unnecessary and overwrought, but she does end up becoming our champion as we learn more about her. And the writing also reaches some insane peaks.A must-watch and the show that made me realise Apple TV was worth the money.",9
"Overall a great show but with a few downsides","The acting is great and it's one of the best roles of Jennifer so far, the scenes are well thought and it keeps you on the edge of what's next but the only thing that I kind of disliked is the fact that it's trying to get political. Although I must say that it's not like your average feminist Netflix trash , it gives a point but it doesn't drown you with it, you just get it smoothly and most of the times it's bearable but overall as a said, a great show, looking forward for season2.",8
"I like it, but....","First off let me say that the characters Stella, Daniel, and Greta are unlikeable, and annoying! They're rude and spiteful to anyone not their color, I'll leave it at that.The rest of the cast is great. I love Jennifer Anniston in just about everything she's done. Reese Witherspoon is amazing, Billy Crudup, Steve Carell, Mark Duplas, Julianna Margulies all great.Some episodes are rather slow building, but the writing is good enough that I stay interested.Right now I'm binge watching the second season, so I haven't seen the third season everyone's whining about yet.My favorite episode so far has the foo Fighters playing Making a Fire off their then new album Medicine at Midnight.We love Dave Grohl, and it was sentimental to see a quick glimpse of Taylor Hawkins,(RIP.)I'll keep watching unless it takes a dramatic turn for the worse.Well done Apple+",8
"Shut up and take my money.","Survive the first 1-2 episodes, and then enjoy one of the best TV Shows you will ever watch.
The music. The plot. The actings.
Outstanding job by AppleTV+.",9
"Just Amazing","This show is one of the best I've ever seen. Excellent cast, hysterically funny, and just a great story line. Billy Crudup is absolutely incredible in this role. If he doesn't receive an award for his performance I'd be shocked. He is my new favorite actor.",10
"Mimics the effects of an anxiety attack, but in a good way!","First of all, the casting. Holy crapoly, it's a fantastic cast. And then the story, well paced and on fire out of the gate. Really gets you hooked with gripping details and doesn't waste your time on fluff. And I'm pretty sure Cory's character is my favorite in all cinema history. I loved his character, and the actor did such a great job! And then there's the finale, that's where the anxiety attack symptoms come in lol The pieces of this story were woven together so well that it was delivered superbly in the end. You really have no way of knowing how it will end and you keep on your heels to try and guess it (unless you cheated with spoilers). So well done! I truly love this show! Well done, indeed!",10
"Watch if you want to feel bad","I have stuck with this sh it ow thru almost 2 seasons and through the good and bad, have never watched an episode and felt good afterword. I get that this is supposed to be uncomfortable drama but in the end it's just all around depressing and too ultimately uncomfortable to enjoy.",6
"Exceptional Acting!","A great new story mixed with some wonderful acting, especially from Billy Crudup. The characters are played well and they addressed all the controversial topics in a good and neutral way!
It had a slow start, but give it time and finish the first episode because I assure you that you will be hooked!",9
"Season 2 review","Season 1 had one specific plot point and knew what it wanted to be and kind of ended with a bang with multiple opportunities in stire. Season 2, however, tries to find it's new identity in current events, mainly the coronavirus. It's a lot like the following seasons of 13 Reasons Why; while the show handles metal issues recklessly, the first season at least had a format and a focus, the rest tried to tie loose ends.When this whole pandemic started, fans of Marvel Studios asked Kevin Fiege if they'd address the virus in their movies/series. Feige basically explained that people watch movies and shows to escape their current circumstances.I wish The Morning Show S2 made this same decision. Season 1 dabbled in political agendas a little bit, but it was self-aware and tried to uncover the layers of these complicated situations. Season 2 reminds viewers constantly about the severeness of COVID-19 and the importance of LGBTQ representation and it takes place of a lot of good character development.Though Cory is still my favorite character, somehow the writers made me like Mitch, the main problem of S1, much more than any of the main cast.Forcing current events and common trends into entertainment never works. Every time you see a Fortnite dance/reference in a movie, do you not roll your eyes? When Trump was in office, left or right, were you not affected in some way when it was brought up in your favorite show? That's why HBO's The Newsroom worked, it took place in the not-so-distant past, got a little political, and focused more on the story and sprinkled these events intermittently.Please wrap up this pandemic arc, develop Yanko, Mia, Daniel, Stella, and other characters, and find a more specific, unique plot for S3.",6
"Season 1 was decent. Season 2 is abysmal.","Season 2 is considerably worse than season 1. Always yelling. Always over the top wokeness. Character personalities have completely changed. Writing is stale. Unfortunately it just isn't worth watching. I'm 3 or 4 episodes into Season 2 and I'm calling it quits.",4
"Keep on watching - it gets better and better","The show starts out a bit slow, and I almost did not watch as I hate star vehicles where I can identify the actors. But with the strong recommendation from friends, I continued. And I am so glad that I did! I love shows that challenge the way I view the world. And seeing the ""Me Too Movement"" at every angle and at every layer was really good for me. I also want to show this to my son - to understand the subtlety and complexity of sexual harassment. Plus the ending was explosive - I just could not stop until I finished the season. Thank you Apple TV! This was a good beginning.",10
"Great show","I don't really understand the low ratings. This show since the first episode has kept me very interested! AND I don't understand the JA hating. Honestly she is superb in this role. I love the mix between serious with a touch of humor. I'm a Reese fan as much as any other person but I think Jennifer brings a lot to this role as much as Reese brings to hers. Give it a chance ignore the low reviews it's really a good show",10
"Nestor..","Does NOT wear eyeliner. Anyone who makes fun at this like he ""looks the same"" as his previous characters played, by always applying eyeliner is straight up rude and ignorant. This man has darker thicker lashes than most and I think it's beautiful. If you don't actually know personal facts about celebrities then don't talk about them. Stick to an honest review.",10
"Hard to digest, sometimes","I want to give this a 10 and a 1 at the same time. The acting is perfect. I really enjoy all the characters. But the banality of the so-called ""Morning Show"" has me wondering why in the world the Witherspoon character stands for it? The only interesting things she's done so far is the confession in episode 3, and the interview in episode 4 - the first at the beginning of her first week, and the second at the end of it. The show, that is the fictional show, offers nothing else of substance in between. I don't watch morning shows, or noon, or evening. Are they all like this?",8
"Definitely a perfect 10 for me","Super powerful ending and a sophisticated plot.
Amazing actors, each one of them exceeds expectations.
Can't wait for the next season!",10
"Remember to breathe!","What a roller coaster ride of drama/suspense/humor......emotions all over the place. I wish I could unsee the entire 10 episodes just so I could watch them again new. It was particularly amazing to see Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carrell and even Martin Short in characters we are unaccustomed to seeing. I mentioned these three, but as another review said, no matter the length of time an actor was in a scene, long or short, all performances were powerful. As for the final episode, don't forget to breathe!",10
"Season 2 mess - Unbearable Reese","I really loved the first Season and gave a very high rating but 2 is a mess, waited for the finale to write this. The finale was a mess, Jeniffer Aniston monologue was meandering and pointless surprisingly in a show with some great dialogues. Billy Crudup was the only reason for me to hang in there till the end. If they gave Razzies for web series, I would nominate Reese Witherspoon for the worst over the board acting, just hated every time she came on the screen. The biggest disappointment was their attempt to make us sympathise with the Black guy who wants to host the show as a racial issue, sorry he really seemed like a guy with the wrong attitude. If you don't get promoted, you don't badmouth your boss and embarrass your company in public , a badly written character. I still don't understand why were Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Karen Pittman not nominated for Emmy instead of Aniston and Witherspoon, thats where racism is apparent. Karen Pittman again shines with what little they give her, its a shame she is not being recognised for her performance.",6
"Wowwwww","Ok. I knew this show would be good. But this good??! Holy crap. Great actors & You can just feel the characters emotions in every scene! I give it a 10/10. So glad I watched this. They all killed it! Make sure to Give this a chance! It is worth every minute. Even the intro is cool In a screensaver sort of way.",10
"Season 1 - 9 ; Season 2 - 3 ; Average 6","Season 1 was great. A compelling overarching topic story line guided the season from a brilliant opening to a satisfying conclusion. Excellent.Season 2 was a mess. It lacked any main theme or story line. Many of the themes around Mitch and around Alex were without any interest. A few interesting snippets about the ""woke"" agenda. Mainly I just wasn't interested. It was as if they thought we were all Alex fans and would enjoy just watching here wallowing in self pity. As I watched I had hoped the CoVid storyline might have developed into an interesting theme but whilst it featured in the conclusion it really wasn't in any way interesting.I won't be watching Season 3.",6
"What the hell am I watching","Season 1 of this show was amazing. I gave it a 9 of 10. Season 2 is unwatchable. What the heck happened. Instead of hiring writers they must of stolen Days of our Lives scripts from the 80s. Even the Foo Fighters can't save this mess!",5
"Such a great show","One of the strongest first seasons in a while. Timely, funny, deep, provocative, and most of all a stellar ensemble cast. Can't wait for season two. My only criticism, I got a little tired of ""Alex's"" deep breathing...enough!",9
"Some of the BEST work from Jennifer and Reese","Such a highly tense show, some of the best work I've seen from Jennifer and Reese. I love the dynamic the drama and the story line of news anchors going head to head on popular, relevant topics of our time. Incredibly moving and important show. Will have u on the edge of ur seat.A must watch you will not be dissapointed.",10
"👏brilliant","Amazing acting and story lines. Love it from the opening line to the last moment of the last episode. Keep this show going pleaseeee",10
"Fabulous","It's about the craziness inside the studio! Billy Crudup and cast are amazing",10
"This is a BEYOND excellent series...","Main reason? Storytelling. Secondary? Each and every character seemingly playing against type, though we have seen Aniston playing similar(ish) characters, but never once this deeply, or this humanly. She kills it. Reese? Her character hasn't surprised me yet, but she owns it, 100% - Billy Crudup? Okay, he is really difficult for me. I have disliked him for forever, no real idea why honestly, but just a general distaste. Because of this, it's hard to watch him in whatever he's acting in. Having NO trouble with him in this series. He plays his character with depth, and subtlety, making us assume one thing about him, 100%, then throwing us in a different direction, and again, subtly... He's oddly not bothering me in this. Mark Duplass? Awesome as he always is... Steve Carell? Seen him in ONE other role played as a bad guy, and he was an ass and a half in that one. A movie, otherwise charming as the dickens, titled ""The Way, Way Back"" (awesomely cast! Starring these folks and more: Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Allison Janney, Sam Rockwell, Maya Rudolph, Liam James, Rob Corddry, Amanda Peet, etc.) - Having loved Steve Carell for years and years, that movie was the first I ever saw of him as a 100% ass. He owned the part, but good God, you just could NOT like him, period. In any case, he's beyond bad in this series, and it kind of sneaks up on you, truly. If you don't find yourself sitting there with your jaw hanging at some point, saying ""wth just happened, who IS this guy?"" *shudder*, well, then I give it to you, honestly... The series builds nicely, there are surprises you don't see coming, and the characters are all excellent actors at the top of their games. VERY looking forward to there being a second season plus of this. Please Apple, don't break my heart like so many have before... In any case, the series starts on a slower vibe, and builds very nicely to the conclusion where all are essentially in the same mentally discombobulated place as the characters, sitting and saying ""OMG!"" to themselves, time and again... Enjoy! Especially enjoy the range of actors playing parts so very different from their usual, and playing them with skill...!",8
"Watch only season 1","Season 2 is another woke sh...t of hollywood, whole plot changed to rights of lesbians/ asians and black people
We got it hollywood, we got it
Enough with this please.",10
"So good!","I just finished season one and I need season two NOW. Addictive, captivating, great character development. Definitely one of the best series I've watched in a while!",8
"Two likeable stars keep a mediocre story afloat","This show depends totally on the stars likability. That is not a bad thing. Both Jennifer and Reese play roles tailor made to them so if you are tuning into see them give meaty performances you won't be disappointed. Steve Carrell overacts. The story could have been sharper wittier and more subtle. It's not that well written a story based somewhat loosely on Matt Lauer's departure from NBC. The supporting cast consist of familiar faces.",7
"Just Finished 10th Episode","To start, I'm the guy often rolling my eyes at liberal Hollywood stories using over-the-top feminist themes shoved onto us with the subtlety of a rectal rehydration treatment. At first I thought this show was going to be more of the same, but it was not.
The cast are mostly veteran actors and were all very good. Aniston always delivers, but often ends up with weak material. This was a great showcase for her talents.
Also standout-amazing was actress Gigi Mbatha-Raw.
The whole cast was very good... smug Crudup, manic Witherspoon, desperate Duplass... the whole cast seemed invested. They created compelling characters that had me quickly invested in their lives (which was good because the story starts at a pretty slow pace). In retrospect the slow start was good because it gave me time to know the characters before weaving the detailed storyline.
Speaking of story, the writing is excellent. Jay Carson and Kerry Ehrin made a great dramatic series with a deft approach sexual issues in the workplace. The story took time for each character to explain their POV and/or justify their action (or lack of it). Too many shows have one-dimensional good/bad characters, but with this show we know the motivation of each person as the story goes forward, and I could feel empathy for nearly all of them.
The look of the show is big-budget great. The sets and scenery are all top notch.
The finale was done right... satisfying wrap ups with great potential for Season 2!",8
"Could've been better","Somewhat entertaining - Interestingly to me, the performances of the star players were far overshadowed by those of Mark Duplass, Billy Crudup and Nestor Carbonell.",6
"Great show","One of the weirdest critic I saw was that the show is left wing propaganda. Well this is on the opposite a very balanced show, that gives a voice to the men perspective on MeToo and criticises it very harshly while the main hero is a moderate conservative. This is why the show is good - you get different perspective and ideas.",5
"BRILLIANT!","BRILLIANT act, BRILLIANT plot, BRILLIANT directing and BRILLIANT cast. I loved this show and the finale episode was one of the best finale episodes i have ever seen. MUST WATCH!!!",10
"Worth the view,...awesome stuff!","This has been a rollercoaster of emotions to watch, in the best possible way.Seeing what I see and read, happening in real life in uk/Ireland in TV morning media, it actually depicts all of that in a realistic manner.All of the main characters, eg: Reese, etc, have played their role very well.I am particularly impressed by Jennifer Aniston. She has showed how well she can show more depth of character.Meaning, she is more than rom-com/comedy. She is an amazing actress on so many levels.Also, a random, non important judgment, but my Lord!....Reese Witherspoon is so beautiful as a brunette!A very nice, binge worthy series. I'll say 5*Whoever is reading this, have a blessed day! 🙏",9
"Can't help comparing it to ""The Newsroom""","A brave look into the complex interreactions among co-workers and the social repercusions of their actions. Also nice that the series approach these issues without schooling the viewer with moral teachings. Billy Crudup is elevating his character to the next level! Great performance.But watching the series reminded me of how much I missed ""The Newsroom"". Nevertheless, I highly recommend this one too.",8
"Great fiction about American corporate toxicity","Excellently written, amazingly accurate about the worst sides of US corporate toxicity, great acting of a 5* casting. You can't wait to binge watching S1, although S2 seems a bit more behind its level.",9
"Worth binge watching","I had procrastinated watching the series even after two years of positive comments. I am not a fan of soap opera type shows but even from episode 1 it has something special. Maybe the characters, the storytelling but at some point it became impossible not wanting to go to the next episode and the next and the next.There are no big twists or turns, no unexpected revelations as we know everything that is happening behind the scenes. But you can't stop until you watch the last minute of the last episode.",9
"Apple TV came to play","Wow. Great show. Everyone brings their A game in this and Jen Aniston really steals the thunder.",10
"Series 2 Disappointing","Enjoyed this show, all of S1 and most of S2, but in the end series two swerved off into a series of monologues, stupid and unrealistic behaviour and, in my view, totally lost the plot. Pity as the acting is terrific and overall a worthwhile watch.",6
"Genuinely one of the finest pieces of televison I've seen in awhile","This show is incredibly ballsy. It tackles the corruption and hypocritical sanctimony exhibited in show business over the MeToo movement. It even dares to explore the nuances of the movement, daring to play devil's advocate for the other side of the coin.The characters are all incredibly well developed, with each and every one of them being deeply flawed individuals.This show is actually a masterpiece, and I do not say that lightly. I never thought a show about a Morning Show would turn out to be so incredibly well written.Thank you Apple TV for distributing this show; I highly doubt it would've made it on any television network.",10
"GREAT START, WENT SOUTH","Jennifer Aniston does a stellar performance and displayed the wide range of her craft. From the good girl comedian to serious character you love to hate, she was well casted.The series started with a fantastic, engaging and interesting story line. But it didn't take long for political agendas to be softly introduced which we persevered. Shortly after every fiber of its tapestry was interwoven with every controversial political agenda you can imagine. So much so, we lost interest in the show and respect for certain players to stoop to such lows and agree to play such roles. It started deserving of so much potential and evolved into such a let down, disappointment and even disgust.Perhaps it will come full circle. But if so, it's taking too long and we've endured enough. We are done.",6
"!st Season Great, 2nd Terrible","This is the average of two seasons - 8 stars for 1 and 2 stars for 2. The 1st season was really good. The storylines were crisp. Direction and acting were equally good. The 2nd season they appear to have run out of steam and phoned it in. Dull and unbelievable plot. None of the main characters were sympathetic. I wanted to slap and and yell, ""Snap out of it!"" The only character I liked and would have liked to have seen more of is Paola unsure of the spelling, the Italian documentarian). Stick a fork in this one, it's done.",5
"Reminiscent of The West Wing","It's quite a feat to be able to tackle #MeToo in the world of television without a story becoming onedimensional. The Morning Show is anything but that. It serves us a stellar cast of characters with very raw, human flaws, set in a fast-paced story with walking-shots and blunt cynicism that are reminiscent of The West Wing.The only negative for me was Bradley Cooper's accent. I'm not from the States so I can't judge if its actually on-spot. All I know is that it sounds like she's having a perpetual aneurysm.",10
"Spot on!","This is completely off topic but Billy Crudup is the perfect fit for playing the Joker! Just gonna leave this here...",10
"brilliant show,superb cast at the top of their game.","I d been putting off watching this show,not my cup of tea etc etc,but i m running out of top rated things to watch. I needn t have worried,the morning show is right up there with the best.at first sight the cast may seem to be top heavy with female actors and don t get me wrong,witherspoon and aniston do a great job but the plaudits must go to steve carell,billy crudup and mark duplass.carell and crudup are a joy to watch with the latter showing what a top,top actor he is. The show is laden with things that i hate,the #metoo movement and the over sensitivity of ethnic minorities ,but at least the show does send them up to a certain extent.do yourself a favour and binge watch this gem,you won t regret it.",8
"Season 1 is a visual masterpiece,","""The Morning Show"" Season 1 is a visual masterpiece, especially during its depiction of the California wildfires. The imagery is breathtaking and adds a visceral intensity to the storyline. The portrayal of the two lead characters is nothing short of remarkable, with their complexities and dynamics driving the narrative forward. The series offers a captivating glimpse into the inner workings of a network, shedding light on the unseen machinations of the industry. It's a meticulously crafted show, evident in its high production values and attention to detail. With its palpable tension and engrossing storytelling, ""The Morning Show"" proves to be a riveting watch that leaves a lasting impression.",10
"Captured upon arrival","Very well done. Episode 8 gave a fair warning about what was coming and I'm glad they did that. That scene...captured a similar experience I had at age 19-putting that in the show -it made me feel that I wasn't alone any longer.I know how Hannah felt and too many women are left feeling like they did something wrong",10
"brilliant show good storytelling . except","Reese Witherspoon being whiny almost in every film which I find very annoying.. looks like she cant act without yelling... and swearing.. stopped counting how many times she's used the f-word.. Aniston and Crudup at their best .",8
"A tale of two seasons","Season 1 of TMS is an entertaining glimpse into the ego-driven world of commercial live TV. Jennifer Anniston and Steve Carell are anchors of a morning show but from the start Carell's character is sacked for sexual abuse. Reese Witherspoon plays a feisty reporter who finds herself co-opted as Carell's replacement, and several storylines unfold over the 10 episodes, arranged around these three key characters.The acting is generally good although JA just always seems to be playing herself and some lines in the script must have been hard for her to say. RW is strangely not at her best and often seems slightly distracted. SC tries hard but is miscast as a misogynist. Billy Crudup as the director of News is the best and steals most scenes he is in, but he does get the best lines too. Nice to see Jack Davenport in a small supporting role, although he isn't given much to work with.Overall however it's an engaging if flawed show, and hence the 7/10 rating. The final episode of season 1 ends with a slightly unexpected bombshell twist, but does invite you to look forward to the next season.From the first episode in season 2 however, you wonder if they sacked all the writers and replaced them with D-graders. It's like watching a completely different show, and it stinks. I stayed with it till the end but only a few episodes have any redeeming features, so my rating for season 2 is 4/10. All the key characters seem to have become someone different yet with the same name - it just doesn't gel. There's a lot of anger and shouting suddenly, especially from the RW character, and even Billy Crudup's character has been stripped of some of the humanity that made him stand out in season 1 (although Crudup tries hard to hang in there). The storyline's are also less convincing or even appropriate. It's a good demonstration of how critically important the writing is for a successful show.I will not be watching season 3.",7
"Entertaining","I really liked ""The Morning Show""
Thought the acting was great
Loved the character development
I also really liked how they addressed current issues and the handling of them very realistically.As much as I wanted to I really couldn't hate the two lead characters. I'm guessing there won't be a third season which is disappointing.",8
"Meh","The acting feels pretty forced and the plot is predictable. Apple needs to measure itself against HBO; something like Succession is a pretty close comp. But so far this show isn't close to that level.",6
"Should've stopped after season 1!!","Season 1 was great. Season two is a mess & not worth the time.",3
"I really like this show","I really like this show, but to be fair, not all of it. Reese Witherspoon really carries the whole thing. In season 1, you can skip all scenes without Reese, and only watch the ones she's in, and you'll not miss any of the plot. Season 2 is overall worse than season 1. Jennifer Anistons character gets more interesting, but the story just seems lost, like there is no real point of the whole season and so much is left open. And season 3, until now, is pretty good actually. Billy Crudup shines this season, they focus more on the main characters, and the story line is really engaging, can't wait for more. Love it!",10
"Excellent","The show highlights the politics of a media organization. It emphasizes how powerful these news organizations are in stirring public opinion for the sake of good publicity. The cast do not disappoint in their performances in every episode. This is a show I look forward to every week!",9
"Awesome and binge worthy!","I never thought I would find a TV show that would get me hooked from beginning to end! Not a single dull moment or filler in this one. Stop reading reviews. Go and watch this!Can't wait for Seasons 2!",10
"Hell of a Good TV Show","So I finished watching the first Season. And I have to say the Morning Show is one of the greatest TV Shows I watched. You literally can smell the Money Apple put into that Show. I mean it payed off!Im watching forward for the second season.
Keep on Doing Apple you doing good in the Showbiz, can't complain!Keep winning Apple.",10
"Great Show!","Excellent show, it definitely exceeded my expectations! Great acting, great story and interesting characters that keep you hooked from the beginning till the end.",10
"Relevant story","I believe this story is quite relevant and actual today on this wave of confessions about harassments at work and story about Harvey Weinstein. And however it helps us to dive into the life of a prototype of an American morning show and the mechanisms how it works.",9
"after the first three episode it certainly doesnt feel like a mistake to watch what comes next","Dont get me wrong. the series is not perfect and some parts could do better. e.g. the script has some weaknesses and sometimes that seem to reflect on the performance of the actresses and actors. There are some big names in the project and they deserve a little better. But it is far from really bad and the show and the story seem to grow legs as it progresses.some people complain about a tv-series about a news show being political. Well ... if you really want a story with substance how can it not be? I disagree that it has a left bias. If any it goes at a very controversial topic with a realistic view trying to show what it implies with all the layers and perspectives. Ok if we are very sensitive it might feel like another ""more power to the women"" where all the men are bad or weak of both. But is it really? Lets face it: the industry is still dominated by men. All the harassment cases are the result of men being in power and sometimes abusing it, sometimes just using it and certainly sometimes just getting lucky. Doesnt change that they are there. So ... how can we take anything serious when it doesnt deal with that? Especially in a field where it is a major issue?but we must not forget that is just the backdrop for a story that shows us different characters and how they try to deal with the world they are in. And we could easily see the story also being about someone who doesnt want to compromise and shoots herself in the foot more than once because of that. Now she is put in the sugar coat industry where terrible things are smiled away so people can have a good day. That is going to be interesting. Also what do morals mean once you are put into a situation where you really have to weigh them against something that also matters to you? On the other hand how about facades once they come down? Btw. when i said the writing needs improvement there are certainly points where it already shines. Moments when these characters confront each other and find some truth. If we get more of that it will be very interesting and very entertaining.so all in all i'll give it at the moment 7 stars.
5 meaning decent but not extraordinary also not bad
6 for production value and directing etc.
7 for having an engaging story line and creating interest for the characters
8,9,10 will be reserved for real mindblowing stuff. something that makes it a must to see what comes next not just not a bad idea.",7
"Good start, but still flawed","Having watched the first 3 eps i find myself enjoying the show but unable to fully commit and crown it the new best thing on tv. I cant help but feel its heavily influenced by or atleast is trying to b HBO's The Newsroom which i did deem to be one of the best things on tv. I like that they are trying to be relevant and addressing issues that are prevalent in todays society but the political and social bias at times feels abit in your face. The pacing is fine as is the writing but the true winner is the performances from a great cast. While the show lacks some originality and at times feels forced its a solid start and good addition to Apple's streaming site. Will it be enough to compete with the likes of Netflix and Disney.... maybe not but certainly gives them a base to work from. Im curious how they will deal with Mitch going forward and the allegations put forth about him. Enjoyable and compelling but with small flaws that if not controlled could tarnish alot of peoples views of the show.",8
"Started Well","The first season was good but by the end of season two it took a turn for the contrived and we lost interest. And as much as I like Ms. Anniston, I found her attempting to cry showed no true emotion or for that fact a tear! We won't be continuing to watch. We felt the best ending would be for all of them to have in been in the car with Mitch.",7
"A tale of two seasons","I enjoyed season one and was intrigued by where it was going to go in season two.Unfortunately it went downhill drastically and I gave up part way through season two. Some characters were suddenly nothing like how they behaved in season one with no explanation, and some of the storylines were painful. I had no care for the characters in season two and with each episode I felt like I was just trying to survive it by keeping watching. Definitely should have stopped at the end of season one.It's very ironic season one focuses on telling the 'truth' and not agendas - then season two shows up and tries to preach a load of agendas at you.Season one: 7.5/10
Season two: 2/10.",4
"Hot","Great show with a star studded cast brilliant music and story line",10
"Excellent In All Areas","I work in news, and I want to work on The Morning Show. Lol. If only news was this dramatic.I highly enjoyed this show from beginning to end. Obviously, tackling the #metoo movement is a big task, but I feel they did a really good job trying to take on every angle and not getting bogged down in radical politics. They do a great job flushing out the humanity of the characters, with both positive and negative qualities. I loved the title sequence & song, which few shows invest much thought or artistry inti anymore, along with all the soundtrack throughout the season.Jennifer Anniston is amazing in her performance. I highly enjoyed Billy Crudup's character. His writing and delivery were all phenomenal. Reese Witherspoon & Steve Carrell were also excellent but overshadowed just a bit by the other two for me.I will say, however, Steve's performance in the Las Vegas episode was beyond extraordinary in its portrayal of a predator, the charisma and betrayal were just creepy and disturbing on an epic level.",9
"Can I just say wow?","Two words: Jennifer Aniston
My goodness she is such a powerhouse here! If she does NOT take the Golden Globe for this outstanding performance, I will lose all faith in the award system. I have never seen her better than this. I'm a long time fan of hers, and now she has cemented her spot as an A lister. Phenomenal show, too, overall. Reese Witherspoon is also fabulous in this, as well as Steve Carrel. But Jennifer completely knocks it out of the park",10
"Intense. Great Picture. Love it.","As much as I'm excited for the launch of Apple TV+, it was a bit struggling for me to pick which show to start off first. I'm glad I picked The Morning Show because two of my most favorites Actresses are there. As I'm watching it, I began to feel like I'm watching a movie, not a TV show. The picture looks great on my 75 inch 4K QLED TV. I love the whole cast. The show is depressing at the beginning and it starts to be intense after 30 minutes but I love it. Can't wait for more episodes to come.",10
"Bring back the memory of my job...","Many may not agree with me, but I love the show.
Good and amazing acting from the cast, kudos to everyone.
Good productions, good writing, very truthful depiction of our industry and the newsroom's battle, very detailed and serious production, and design.
The script is good from the two episodes I have seen so far, and I am hooked to follow up on the remaining of the show.
Good pace, good tempo!
Above all, the show brought me back to the days of me working in morning news - waking up in the middle of the night, working 24/7, the clash of topics for presentation, and the nastiness of people in front and behind the cameras, the management style of the networks, etc, etc. All these are well revealed in the episodes.
One point though, it is always a struggle for newsmakers now as what they need to put on the air. Is it a serious topic? or average, normal, dumb topic that the public is more keen on? And with the MeToo, racial discrimination, people sending clips through their phones, etc. Editorial judgment becomes even tougher. Then, the senior production staff is always pressure from management because of rating, demands of show presenters, it is indeed a nightmare working in tv news. But we all still love it because this industry is just so much fun.
TMS exposes all these points rightly and it is fantastic to see a show that brings me back to the old days. And I do hope it will make whoever sees this show to re-think what we want from our news shows and media now. At the end of the days, news and morning shows should probably just be news and fair. Entertainment shows for entertaining.
Finally, the life depicted in the drama regarding behind the scenes, complex relationships (including sexual ones) amongst the staff, the talkers and the doers, are all very realistic and I saluted the script writers and directors in carrying out these scenes wonderfully.
A good show with many issues covered, let's be fair in criticizing it.",9
"Billy Crudup is brilliant","Amazing star studded cast, but the performance of Billy Crudup is remarkable. If it wasn't for him this show might have bored me. But this well written character is embodied by Billy and its phenominal! From start to finish this is a cut throat look at what happens when someone very popular and seemingly loved by America and co workers is fired because of the me too movement. Again such a well written show. The twists and turns, the many characters the different story lines. Wow . Leaves me hanging with an after taste. Uncomfortable. But that's what I love about this show. This real, this is showing truth from different views. A reminder that this is still happening. maybe not at a tv show but a small local company. its; all about power and money. It can happen everywhere",10
"Just found this on Apple TV+","Season one was great. I just started season 2 and I'm lost in the woods. No idea what the heck is going on. But, the reviews are mostly bad related to season two. Maybe it will unfold - I'm not expecting much.",7
"ONE OF THE BEST TV SHOW EVER","Idk what to say, but.... thank u for bring this issue, this show speaks more than u could ever imagine. I love how real and dramatic it is.
and the cast... wow, just brilliant!!!! cant wait for season 2, gonna watch it for sure!!!",10
"Great and Not","Season One: great and full of intrigue.Season Two: Woke hot garbage. Characters are flat, story line is flat, Jennifer Anniston looks puffy. Just awful.",7
"Season 2 ruins the show","The first season was engaging. Steve and Jennifer obviously carried the show. But the second season is so disgustingly heavy handed it's unwatchable. Manufactured drama and forced dialogue is practically laughable. Horrible writing. Every male character is a sniveling, repugnant creep. Basically just more Hollywood propaganda disguised as entertainment.",2
"GOT turned into American morning TV","Award-winning performances and a compelling storyline earns a solid 8-star rating. Yet, there were moments when the series seemed to drown in its own sea of drama, with crises piling up faster than morning coffee orders at a local Starbucks.It seemed as though the show aimed for a ""Game of Thrones in modern American morning TV"" vibe, attempting to weave a complex tapestry of simultaneous arcs and storylines within a single season. Unfortunately, this ambitious approach didn't always hit the mark, leaving some narrative threads feeling overstretched. This is particularly noticeable in seasons 2 and 3, where constant crises - from covid to cyberattacks, traffic accidents, romantic relationships, corporate takeovers, and nasty leaks to the press about someone's personal life - overwhelm the narrative.The acting, undoubtedly, is the show's strong suit. The stellar cast, led by Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, delivers powerhouse performances, making each episode a captivating watch. Visually, the show spared no expense in delivering stunning cinematography and production values that matched the grandeur of its thematic ambitions.Billy Crudup's character Cory, embodying modern capitalism, is by far, along with Aniston's feminist-hero Alex, the most interesting and complex character in the show. Season 3, in particular, reveals a more vulnerable human side to both characters, expanding their roles as rich media people with competitive ambitions.The series as a whole is enjoyable but not without its flaws. Season 1 is unique and interesting, while Season 2 felt somewhat perplexed, with the absence of a clear script being evident. Delving deeper into the aftermath of the #MeToo movement and the intricate relationship between Mitch and Alex would have provided a more satisfying narrative arc. Season 3 represents a significant improvement from Season 2 but doesn't quite reach the level of Season 1. The amount of drama in Season 3 and the relationship dynamics, particularly the subplot involving Reese's character and her brother, felt at times like an unnecessary detour.Hopefully future seasons will strike a more harmonious balance between drama and cohesion.",8
"One word WOWZERS!!!","This show is just brilliant. Was a bit skeptic at the start but Morning Wars will have you hooked. The stellar cast is just a start and the storyline is just brilliant. Give it ago and you will not be disappointed.",10
"Season 2","Thank god Reese doesn't have to wear those horrible wigs this season.",8
"Season 2 disappointed me","Season one has a great story line and everything was amazing but season 2 OMG didn't make it and everything so complicated and storyline so vague and fast and disappointed me.",10
"A fantastic series 10/10","This was typically a series that I absolutely could not put down I watched all three seasons in one so then people can write how much s*** they want. I loved the characters and it was as messy as it gets and just absolutely fantastically crazy. I .can't help but wonder if this is how it goes on TV channels in the US, it wouldn't surprise me one bit actually. I can actually imagine that it's just this crazy considering that a country can vote for Trump as president Well then maybe the TV station was just as damn crazy. I also very well believe that it is exactly the case that it is those with money who control everything in the United States, from the White House to television channels and newspapers. And it's good that you address the enormous racism and injustice that still exists in America between the sexes. In fact, it seems that most of the people who write here seem to be too short-sighted to even understand the Agenda and the text, the meaning behind the whole series. That might explain why people were stupid enough to storm their own Capitol.All the actors are good, but...
Billy Crudup as Cory is absolutely BEST <3.",10
"Drama, but on the next level","I didn't have any expectations for this series because I generally don't watch drama. But this just showed me one of the best dramas I have seen.I'm fascinated how well this story is made on every level, specially the actors and the studio environment. Even if many of the sceneries is made in the same studio room they made it alive and interesting. I haven't been in a real TV studio but I bet it must be almost the same.This story shows how fast news can destroy careers, and that's also the main plot for the morning show in my opinion.I can't say that Jennifer Aniston is the star in ""The Morning show"", even if I want to do that. She was good but not the best one. All actors made this story great and I hope we'll see the same actors in season 2.",9
"Takes Itself Too Seriously","While the technical aspects of this show are great (cinematography, lighting, editing, etc) I think it kind of beats its themes into the ground a bit. A whole season about MeToo, a season and a half about dealing with COVID... while I get the appeal to stay current I think it's a bit much. Take, for example, a show like The Newsroom that also covers hot-button topics. Almost every episode is about something different because the news is always changing (hello 24 hours news cycle).I mean, at the end of the day, this is about a morning show. People tune in to Morning Shows for an easy watch - celebrities cooking recipes and the anchors petting dogs for a local shelter - not hard-hitting anchors breaking stories.The shows is well-made, but I found it difficult to care about characters when their entire identities are their work. Don't create bland, emotionless characters and then try and get me to care about their self-induced struggles. The show seems to be built on conflict, much of it being created internally. They also seem to run out of plot points a lot for a show that is supposed to be focused on somewhat current events.I know this review seems pretty negative, but I am pretty harsh having worked in the industry and being a big fan of this subject matter. Overall, the show is well made. It just could be a lot better. Many people will enjoy this show and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Give it a watch for yourself and see what you think. I just expected more from the excellent cast and the amount of money they sunk into this thing.",7
"Omg I was hooked","So many twists and all the way through it keeps you thinking! Jennifer Anniston is amazing in this and such a different character from her usual but portrays it amazingly.
This is chilling at times and has some really good twists and keeps you guessing until the end! You don't get what you want but it works... I can't wait for season two!!!",10
"Too much profanity","Good content but wished there wasn't as many F bombs.",6
"Got very boring in season 2","Started out well in season 1 and superb ending. But season 2 was just loud dialogues, too many long speeches that bordered on lecturing. Over the top acting by everyone, you know they are desperate to be nominated. Very boring and annoying, nothing new just blah blah blah....",1
"I'm hooked!","Fantastic acting here by Jennifer Aniston- she is getting better and better with age! I'm at the end of episode 2, and what an ending! Can't wait to watch the third...",9
"It's about time!","Jennifer Aniston has found her voice again. Not in a sit calm but a actual grown up show. Bravo! Her comedy movies never showed her acting abilities. I have been waiting for her to do a serious drama since Friends ended...
The cast around her are more than just supporting rolls. Reese Witherspoon is a gem who plays off Jennifer perfectly. I haven't enjoy this kind of Television since The Good Wife.
Can't wait for the next episodes!!!",10
"The dark side of an TV Show","Yeah jus saw the 3 episodes... and the cast are amazing, bravo. Love Reese and Jennifer 2 power women.",10
"What the...I just watched!!!!","The morning show is the hottest tv series in America!!! I was so hooked watching the episodes. Apple TV + just created the best series. I could not leave to go use the bathroom or do anything else, not kidding! I just love it!!!
Aniston, Witherspoon, Carell, and Crudup are phenomenal. Great story and so relevant to our times and be able to see what is or could happens behind the scenes on tv-show business. Give it a try! Is fantastically entertaining. Can't wait for the next episode!",10
"A Lot of Truth About Today's Elitist Culture","I just finished the second season of this show and I think I have a different opinion of it than most of you who wrote in here have. My takeaway is that this show reflects the culture we currently are living in. From the beginning, to me, it was very evident that egos run large in those in people places of power, whether it be on a morning TV show, an average corporation, the elitists who run our government today, pretty much anyone who has enough money to buy themselves out of trouble. I know this was just a TV show, but the story was brilliantly written, showing the cracks in a society which values power, money, getting ahead. Skin color, nationality, sexual preference, or whatever issue of the day, over average everyday people who toil away just trying to make ends meet and/or raise their kids the best they can on a salary those who are making policy at networks, the top of the government, the WOKE society, anyone who thinks they are bigger and better then everyone else, could never live on!I loved this show because I don't think they meant to ""out"" what most of middle America sees in the new cancel culture currently wreaking havoc across the nation. I could actually review the show itself, because that is important, too! I disagree with many of you who took issue with season 2 because it was too woke, to scattered, too immersed in issues most of us do not understand nor care about. What was portrayed, and portrayed very well, I will add, by the actors and the crew involved, the writers, the producers, all, in my opinion, excellent, was that the cancel culture is and has gone too far. I'm not sure that was what the people involved in this project meant to leave me with, but I can tell you, I will NEVER watch a news show or morning program again without thinking about what happened on this show.If you go back and read my almost 100 reviews in here, you will see that I have been railing against Hollywood and their ignorance about middle America all along. This show highlighted my opinion! They threw all the blame on one character for being a sexual predator, and a racist because of innuendos and one woman's confession. This man, Mitch Kessler, excellently played by Steve Carrell, was ostracized and his 20 year career with 8 Emmy awards, was trashed until he ended up a pariah in Italy. And after taking all the blame on himself and being obviously tortured by his own decisions, drove himself off a cliff and died. Not one other person took any of the blame themselves, mind you! And THAT was the brilliance that many people who reviewed this show did not get.I loved this show because, for once, Hollywood outed itself! Some will say it's just a show. I know with all my heart, it was much more than a show. I truly have come to believe what is portrayed in this show is what is happening all over corporate America, Hollywood actors, and possibly the world. Those with the most money and a cause to blow it all over, win!! The rest of us, just trying to live our lives, make a decent living, fighting with family, loving our family, have became slaves to this new culture and the consequences often left behind or covered up like a cat in a litter box.Kudos to Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon for their portrayals as lead anchors on a popular morning show. The breadth of their talent was definitely apparent in this piece. In fact, the entire cast was excellent. I hated some of them, OK I hated most of them. I think the only one I did not despise was Mia, played by Karen Pittman and the Italian documentarian. So much talent, so well used. Everything was great, including the cinematography, the seamlessness of the story (good show runners!), and the brilliance of the writers. I don't know that they intended me to see through all the cracks in our, spoiled, specialty, WOKE, society, but as I said, I will never watch live TV again on any station, anywhere, with the same eyes!I highly recommend you watch it yourself. I will admit that the liberal progressive slant disturbed me at times, but they really did not make that the center of the show or I would not have binge watched it all the way to the end of the second season. There is enough content in this show to make every sides' opinions feel insulted at times. THAT is when you know you've made a good show! When every side doesn't get everything it wants! I will revisit my 10 rating after viewing season 3 if it does not live up to the first two seasons.",10
"Made my day","Best new show since The Boys, judging by the first 3 episodes.I've seen reviews rating it 1/10 because they don't watch politics in their show. Yeah f* you, don't watch it then? There's a million other shows without it.
I've also seen reviews talking about the swearing and how it's a sign of ""bad writing"". And to those: Have ypu ever listened to yourself talk? The swearing makes the writing authentic. We're seeing it more and more, most recent example would be ""Impulse"" on YouTune, that studios allow swearing in their shows, which in my opinion is the best that could've happened to tv. I mean, we all f*ing swear, don't we?Ok, that aside, let's talk about the show.From the start on it is clear that this is a show HEAVILY and daringly criticizing and/or atleast critically inspecting modern politics and especially the #metoo movement. I've personally talked about this with so many people before. Cause noone f*ing cares any more and careers get destroyed by it. Don't get me wrong, I am all for speaking up if there is something to actually speak up for and I am all for punishing those who are ACTUALLY guilty, but this show finally dares to deal with the dark side of this topic on a grander scale. +1 for that.Many shows today are about women's empowerment, and there is nothing wrong about that, and it's in this show too, BUT we also get to see the other side. It's not only that. +1 for that.The story so far is VERY entertaining and also really touching at times, not gonna go much more into detail on that. +1Now to more technical aspects: The show does a really great job with their camera-work. All those one-shots in the studios walkways are REALLY cool and give you the feeling of haste that must go on there and it really gets you into the scene, love that.Last but not least, I'll have to point out how truly great Jennifer Anistons, Reese Witherspoons and Billy Crudups performances are in this. Wow!Apple, you really outdid yourselves on this one. Great start for the service!",9
"Season 1 was a 10/10 Season 2 a 5/10","A shame really as the first season had me hooked, the pacing, the characters, the great performances from the cast apart from the guy who played the EP, he always looked half asleep and for an EP IRL that just wouldn't work or inspire. Reese Witherspoon wasn't the best casting choice for the second fiddle. But all the tension kept the show alive to the last riveting denouement in Episode 10.Season 2 was obviously the stretching the elastic as far as it would go series. It should have been left in the can. Far too many filler scenes and meaningless dialogue in a vomit of confessions in Italy of all places. Melodramatic and eyebrow lifting. And an addict brother and other subplots thrown in for good measure which loosened the whole story and had me yawning. Even through Jennifer doing her very best on her confessional atonement vomit at the end.Mixed review in the header.",7
"Do not trust the bad ratings","The show is amazing. The bad ratings make no sense to me. Yes it is politically charged but who cares. It is current and amazing. Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston are awesome and all the dynamics are intriguing. Not 10 out of 10 but every episode has gotten better and better.",9
"WTF","After a relatively good season 1, during which both leading actresses pleasantly surprised me in their roles, I continued to binge season 2.I'm giving up though, 2 episodes too early to finish this season too. This second season has gone so off track from the original storyline and actual TMS studio set, and has turned into one episode after the other being about rants and explosive characters, way too much drama to take in all at once.Jennifer's acting has regressed to what I know of her, and proved to me she isn't capable of anything really serious. Mmm.. it's all a bit of shame, as they did sort of start off well..My rating in detail would be: 8/10 for season 1, 4/10 for season 2.",6
"UBA goes IDK","A strong first season turns into a mushy mess with Aniston limping around with a on again, off again back problem and Witherspoon going gay. The Italy episode is a hot mess and if you're a fan of this series and haven't seen this one, take my advice and don't watch. If I ran UBA I'd bring back CAPT Kangaroo and boot all these senseless neurotic liars out on the street. Pathetic.",3
"Absolutely love this show!","While I admit that I have never been a Jennifer Aniston fan, the casting dept was spot on choosing her for this role! Having once worked behind the scenes in live television and spending many years in a studio, this show truly exemplifies the workings of a television show both on air and off! Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carey are also perfect in their roles! I subscribed to Apple TV just to watch this show, and I'm holding out on watching episode 4 because then I'll have to wait a whole week for the next episode! Yep. It's THAT good!",10
"Thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining...","I don't have any streaming subscriptions and never wanted one....until I made the ""mistake"" of watching the first 2 free episodes of TMS on TV+.
So now I have one, simply to be able to carry on watching this compelling TV drama. In short, I love it. Some really classy acting, a great storyline with real relevance to today's world, and good fun at the same time !
I also happen to have worked in breakfast TV in the UK and TMS accurately replicates the seeming chaos that goes into what appears to be the polished end-product called a breakfast tv show!!!
Well done to all involved, cast and crew.",10
"Not my usual fare but WOW!","The acting in this is just superb! LOVE the story and it hooked me from the first episode.Trying not to binge my way through in lockdown. It's become a daily treat!Well Done Jennifer and Ryhs!",10
"What a Gem!","What an incredible surprise this show is! ALL of the characters are incredible! Each and everyone! But Mark Duplass is stellar! I recognized him from some other show, where he played an awful character-but played it well. I hope they keep him in the cast! I don't ever want to see this show end! WOW! How Relevant can a show get! This is stellar! This is REAL LIFE as we do NOT really see from the outside!",10
"Just wow!","Jennifer Aniston just won an Oscar. Episode 10 is the best one. The one who was in charged for picking all the actor deserve an Oscar too haha. All of them were amazing!",10
"Aniston's best work","Watched the first 3 eps last night. It's brilliant ! Timely and emotive, but funny and well paced as well.
Reece Witherspoon is always amazing in everything thing she does and she seems to pick really great material and this is no exception. But Jennifer Aniston is the real reason to watch the show. Her movie choices often haven't shown her acting chops in the best light but this is totally her best role . It's really meaty, and well written and she is playing a real character with flaws who I'm excited to see develop. Tv is definitely the place to come these days for great acting and Story telling. Ignore the ""critics "" this is damn good television !",9
"Waste of time","The first season was good, shame the same can't be said about the 2nd season. We found ourselves just watching it just to finish it. What a waste of time.",6
"Well maybe one of the dogs had an abortion","I liked this show a lot, but by the LA fires episode with the line ""Well maybe one of the dogs had an abortion"", true gold. Amazing writing, outstanding acting, sharp cinematography. Deserves all the accolades. Outstanding show. 9/10",9
"Well done negativity","Though well written and performed, the problem is watching each episode is like getting your daily dose of negativity. Everyone has baggage, quarrels and shouting in nearly every scene. It gets tiresome.Great story telling though.",7
"Only season 1","The first series is great. The second is a waste of time.",3
"Brilliant","Nothing more to be said. Loved it from start to finish. The acting, the story line, the lot 👍👍",10
"Riveting. Great script, great direction, great cast!","So well written and well acted. Every character was credible. So good to watch an original show as opposed to the 1 dimensional mind-numbing junk that Netflix keeps dishing up lately.
Keep making high quality programs like this one Apple, and you will surely win the streaming wars.",8
"Absolutely Brilliant","I'm a conservative and a Trump voting Republican. I started watching The Morning Show because I was interested in the Matt Lauer story. To be honest I was a little concerned that their take on his story would come from a ""Me Too"", liberal bias and that I'd probably not make through the first couple of episodes. I was wrong. This show is absolutely brilliant! It does an excellent job of showing both sides of the story; what it feels like to have our current Cancel Culture judge and destroy lives. It reveals the consequences of bad choices, but it also has empathy for people who have made mistakes, and have a desire for redemption. Season 2 is even better than the first. The writing and acting is brilliant. Im looking forward to where they will take this in Season 3. This is the currently the best show on television! Conservative or Liberal, there's something for everyone.",10
"Great characters and excellent acting, makes appletv+ worth it","I will admit that this was the first series on appletv+ that I watched to completion, the leads casted were too difficult to pass and I was not wrong! Great performances by everybody including the supporting cast. Whenever somebody feels #metoo is having difficulties staying afloat in a field which has many trending hashtags in 2020, this series will just reassure to make it still relevant.This is a must watch, not because it depicts gender bias but rather takes the viewers through the fine silver thread of what is moral and what is not.
Jennifer Aniston, as one reviewer mentioned that her talent was wasted in Friends for so many years - I couldn't agree more! I don't say FRIENDS was bad, its still a series I binge watch once in a while but I sincerely think she has lots of scope to try various genres and excel in them.
Read the plot from the summary, if you are interested in the setting I can assure you its a real fun watch!",8
"Really, really good","This show absolutely blew away my expectations. Id rank this right up with some of the highest quality television Ive ever seen.Stunning performances from all cast. Great to see Pete from The League in the mix with a much more serious role. Reese stunning work as ever. Steve Carrell absolutely nails it. Jen I thought struggled on some of the 'angry' scenes but was overall very good.The show almost feels like a bit of a Mystery genre given youre strung slong with not wuite knowing whats actually happened and wondering who's in the right.The handling of the #metoo issue is nuanced, and balanced. It generated a lot of heated back and forth in our household. The issue is not a black and white issue, and there are subtleties to the individual circumstances. Yes, there is a bit if a message in there eventually. But its balanced, and delicate. There is no overt agenda being jammed down your throat. Frankly any reviewer saying otherwise is a bit of a loon.The characters and situations are REAL. Like VERY real. This is what really hits home about the events and what gives the show a strong emotional resonance.To summarise, absolute must watch. Very few negatives. Highly bingeable. Very much looking forward to a second season.",10
"Amazing show","I absolutely enjoyed every episode of this show, acting ans storytelling was superb, dealt exceptionally well with a very real and current topic, a must watch",10
"Hit and miss","I really enjoyed the first season but the second season is hit and miss with maybe two decent episodes. The others were lacking and characters simply whiney throughout. The last episode killed it for me completely. It wrapped nothing up and became a covid borefest, of which, I am sure we are all sick to death of hearing about after the last couple of years. I'm not really sure what the writers were thinking. I really expected much more! I doubt I will be watching the third season which is shame really because there was so much potential which I am sure will be used to drag out yet another season.",7
"Surprised me how good it is","I started watching with low expectations and started liking it. Then I thought I knew where it was going and it went a direction I didn't expect, but this made the show even better.",10
"What's left on the cutting room floor?","Firstly just need to say I really enjoy the show. The main characters are well rounded and seem to fit well. Several strong characters all squeezed in. But my small complaint is that there seem to be huge gaps in story lines at point. It's as if (and most likely is) they have removed sections of film in the edit to fit within episode time limits. This is most noticeable in series three. On several occasions I've had to rewatch a previous episode because I assume I must have missed an important plot point due to leaving the room, being distracted or falling asleep. Only to find I didn't miss a second and I'm just expected to catch up. Fortunately it's a very enjoyable show.",6
"Barf. Egos gone mad.","Initially, a good show turned into garbage. Unbelievable these peoples egos and God syndrome. It's kind of disgusting how they plug in all the jargon in popular words that are happening. These people think they're indispensable. It's really turned in the garbage. Probably the most gross show I've seen. I can't believe that these people think they're so important. Funny how the money goes to their head. Egos gone mad. It's really just a bunch of crap. Disappointing show. Like they think they're so important. America can't go on without them. They're really just trashy people. Money can't buy class.",1
"Must see","This series is enthralling with an all star cast and supporting actors who steal the scenes they are in. Every minute is full of action and dialogue. Both lead actresses break the stereotypical roles you expect from them as well as Steve Carell. I watched all 10 episodes in one weekend. I hadn't heard about this show until I boarded a cross country try flight on American. Once I saw the first episode, I downloaded and subscribed to Apple TV. The only thing missing here is better marketing so that everyone sees it and we are guaranteed many more seasons. The storyline opportunities are endless and I need many more scenes with Billy Crudup. So we'll acted, so we'll directed, and so well written; this series is a top favorite for me personally. Thank you and bravo!",8
"This is the show I've been waiting for!","First let's talk about billy crudup, he is phenomenal, i love everything about his character its what makes the show shine, and i cannot believe how addictive this show is! It keeps you wanting more and shock you when you let your guard down! Heavily recommended.P.s. it's not an anti-man show like some claim, its telling the stories that doesn't get to be told because it's not straight forward enough, the between the lines stories that women get too embarrassed to talk about them. It's brave to go after something not many of us understand.",10
"Amazing","Huge fan. I mean HUGE fan. Great script great acting great plot just great. Jennifer Aniston is a total goddess and so is Reese Witherspoon. Can't wait for season 2",10
"A great riveting show","Soft spoilers.
Loved how show despite being a drama keeps you hooked as to whats gonna happen like you are reading a page turner novel. Everybody has shades of white and grey and tries to save their own asses when cornered which could be relatable to how people are in real life. And still they have a guilt in their hearts that they are doing something wrong or turning in on their own friends. While at it, it is suspenseful to know which side the show will turn which is revealed in the last episode. Although you would anticipate some other way the show would end given the title of the episode it just ends on an entirely different note.Acting wise during the first few episodes you would see all the three main characters screaming in one scene or the other. But gradually they settle in well in their roles. Aniston though in a serious role still reminds you of Rachel. Witherspoon gives a really nuanced performance trying to be righteous all the time, a truth teller. Steve Carrell also gives a great performance. Billy Crudup doesnt let you guess which side is he on. During the initial episodes you would think he is manipulative but realize his intentions later on. Mark Duplas is great too and so is Hannah.",9
"Top notch drama series","What a great TV show! Impeccable production, music, acting, cinematography and writing! Great, great show. A relief to find this to watch among so many of the obvious things around. Go check it out!",9
"Brilliant","Brilliant script. Brilliant characters. Brilliant production. Brilliant story. Brilliant complexity. Brilliant depth. Brilliant acting. Brilliant direction. Brilliant drama.",10
"Couldn't stomach this","Steve Carell, what were you thinking?I love a newsroom drama and there have been some great ones. This was probably a good idea for a drama: #MeToo meets TV news.But, sadly, this suffers from very poor execution. Poor music. Poor direction. Terrible acting. Even the photography just didn't seem to work. Dreadful script.Just a mess.It is billed as a drama. Or is this a comedy? If it's a comedy, are they really making comedy about sexual abuse?And Jennifer Aniston, oh dear. Rather than care about her character, I just found her really annoying. A super wealthy news anchor worried about losing her job. Who cares? Histrionics don't convince.And Reese Witherspoon - sightly better perhaps?But then we run into a ludicrous plot. Does anybody really get hired to a top job based on someone watching a 2 minute interview on TV?I think not.Having wanted to like this, I gave up after one episode.",7
"You elected Trump as president and complain about being political??","C'mon Americans!! You can't have your cake an eat it too!! This is a very clever and well written show, acted, produced and yes... a little political. When a reality star?!?!? Becomes the president of the United States Of America, outlets have a duty to respond to the dark comedy that have been thrust onto the world. There are some shows who take it to ridiculous extremes (I'm talking to you season 3 of The Good Fight) but this was more measured and realistic. Trump has changed the global landscape, there is nothing right now we ( the rest of the world) can do about that, until then, allow creatives from both side of the aisle the chance to use these platforms to put a voice to those of us who feel unheard. In summary, if you are looking for an entertaining and darkly comedic well scripted tv show. Give the Morning Show a chance...",8
"Commentary too often veers into rich privilege","The show has a strong cast and deals with a range of social issues covering race, gender, harrassment that are all relevant to a modern audience.However sometimes the nature of the controversy and the reactions of the characters is a little too close to petty and bitter.As an example, a waitress is pressured into licking spillage on a table for a $20,000 tip. And sure it is embarrassing and a bit unprofessional. But its also a silly prank (in bad taste) that is consented to and probably repeated a thousand times for fun at student parties across the world.In the real world ppl would do a lot more for less. Ppl clean toilets for minimum wage, have sex for $100 and leave their families for many months for jobs that pay less. The central character acts like she has witnessed a rape but she is just living in a spoilt community with bad manners.And so the show often loses credibility on social issues and devolves into looking like a show made by privileged ppl about their favorite subject...themselves.And of course, race is always dealt with in the hypocritical American way...every balck person is exploited, every whte person a racist who is guilty of things that happened 100s of years ago...A black 'comedian' tells her audience 'you all did it (slavery)' and we get a snapshot of the mood in the US for race shaming but this kind of show would never have the courage to say that slavery is a reality for many living in BAME communities today and it is only white communities that are even bothering to take inclusion seriously.And so we end up with a show that is well made, well acted , but not nearly as current or insightful as it tries to present itself.",7
"SEASON 1 WAS OK BUT SEASON 2 IS GARBAGE","I thought the first season was ok, not always enjoy it but ok. The plot was thick and they knew what they were doing. The shock at the end was good stuff. Completely mesmerized with Billy Crudup's performance. Not a favored to win contender but surely spiced up the award shows.Season 2 came and they want to talk about Covid. OK, i see they want to be The Newsroom (a show i really love for outstanding dialogues) so i was very hyped. But then OMG, how easily boring everything gets. With 2 years off for them to work and they can still manage to ruin everything of season 1. The plot is everywhere and nowhere (i wrote this review when i'm 6 episode in season 2), everybody just whining all the time and the ONLY interesting character is (of course) Billy Crudup. Alex is annoying, Bradley is stupid AND annoying and what is Mitch still doing here? Uninteresting woke plot with zero logic is Season 2.Stay away from this for your own good. Season 2 just proved that season 1's success was just a fluke.",1
"I like this","If you like Aniston in Horrible Bosses and Whiterspoon in Big Little Lies then you most likely will enjoy The Morning Show.",8
"GREAT start Apple TV+","Three episodes in and so far I love this show, my only annoyance is now having to wait to watch more. Fantastic story line executed brilliantly by Jennifer and Co. Can't wait to watch more. Highly recommend.",10
"Impressive acting!!","I gotta say, Reese and Jennifer's roles are outstanding. Some of these scenes are just jaw dropping and intelligent. Great job!!",8
"Apple TV is Knocking it Out of the Park","Every series I watch is great!!! Way to go, Apple TV.Love this show! The characters are so complex, and so much substance to them. Great acting by Billy Crudup. He is so captivating and stand out in this series. When he tells Bradley how he feels about her, such raw talent. I was mesmerized. Cudos to Steve Carell, Reese Witherspoon, Mark Duplass., Valeria Golino.When the show's timeline reached Jan 2020, it felt surreal reliving what the world went through. I really appreciate how the show's story was intertwined with that part of history during the pandemic.I am looking forward to the next season. The only downside is that I don't enjoy Jennifer Aniston's acting or character. But I am still enjoying the series and I recommend it!",10
"Epic !","The story so brilliant, and the acting without a doubt from top actors actresses. Hope they win all the nomination and award. Cant really wait for season 2.",10
"If only there was a rating higher than 10","This show is the top. I could not have enjoyed it more. I couldn't wait to watch each episode. Fantastic storyline, incredible acting from EVERY single person. Steve Carell is one of the most diversive actors I've ever seen. I'll be honest, Jennifer Aniston had always been ""Friends"" to me (which I loved) and I'd never really seen her in anything else but let me tell you; I was blown away with the depth she put into this character. Reese Witherspoon, well come on; it's Reese Witherspoon you really can't go wrong. You believed her character wholeheartedly. This was one of the best series I've ever watched (and Lord I've watched many). Polished to perfection.",10
"As feminist as possible","And I don't like it.I don't know if it is just me, but I'm so tired that most of television right know wants to ""educate"" us on their own particular opinion about politics.
To be honest, I understand that there are issues that we, as a society, have to talk about, but there is a balance that is lacking on this show.
On the show, every male character is just not important... Or men are just weak and have nothing admirable.
The show is slow and sometimes it feels we are watching a Democrats speech without any counter response.
It's lazy, and this is just so sad.. because this show has a spectacular cast, direction, photography and production... Bus I miss a, just as strong, conservative character to balance this feminist desperation.",6
"I like it","I didn't want to like it but I do. It's still not better than Newsweek with Jeff Daniels though. I love Reese for some reason, the screaming of honesty is a nice touch. To bad it doesn't s happen in RL.
The metoo thing scares the crap out of me though as a young single business owner , who also owns multiple properties. I have literally videotaped consent with everyone I've dated in the last 2 years for fear of making someone angry over a breakup or rejection and being sued or criminally charged.It's a scary time for both males and females in this world.",8
"More bad writing for Apple TV+","UPDATE. After the show begins to leave behind the metoo Today Show narrative it begins to come into its own. Some depth in minor characters starts to emerge but many leading roles are still dull, though the overall writing appears to step up above its early on pandering 'current events commentary'. I've updated my score to 6 stars, but only, as it still falls flat of many network dramas free over the airwaves with much smaller budgets.ORIGINAL EARLY IMPRESSION
They spared no expense for on screen talent but forgot about creating good scripts. The writing is so straight forward and simple. The characters have zero depth except for maybe reese's character. You don't feel any connection. The politics is just too much and too biased. There was very little comedic relief from the awkward emotional scenes and in your face social rants.I will likely push through as many episodes as are available in the first 7 day trial, but it's certainly not enough to bring me back at even a measly $5 per month. Even if this was free on network television, I doubt I would watch an entire season.Just meh...",6
"Season 2 nose-dived!","I had absolutely loved season 1... amazing performances and a tight script!WHAT WENT WRONG IN ONE YEAR!?Such a boring season 2... all that everyone is doing is just crying. Not one happy moment (except for 5 mins between Alex and Mitch). And who really cares about Bradley's brother? Putting it in a nutshell... they tried to address too many issues without focusing on any one. Black bias, gender bias, me too, strong anti trump agenda, climate change, LGBT, drug abuse, and yeah, COVID too! The script just lost its grip.We saw season 1 in a 3 day binge. I swear it's taking us a week to complete even one episode of season 2.And worst of all, jen has acted poorly. She has one gasping expression the whole season. SAD.",1
"#BingeWorrhy","I can't stop watching. It's a page turner. I feel like I know these people (the characters) and that we work together. I got totally immersed into the show and I want more. Excellent writing. Excellent acting. Fantastic current topics tastefully and thoughtfully presented. I am hopeful for more seasons. Well done!",10
"Great cast!","We didn't expect this to be a drama... it was riveting.My husband and I watched it for three (3) nights straight and looked forward to every episode.There were stories within stories that depicted the lives of the other characters.
Multi levels wove throughout the story and highlighted the exquisite talent of each actor.We always thought of Jennifer Aniston as a 'cute little comedic actress.'This role gave her the depth of a seasoned actor and she was brilliant. I owe her an apology and am now a forever fan. I look forward to seeing her in more dramatic roles. She was always cute, but now she's beautifulEvery actor brought her/his character to life.It'd be great if there could be a sequel.""The Morning Show"" is one of our favorites; bravo!",10
"Wow!","It took me a few episodes but Jennifer Aniston is phenomenal in the Morning Show! All the actors are really, but Jennifer carries it. While I agree with other reviewers, the political agenda is too thick at times; it doesn't detract from the storyline. I gave it an 8 stars, because of the ""preachiness"". However, the characters are well written and the story is compelling. Reese's character ""Bradley"" is one-note, but she keeps me interested enough to care how her story ends. Overall, a great watch!",8
"Season 1 is on the Mount Rushmore of all shows.","Season 1 is on of the greatest written, directed, acted, and presented seasons of all tv history. Razor sharp in all aspects and kept you craving for more. It is a 10+
This is what people in tv are capable of doing when you get the best people on the project and they are producing a product they are very much a part of.Now having said that, season 2 seems like a forced continuation that falls flat compared to the first season, even though it is still better than most of what can watch anywhere else. To sum it up....this is the bar where others need to strive for. Enjoy!",8
"Drama at its finest","One of the best shows on tv right now. The cast are excellent, just watch it.. 10/10.",10
"Jennifer and Reese shine","It's nice seeing Jennifer Aniston in a serious role. It makes me appreciate her acting ability, same goes for Reese Witherspoon. Very entertaining and intriguing. Not what I had expected from the previews. Great casting on the show. I'm sure this happens in the corporate world all the time. I'm only in the middle of the first season, but looking forward to see where this storyline goes. I highly recommend watching this series and I hope it continues to be picked up for future seasons. Too many good programs get cancelled before the entire story is revealed. Very impressed with the acting and the directing.",10
"Great season 1 blah season 2","Just started watching The morning Show. Amazing cast members and loved season 1, I was hooked. It was like a good book you couldn't put down. We just started season 2 and have yet to be impressed, actually finding it a bit of a turn off, and uninteresting. The entire story line in season two is very choppy, and was hard to follow at first. Almost like we missed a huge part of the story line and once you got it figured out it wasn't good. I checked reviews as I thought I can't be the only one who was unimpressed with season 2. I will give it a few more episodes, but looking at the reviews it doesn't look like it will improve.",6
"Wow!","I started watching The morning show and I was a little optimistic. After episode 2 I couldn't stop watching it and now I can not wait for season 2!! Absolutely fantastic!!!",10
"Watch This Show And Loose Weight!","Watch this show and loose weight... No really! Following the trend of other recent dramas to include Social Media and messaging integral to the plot, almost every shot of a phone screen has text so small that you will frequently be required to get up off your sofa and walk over to your TV so that you can myopically read what is on the screen. Not all of us have a TV screen the size of a garage door so is it really beyond the wit of the current batch of video editors to put something legible on a average sized TV? It's not rocket science. Bad videography will also have you frequently looking at a black screen for a supposed night shot! Maybe this is the product of wannabe cinematographers... well suck it up and accept you are making a tv show as you sure took the shine off what is otherwise one of the most original and compelling TV shows in recent times. This may be a career Best for Jennifer Aniston to date and the rest of the cast shine too.",7
"Drab prolonged storylines, lacks direction","Honestly was looking forward to this series but 2 seasons in now and i've lost interest.The same storyline and ensuing drama has been dragging on for over 20 episodes to date and there never seems to be any build up, anticipation or knife edge drama. Its basically hum drum with good actors that could have given it a comedic edge but that barrel has unfortunately been left untapped.",5
"One of the best shows on TV","This show is flawless. Both seasons 1 & 2 are television of a very high caliber. All of the acting is excellent, Jennifer Aniston is particularly magnetic on screen and Reece Witherspoon is equally as brilliant. I can't rate this show highly enough.",10
"Surprisingly fantastic","I'm just shocked, I'm just finished to watch the series (within one day....), and that was awesome. Honestly I expected that this will be a series made for women, but this was astoundingly well written, acted and meanfully story for everyone. I'm still under the influence of the last episode...
Strongly recommended category.",9
"Superb and nuanced","Billy Crudup is brilliant as are all the actors involved. A mature, complex and nuanced look at feminism and toxic masculinity. Interesting, funny and compelling it manages to steer clear of the usual cliche' and actually takes a fresh and balanced look at the issues surrounding the Me Too movement.Having watched all episodes a while back I fully intend to watch them all again at some point. Excellent TV show.",9
"This show has everything going for it!","Took me awhile to start to watch this show as I am not an Aniston fan nor a Steve Carrill one either BUT with all the raves going on about it I dived in. I bombed all the way through it in 3 days to catch up ... I couldn't stop from going to the next one then the next one until there was no more.First thought that immediately came to me was ... anybody think of Matt Lauer when it started ?? LOL What happened to him anyway.The whole cast is awesome and crushes every scene. Yes major kudos to Aniston, Witherspoon and Carrell but have to say LOVE LOVE LOVE Billy Crudup, Gugu Mbatha-Rawand and Mark Duplass ... just a stare or facial movement they convey so much. WOW oh WOWMy main thrill in watching this was the Cinematography .... and how camera angles were used, the way some scenes were filmed with back lightening, the winter scene etc. Knowing some scenes were not as they seemed as was the New Years Eve scene .... which was filmed in an open space with green screens surrounding them.Whether some of the story lines could be real or not is not for me to say but I have been in a studio audience when the host was severely taken down by the famous star she was interviewing as the host was more interested in her famous brother than her. Host was bloody and bruised.",8
"Jennifer Aniston's best on screen performance","Jennifer Aniston is absolutely flawless in this show. Her best performance ever. Season 2 has been a little slower than the first - but her performance has been captivating throughout.The whole cast is incredible - the dialogue is top notch and the narrative is fantastic.",9
"Bravo","Though, not quite as entertaining and enjoyable as Big Little Lies, very well written and acted show, and all around quality. The directing is good, music, everything is well done. The show is much better than the trailer portrays. I originally thought this was going to be yet one more about noble reporters waxing on about their importance and goodness. Barf. There's a reason that until recently journalist were on the top list of individuals regarded as parasitic, up there with lawyers and politicians. Sure, some are noble, and some do good, well researched work, but, most sell a story that is narrated in the direction the journalist or editors want, while only loosely based on an original truth. The integrity of news and journalism is up there with TMZ. Most of it is bs. Regardless, I do believe some want to tell the truth and believe in their job, which is where you get Bradley (Reese Witherspoon), who wants to do just that, and Alex (Jennifer Aniston), who has been in the business long enough to know it's a business.I looked at a lot of the low, 1-3 scored reviews, and they're clearly all from men who didn't watch the show, or who watched part of the pilot just to assure themselves they would hate it. Though, very few seemed to even do that. Again, this show wasn't written for you. Just like a shoe store devoted to women's shoes wasn't made for you. Do you go picket the women's shoe store and write bad reviews for it online? Get over yourselves. It is pretty clear that Twitter, Facebook, and the online universe is full of left wing and right wing types who are living on trust funds or still living with their parents and so have the abundance of time to devote themselves to the Internet to troll every website in order to bash anything that doesn't fall in with their own narcissistic, personal beliefs. I think it's funny that Reese's character has a meltdown over her exhaustion of those types. It felt very Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes where someone finally says what everyone is thinking.I like the fact the show is nuanced. Steve Carell's character, who is obviously based on Matt Lauer, is not your straight up predator like Weinstein. Well, I'm only 6 episodes in, so I suppose that could change. Funny thought, maybe the bad reviews are from NBC, since they protected and covered for not one but two predators, Weinstein and Matt Lauer. I mean, if Lauer got fired why Is Joe Scarborough still on the air, who has an equal reputation? I'm sure NBC and most studios are scrambling to double down their defenses since there are a long list of predators and they've long protected.The show is also nuanced in the fact that Reese Witherspoon's character's wants to do a news story about the rich hiring private firemen to protect their homes during a fire. I'm willing to bet Reese, Aniston and anyone responsible for this show would also hire private fire. And, since when is it a crime to hire off-duty firemen or police? Also, no one is poor in Malibu. It seems silly to say the super rich shouldn't be able to pay for off-duty fireman if the mildly wealthy can't afford it. Even if poor people, who can't afford it, did have the money, they would do the exact same thing and save their house, possessions, pets, family, and let everyone else burn. So, I didn't believe for a second that Reese, Aniston, the writers, producers, etc., would be so noble to not use their money to help themselves in a disaster. That was a bit much, but other than that this show is really good. It flows really well and has some great moments.",9
"A Lot stuff about MeeToo to bad it more about agenda than truth","Well it started ok, out of some good reasons, but quickly turned into something that got exploited, and heaven forbid you have a Pen since its not really MeeToo. So a show predicated on all of that from Hollywood pretty much is what you think... A deep subject that is handled very one sided, with an very feminist agenda.Now about the show even with all that love the stars of the show and if you go in knowing its got a leftist bent maybe you can find some sparks of honesty which is still more than Hollywood has done in the past.Not intending to watch season two way way to many reviews that seem to indicate it gets more leftist and the writers apparently just took a vacation.",7
"What. A. Show.","As Bette Davis once said ""fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy ride"".",10
"Yawned my way through it","I guess season 1 was borderline ok but season 2 is SUUUCH a draaag. It's like the writer went through film school, learned every rule in the book about screen writing and thought why don't I just consistently go against that. I mean I had to watch it at 1.5 speed because the pacing was so slow, my mind just wandered off because the dialogue presented very little actual relevant information to progress the plot or the characters. And even at 1.5x it was a draaag.",7
"From great to unwatchable","The first season was excellent as a very realistic, multi facetted, complex overall perspective of a very real modern day issue. I thought it was very well done, and still worth watching as a standalone season.The second season is a teenage drama of grown adults acting like children, with constant twists thrown in as an attempt to be shocking but it's just so tedious. It's become unwatchable and I'm having a hard time even finding time to get to the season finale. There's no chance that I'll be back for the third season.The entire cast are are all still really fantastic and doing a great job with what they're given, but the writing this season is absolutely horrible.If you watched the first season, do yourself a favour and stop there.",5
"Bravo","Great writer!!!But it was too loud... People yelled in anger in every episode, which makes me feel really tired.",9
"Fantastic characters (first season)","It's very hard to create a show that's exciting with a lot of dialogue. Where each scene can be a nail bitter. The Cory character might be one of the most interesting characters I have seen in a show. Fantastic acting on his part. Each time he's on screen you're interested. Even if sometimes you're trying to debate whether he is being sarcastic, clever or secretly a serial killer. Regardless you're interested. None of the other characters are shabby either. Great performance all around. Writing develops great. Slow at times but what show isn'tThen we get to the second season. I would drop the rating to a 6 if I didn't think the first season was so great. The characters make no sense anymore. The control and cleverness the Cory character had is out the window. He is no longer interesting. I think the writings might have accidentally done a replace all on Alex and Bradley. Over 8 months all of Bradley's ideals and principles have gone out the window and is now Alex. Alex who would have killed for her job now just gave it up to go live in the woods. It makes no sense and I hope it gets better again.",8
"Great show, end of season 1 was a bit meh though","Loved the show, can't wait for the next season. The only thing I thought was a bit weak, was how they ended season 1 in the last episode. Suddenly Alex makes a turn and agrees with Bradley, they team up and kick ass together in the final 5 minutes. I thought it was all rushed towards that moment a little too much. Like we need a happy end and we only have a few minutes. But all in all great show.",8
"Love this TVShow","The cast is perfect and along with the acting is too. The story is great and educational in some way. Apple did an amazing job.",10
"Got hooked after episode 1","Watched episode one and got hooked. Needed to know what happens next. Ended up really liking it. Jennifer Aniston at her best. Now time to start season 2 episode 1. 😉",8
"Great writing","They showed a massive Covid 19 Mask poster that didn't come out until April of 2021 in midtown Manhattan when it was before Covid was spreading and taking place in December 2019 and Covid barely on the radar so THAT was a little booboo. But if you get past that, as anyone should, it is really well written and great character writing. The acting is so outstanding. It can be a bit heavy at times so I can never binge, but it is just so good!",8
"Aniston is a miscast","I love this show! Love the story, love the drama, love the social relevance! I love everything about this except for Jennifer Aniston. I don't know, I adore her, but I quite don't see her in this role. I struggle to wrap my head around the fact that she's a famous morning show host. I just don't see it. Her hosting skill is subpar.",8
"Narcissistic but relevant","A parody of narcissistic self-promoting media people pretending to deliver the morning news to the citizens of this country. Real world social, economic and political issues are in the distant background as the most prevalent events are who is sleeping with home. Should have been a daytime soap. Doesn't touch the hypocrisy of the characters.",6
"Started strong, but a consistent decline season to season....","The first season was 10/10 amazing. I couldn't stop watching. Season 2, I was still invested, but not as interested in the plot. Just a few episodes into season 3, and I don't know if I'll finish this one. I genuinely detest when shows get political. It's not that I disagree with everything, but everyone has there own stance on issues. Instead of following the advice that UBA gives Bradley Jackson, they have done the exact opposite.Season 1 focused one one thing primarily. Season 2 added even more hot button issues, but was still palatable. Season 3? The first few episodes have so much happening, I don't even know where to start. I wanted to love this, but I have a bad taste in my mouth after season 3.",5
"More than Meets the Eye","I wasn't sure what to expect from this (first?) AppleTV production. Let me tell you, I just binge watched the first season (we are in quarantine so partially acceptable behavior), and I'm completely blown away.Not only was the acting on point, the cinematography amazing, and the plot absolutely enough to have you keep pressing ""next episode"" - the moral of the story and the end of the season was absolutely breathtaking.I think this was an incredible production and I'm curious if they take on a second season, what might happen on ""the morning show"". Definitely worth the watch.",10
"It scales up to greatness.","The show started ok, with great actors/actresses and beautiful scenarios, but it took 3 to 4 episodes for the storyline to develop, which as we know is quite a lot having in consideration the amount of good series that are being broadcasted in streaming services.
It is also true, that they kind of could afford this slow start because the star quality would keep almost anyone watching just to see how great Jennifer, Reese and everyone on the cast were acting (since ep. 1!!).
With all this, I can tell you that the season finale was one of the best ones I have seen so far. It was just great and the main reason why I'm giving this show a 9 and almost felt like giving it a 10.
It is very rare to see such difficult matters being discussed with such depth and truthfulness.
Can't wait to see what season 2 will bring us, and I really think that is going to be even better then the first one!",9
"Way better than I expected.","Wasn't sure why I even started watching this?, (I think I saw JA & RW on a few chat here in the UK).
Anyway, I'm so glad I did!
The cast is fantastic, the acting is on point, the story is enough to for me to keep wanting more.
Great to see Jack Davenport again!....(I know I am going to have to watch This Life as soon as I'm finished with this!",9
"Excellent Acting, Superior Cast","This is an excellent, original Apple production with a stellar cast. I was impressed that the show focused on the me too movement and handled it in a smart and realistic way. The plot is slightly thin but the acting and character development more than make up for it.",10
"Fierce women!!","Phenomenal show!! Fierce women who weren't given the power they deserve, so they had to take it! Love it! Absolutely brilliant this show! Amazing cast and script! Definitely 10 stars!",10
"Amazing","Please please make season 2 in a week !! Love it !!
Love Jennifer and Reese and all of them",9
"Best of Jennifer Aniston","3 episode in and I'm hooked. Something different than usual. Writing is superb as well. Never thought Jennifer Aniston was this good. Steve Carell also nailed his role. Overall very good watch.",7
"Too melodramatic","The first season was pretty good with a respectable cast and good storyline but the second season was a disappointment. I know this is a ""drama"" but it felt very soap opera-ish at times with so much melodrama. Honestly I don't know how this team puts on a morning show. They all seem to be driving off a cliff with every episode. They also squeezed too much woke storylines; me too, gender equality, race equality, women's rights, gay rights, work place harassment and you name it. It was included. It was overkill.On the plus side, Jennifer Anniston was fantastic in her role in both seasons. Billy Culdrup's acting was very good but his character got a little tiresome in the second season.",10
"I enjoyed it a lot!","Go watch it now!Fantastic case, great storyline, awesome editing and camera work, very high production values, what else can you want? Really enjoyed the first 3 episodes and I am definitely hungry for more.",7
"These People are not likeable","Paints a bad picture of corporate TV and angry stressed out women trying to prove themselves through angry confrontation.Slickly produced with a strong cast, good for a binge, but I worry that the characters and the storyline is getting repetitive and unlikeable.At times it's a bit 'much' all that money but no one seems remotely happy.",5
"Season 1 OK, Season 2 abysmal","Season 1 was decent. The plots were decent and the episodes flowed together well with a decent conclusion.Season 2 is just terrible. Plots feel forced, characters don't feel real nor a continuation of the same characters from season 1. It feels like they wrote it to have something and to give the actors something to maybe get awards for their performance. With some episodes I couldn't even make it through the episodes without turning it off and continuing it another day.",9
"Too many f-bombs...","The cursing in this show sort of reminds me of school where the teacher said I needed to write a full page report and so I double spaced the lines and scoured my thesaurus for long words! In some scenes the cursing works, but in others it falls flat and seems like padding because they ran out ideas.I know Jennifer Aniston is crazy popular, but personally I just don't quite get it. I find her acting to be a bit disconnected and certain expressions particularly wooden.Luckily Reese really grabbed my attention though. 100% believable in her role. For sure the best part about the show.Other standouts:Mark Duplass has frazzled down to a T and is so fun to watch.Billy Crudup is also doing a great job with being simultaneously bold/crazy/creepy/eccentric/who knows...",10
"Excellent Writing, Acting, Directing, Production","This show is SO well-written! I find it refreshing to see deep, very complicated characters who reveal the many subtle nuances of their psyches. They also show the numerous subtle nuances of how people arrive at decisions - taking into account their ambitions, their self-esteems, their duties/loyalties to people and to entities (large corporations), and so on. The acting is excellent: usually there are one or two actors that aren't that great, but every single one of these actors have fully committed to their characters, and they portray them convincingly. I enjoy how they are weaving in current events and topics, and therefore providing social commentary. I am really pleased that this show already got picked up for a second season. Bravo to everyone involved in this show!!!",10
"Wow!","This show is so good! The acting is brilliant and each ep had me hooked! The season finale was amazing and I honestly didn't want it to end! Recommended!!!",10
"Riveting.","Very rarely do I use the words ""enthralling"" or ""riveting"" regarding a tv show. Superb acting amongst the whole cast. Storyline is deep, dynamic, and well-rounded. The talent in casting, production, and directing is top notch.",10
"This Show and Jennifer Aniston are Sublime","This show kept surprising us. We could never guess where it was going, and every direction it took was multifaceted and enteraining, with each episode building the tension and cracking open the human desire to survive and how our perception of situations are totally built of personal experiences and aren't always as they seem. The entire cast are acting their socks off. And it is 100% Jennifer Aniston's most compelling, rollercoaster of emotions performance to date. She owns every single word her character speaks. She is sublime. The characters are so complex, none of them are just one type of person, you feel each and every one of their utter determination to survive even if it is flawed. But for all of the deep and moving drama, this show is packed with character driven humour too. This show is human, the good and the bad. Love love love!!",10
"Aniston is amazing, as well as rest stars.","Strong plot, amazing play of actors. Especially Jeniffer. She is awesome. So big variety of feelings. From deepest sad to strong powerfully person. Wow. I was shocked. Emmy and golden globe is waiting for her! Steve and Reeze are also great! Love their play and how they play their characters. Super show!!!",8
"Engaging enough but....","The premise is interesting if familiar. There is the usual cast of immoral characters. The how it all happens is really far fetched but it's a TV show. Four episodes in I'm not totally hooked but I'll keep watching. The weakest links are the leads. Reese Witherspoon is not a sympathetic actress and seems too old for the role even saying she's been around. Jennifer Aniston is one of those actors with a strong personality and no matter the part, she is always Rachel Green. It can be annoying as she can be so over the top and even when she's supposed to be truly upset, there's always the element of borderline slapstick. She just doesn't have a lot of range. Otherwise, it's okay.",7
"Too much prejudices around great TV show","According to reviews, people expected:
feel-good show like Ted Lassopolitical drama like Newsroomstudy of journalists everyday lifebreakthrough because of pretty big spendings.Then they disappointed and blamed the show as full of cliches. However this time problem with clishe is not behind the screen, but in viewer's mind. If you don't care about Aaron Sorkin, Rachel from Friends, Michael from Office, Apple TV ambitions, actors earnings and high noses of critics, you will find a lot of pleasure.Steve Carell and Jennifer Anniston are amazing: they both have proved themselves as drama actors. Jen joined the club of world's best actresses.Story is rich: you cannot pull out anything from 10 hours. Every scene and even every frame matters.Characters are interesting. My favorite are Chip - producer, who constantly building Morning Show's house of cards - and Kori, head of news department, who plots revolution. The last one sincere enjoy chaos and use it as staircase, like Varys advised. Billy Crudup fairly got Emmy for that.Every character take part in big story: global MeToo movement and corporate struggling with culture of silence. This game lead us to predictable but amazing climax. The end of season strongly reminds House of Cards and Mister Robot at their best.The Morning Show is not one of a kind, but it is a perfect product of cinematography art. It's very thoughtful as a whole and in details. If you don't let prejudices disturb you, you will love it.",10
"Intriguing, but over-dramatized at times","The behind-the curtain look at contemporary issues drew me in and was led by some all-stars. Definitely hooked me! There are some over-the-top dramatized sequences that feel like they could use the laughs we are used to getting from people like Carrell. My other complaint is the over-used 's that made me wonder how many times they had to drop the f-bomb to get an MA rating. The profanity feels forced, uncomfortable and takes away from the storyline.",7
"Season 1 is an 8. Season 2 is a 4.","While viewers can expect some vanity decisions in production and scene-time from main characters who are also executive producers, I feel Jennifer Anniston took that a tad too far. It was too obvious that she had her hairdresser at the ready for every one of her (too many) scenes: that iconic hairdo should have its own credit line. Never a hair out of place. Just too much.Season 1 really felt almost like a documentary (in a good way!), it was so reflective of current situations in morning shows reported in real life. Though it was written prior to the Matt Lauer scandal, it sure felt like the Matt Lauer scandal, and was riveting. Then they got carried away with their own success and produced a second season. Mistake. The compelling storylines of Season 1 devolved into soap opera kitsch. Complete with Italian palazzo and melodramatic car crash. I found myself literally laughing out loud at some of the scenes that are meant to be intense. It is cringey. (Alex in the car with Chip: embarrassing delivery).I guess we viewers are spoiled with excellent shows (both in terms of acting as well as writing) such as Scenes from a Marriage and The Chair, to name but two, so we have grown to be picky and why not. There are so many options on so many platforms, the decision to commit to a series should be rewarded with topnotch quality and zero regret on the use of our time.",5
"Perfectly pisses off everyone","Every bad review in here is butchering it for being liberal or far left. Every critic is slandering it for taking the mans perspective post #metoo movement, in defense of the critics, they at least watched more than 2 episodes.the only real gripe is some of the script work.",9
"Finally Something Fresh and REAL","I'm giving this a 9 out of 10 stars because this show is actually very interesting, well acted, well written and well directed. This TV series is obviously depicting the morning show scandal of Matt Lauer but it is all about the aftermath and how it affects the people around you...and how it changes things. When I saw the trailers, I was ready and armed to expect run of the mill power struggle in a network television but this show is much more. Jennifer Anniston has been perfectly casted for this role. She's pulled all the stops in this one and she's wearing several hats in this series from a famous News Anchor to a loving mom and a loving friend. Her character is portrayed is not weak but a struggling character who's really alone now and parrying attacks in this jungle of Showbiz/News world. I wasn't a Jennifer Aniston fan before, because her past roles weren't as powerful enough as they are in this series. I've always seen her in the cute girlfriend roles in the past. This series has revealed a different side of J.A. Steve Carell is also....there. It's just weird listening to him scream when he gets really angry in his roles...it's like he's still playing the role in The Office. Reese Witherspoon is great in this one. Her doesn't give a damn, small town gal personality gives this series a nice contrast. I can't wait to see what lies ahead...I've only watched 3 episodes and was taken away in a world where I want to spend more time in.",8
"Effin' fantastic!","""The Morning Show"" offers a rare two-sided perspective on harassment & misconduct at the workplace. I don't mean to dilute the show by saying that it's only about this problem. The show is able to address a wide variety of issues. What is consent? Does anyone working under a person of authority really have a personal agency? Are men victimized too? Why do people in the know keep quiet? Is looking down on any old guy-young girl relationship justified? I could go on.""The Morning Show"" never gets preachy in it's 10 episodes of almost 10 hour runtime. The writing is brilliant. All characters have personalities & feel like flesh & blood characters. The cinematography,the cross cuts,the direction & the performances of the entire ensemble are excellent to say the least. TMS is a very nuanced look into the happenings at almost all of our workplaces. It doesn't shove it's message down our throats. It doesn't turn away from opportunism. It just puts up a mirror for the corporate world.Drop everything else & watch TMS asap if you haven't already.",10
"Thought provoking, intelligent and entertaining","What a great series. Loved every episode. Sometimes funny, sometimes strange, sometimes tragic, sometimes cringeworthy but always intense.Brillantly acted from every single member of the cast. Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are brilliant, as is Steve Carell. The stand out is the supporting cast, just perfect. So well casted.Bravo Apple +, great start. More like this please.",8
"The BEST show!","I never write reviews but I decided to register for an account just so I could write The Morning Show review and let others know how fantastic this show is. It's well written, the acting is impeccable and you can tell how much effort was put into creating this show. I wait patiently ever week for the next episode to come out and I'm ready for season 2. This show is too good to pass up!!",10
"Great drama with tension, superb acting and writing - the whole package","The Morning Show's is a drama that follows the backstage (and backstabbing) ongoings of America's most popular morning show when one of the lead anchors faces an accusation of sexual abuse.Here's why I think this great drama is worth a watch.It tackles the Me Too theme in a very different way than most series have so far. Instead of depicting the accused - in this case, Morning Show's lead anchor Mitch Kessler (Steve Carrel) - as a cartoonish villain sexual predator, it gives him a lot of depth.The narrative doesn't force a narrative down the audience's throat, instead, it lets the viewer decide whether Mitch's rationalization around his wrongdoing is valid or not.Also, this show has incredible actors playing genuinely different characters.Carell plays perfectly the Me-Too-shunned anchor, who is a charming, lovable douchebag with a god-complex.Anniston - who plays Alex Levy, Carrel's character's co-anchor - really surprised me in her range. Despair, grief, rage and ambition all drip from Anniston's wonderful portrayal.Someone who really caught my eye was Billy Culdrup, who plays an enigmatic network executive. In the midst of a star-studded cast, his character manages to steal the show very often with memorable lines and hard-to-crack motivations.I could write a 10-minute long article on The Morning Show's actors alone, but don't just take my word for it - 5(!) actors from the cast were nominated for acting Emmy's, with the aforementioned Billy Culdrup taking home the prize for his Cory Ellison.Lastly, for a show that falls in the Drama category, The Morning show is riddled with tension and confrontation.Awkward silences, shouting contest and accusatory rants all make an appearance in this very well-written show.The Morning Show works on every well - production, writing, acting, you name it. Even the theme song is on point.Surely Apple+'s magnum opus so far and definitely worth a watch.",9
"Meh start","I wouldn't say anything is awful about this movie. Witherspoon and Aniston are quite good as TV journalists. The premise of #MeToo-inspired chaos is current and has potential.But there's a general blandness about it all. The similar series ""The Newsroom"" was often a mess and went off in weird directions, but it had a vision and a point of view. The Morning Show seems to just grind through the story because there's a story, there are actors, and well, you might as well do something with them.I'll admit there's potential. And based on a look at a plot synopsis, the series takes its MeToo premise seriously, rather than just as a way to kick things off, so if that's true kudos. But at the end of the first episode there was simply nothing that made me want to watch a second.",6
"Smart writing and GREAT acting","This show will win some awards. I signed up for Apple + just to watch it and binged on 7 shows and can't wait for the next 4. The story is brilliant, the acting superb, and they walk a fine line around politics. The trailer doesn't do it any justice. 10 Stars.",9
"Umm","I just wish imdb wouldd separate the rating for each season.So anyway,
Season 1 was the best.Season 2 was a big oh no.*The six out of ten is mostly for Billy Crudup acting.*But season 3?Feels like someone is out of ideas and decided to borrow the storyline from real events like the wealthy investor taking over the worldbut i cannot stop thinking about this: Since they keep mentioning real events like the pandemic in the second season and the Russo-Ukrainian War in the third season, I am curious to know if they have the gut to mention the aggression on palest!ne in the next season..",6
"Disappointing","I was looking forward to the new season and am disappointed with the blatant political slant that's so much more focused this season. I loved the previous episodes, which were smart and well written. There was some humor and lightness mixed in with the heavy drama. I thought the cast was fantastic. Now, it's become so much more political. And melodramatic, and the scripts are predictable and dull. Stereotypes all over the place.It's like the characters are taken from network television drama stereotypes and embellished with lush sets, dark lighting, and speed editing and the fading lustre of Aniston and Witherspoon. The characters are like paper dolls, with dialogue and emoting timed down to the second, mired in cliches.",2
"Absolutely amazing!!!!","This is the first show I watched on Apple TV and wow!!! I can honestly say this is one of the TOP programmes I have EVER watched. I'm not one for writing reviews but due to this programme being so incredibly intense, interesting and engaging from the very beginning I felt I had to get my view across! Great actors great story line! Most inportantly let's not forget about the basis of this series. The real issues of our society. I take my hat off to you. Amazing work! Incredible production!",10
"Hooked from the first second...","Jennifer & Reese are perfect in their roles along with the rest of the amazing cast.
Can't wait for the next episodes.",10
"Fantastic engaging television","Hooked every minute. Acting is brilliant, character build up is spot on. Artistic magic.",10
"Very good show","I feel like i'm not in the demographic to like this show but i totally do. Jennifer and Reese are super good in their roles. The show after episode 2 reallly gets going and get really less woke political (episode 1 reaaally didn't impress me with the social political problems checklist they had) but after that i felt like you get Mitch side of the story really well and they try to make points on both side of the coin they did not make him just an evil disgusting guy. I also like the fact that there a debate on the show of what's the line between news and entertainment.
Anyway watch at least the 4 first episodes to set your mind on this i swear it get really good over time.",9
"Really good!","This show is really well done and really well acted. Jennifer Aniston is great, the whole cast is great. I think Billy Crudup is so amazing on this roll! I'm obsessed.",10
"Unfulfilled Potential","Is it just me or does the story just play into the catty women scenario? It's no fun to watch, that much I can say for sure. I want to throw a bucket of cold water on both of them and tell them to grow up. There is nothing very difficult about working together on a project, even if you don't like the other person. Just do your damn job. Or are women too emotional to put aside petty grievances to work together? Because this is what I am taking away from this. I thought it was going to be about empowering women.Reese Witherspoon is all wrong for the part. Almost everyone else nails it, some of the bit players are better than the stars, like Reese's new producer and the story scout (sorry, don't know names-they both should or will be stars). Reese is just too dumpy for this role. Don't they have pilates in her neck of Hollywood? I can imagine so many other talented actors in this role.At the beginning, the show is a lot of fun even though it sheds light on a world I care nothing about. A morning news program? Eeew! I can't imagine how or why anyone would watch that sort of piffle. Ditto that for TV news in general. Still, I was enjoying the story through the fourth episode. I was anxious to see how they would address the whole #MeToo thing. They began with a few good points on the subject.Every time Mindy Kaling came on, I wanted to throw something at the screen. Her constant harping about the whiteness of her TV rivals I found to be insulting, as if being a different skin color somehow makes you superior.The drama surrounding the news stories The Morning Show will and won't produce is a ridiculous plot device. TV news is mostly garbage, everyone already knows that, so why does Witherspoon's character act like she is hearing this for the first time? TV news would never report on anything that would upset their sponsors. That's just the way it is. Get over it.And please, please can we get more scenes of an utterly spoiled teenage daughter who treats her mother like some guy screaming obscenities at her from a construction site? I love that. Always. File it under abysmal parenting. You raised a particularly horrible kid. Live with it. Cut her off, let the little creep make it on her own, because the very last thing this world needs right now is an over-privileged brat who will step to the head of the line without waiting, like waiting for infinitely more qualified kids to earn their way to the top.The worst thing about The Morning Show is that in seven episodes there was never much in the way of dramatic moments. Drama, yes, like soap opera drama. Women breaking down in hysterics is not really drama, it's clichés plagiarized from other TV melodramas.The way the series has been rolled out is a mystery. Why would they release the episodes at their leisure instead of dropping the entire season in one swoop so viewers can watch it at THEIR leisure? I also see how they are hemming and hawing at the story so they can spin it into another season, instead of just telling a single story. I really hate that about TV. If you have a story to tell, tell it. Don't beat around the bush as you consider ways to stretch it out so you can run it for years to come.",7
"Solid","This is a really solid program. I think the second series is much better than the first and after 7 episodes in, they've got me wanting ... and waiting for more. It's fun of twist and current affairs that make the show seem you are watching it in real time. Fantastic cast, too.",8
"Fantastic show, Jen truly shines","Absolutely loved this show. The story is gripping and very actual. Actors are amazing, they truly bring their characters to life. Especially Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Billy Crudupp and Steve Carell. But everyone else is fantastic too. So pleased that we are getting series 2 soon. Highly recommended.",6
"Gone from fabulous to forgettable","Season one was clever. The characters were all amazing. The storyline was engaging. Season 2 is nothing but woke propaganda. So incredibly disappointed. There are better shows streaming. Don't waste your time. Moving on!!!",1
"A solid start 👍🏻","Brilliant acting. Brilliant cast. Brilliant start.Yes, the first episode has a slow start but once you get through the three episodes you will become addicted. I personally can't wait to watch more of this show.PS how are people leaving reviews for this show after just watching the first episode? Give it a chance. It's a grower.",9
"What a screenplay!!!","Great show, great acting, amazing screenplay.
The first three episodes are almost perfect.",8
"Really Good!","It is really good! I hear that it is getting bad reviews?! For what? Jennifer Aniston is acting her ass off. Reese Witherspoon is very good also, Billy Crudup is so charismatic and strong acting. I just don't like the fact I can't bingewatch it. I don't understand Apple. They already have not much content to start with, just don't get it. The whole cast is good. I read somewhere that the show fails to choose sides, or that it doesn't know where it wants to go? Bull. My suspicion is that the competition is behind these reviews? Of course the show could collapse somewhere along the next 7 episodes, like Lost did famously in the past. But I don't see why. Charismatic, nice well acted and well produced show. Don't read the reviews just watch and make your own review.",10
"Excellent characters","I find the characters on this showing really interesting. By the end of episode 3 you are absolutely hooked. Kinda Like succession in that way. It takes a couple of episodes but when it connects, you really just want to see more.",10
"Not convinced yet, but..","I'm watching the pilot as we speak and half way. I'm not convinced yet, there is a lot a shouting at this point. There's also a lot of speaking to Amerika, what Amerika wants etcetera, but there's no feeling (yet). Please let this be a good show, because I like Jennifer back on the screen, it's really revealing and a must. :) She is playing the role outstanding!Edit: the connection is coming :)",8
"Engaging","Incredibly current and relevant. The juxtaposition of the two female leads exploring female relationships the work place and personal ethical stances. This is echoed through out the rest of the characters bringing other topics such as age, power and identity. So far on episode 4 and every time it ends I want more.",10
"Make sure you have your Advil bottle close by!","If you're looking for a headache, or want to watch a show where people look at their phone while they watch this... you're in luck!!!
Casting is backwards, writing is all over the place. It will give you a nice headache while figuring this out guaranteed!
Too many characters and not enough substance.
To people who are rating high I would like to say... stop wasting our time with your terrible taste in shows! This is a jambalaya of shows already made before, turned into word vomit!",6
"This show is great. I Don't think critics can be trusted anymore.","This had so many middling reviews that I almost didn't bother.
I'm glad I did. The acting and storytelling are excellent all around.
Maybe it's a political thing, because it does try to show both side's
perspectives of the MeToo debate, which is kind of forbidden
in much of the media these days.",10
"Do People Really Curse This Much In Reality","Generally the show is good - the characters, their relationships and the unfolding storylines are well enough developed and interesting to keep you tuning in to see where it's all going. However all the strengths of the show are blunted by the constant overuse of profanities. I'm not a prude, and understand that many people do speak in a similar fashion in the real world. But every other word in the show is f@?! or worse. Is this really necessary? Does the show's writer have such a poor grasp of English that they have to revert to such jarringly bad language to let the characters to express themselves. Disappointing as the show is otherwise good.",6
"Watch Season 1 and call it good.","Season 1 was easily a 10 out of 10. Kept me guessing, edge of your seat TV. But then season 2 became all about pushing so many agendas and just wasn't fun any more. Watch the first seasons and call it good. You won't be sorry.",5
"Really good!","Loved it! Episode 1-3 were okay, but after that it was really well told. Strong how they pointed out all the different perspectives of the topic. Exciting till the end",9
"Good morning Apple TV","The morning show was not the show I was most excited for when Apple announced the new Apple TV+ shows. But it is my favorite show on there! It's one of the best tings I've seen from Jennifer Anniston. And it keeps me longing for the next episode! Great show!",9
"Great Story Telling","This show has a amazing amount of truth. Sexual predators hide in plane site, sadly we all know them and if and when you find out someone you know is one you will probably be in shock as most are very good a deceiving those around them. Look at the story of Graham James, he was right under everyone nose for years abusing teenage boys, sadly these stories are not hard to find.",10
"10' after finishing season 1st","Masterpiece. Please finish the season to have an opinion. One of the best Tv shows... Meaningful, exposes true and inspiring...and unexpected turn og events... Well done!!!!",10
"Truly brilliant","Simply one of the best shows I have seen in years. Brilliantly scripted, beautifully short and some outstanding acting from every cast member. I went on such an emotional journey with each character never being sure whether I loved them or hated them.I cried so much at the end both because of tragically beautiful the ending was and also because I didn't want it to end.I cant wait for season 2. Such a shame it is broadcast on Apple TV so not more people get to see it.",10
"Amazingly Addictive","It is rare these days to find a good and addictive show to watch. This is amazing, with a fab cast. Definitely earned its 10 stars from me.",9
"Outright Excellence","Wow, just finished up season 1 and I'm left with wow !! Do not pass on this folks. This is as high a quality drama as you will ever watch. Simply outstanding !!",7
"Are we supposed to like Bradley?","We haven't finished the season yet, but Bradley just becomes more and more unlikeable. Maybe I'm just not 'woke' enough to appreciate her perspective.",10
"This is how 10/10 TV show looks like","First of all I want to say that there is a lady named Victoria Thomas, who I belive is responsible for the casting of The Morning Show and she did one hell of a job. Every single person acting in this series is exactly where they are supposed to be. I've seen a lot, but never something so perfectly done like this. Creators Jay Carson and Kerry Ehrin made this 10 episodes TV show something you want to sit and watch in one day. It's so engaging that I really can't wait for the second season. What those people did is that they showed everyone how dialogs on screen should look like. Other than that this series can help raise awareness of the crimes being committed as we speak.
I would like to call it perfect job done by professionals for the people who know how to appreciate great things in life.",6
"Good Premise ..... Limited Writing","Was keen to see this show mainly because of Aniston and Witherspoon, both of whom turned out to be the best things in it. The idea is gripping and topical considering what's going on in the media. However any of the show's good qualities are completely dulled and overshadowed by the proliferation of profanities and swearing which make up nearly every other word. Does the writer of the show know no other word than F? I see no one else picks up on this so maybe I'm a prude but such limited grasp of the English language is boring and quite honestly off putting. Which is a shame as everything else about the show is sharp and clever.",4
"Crap","I saw all the 8,9,10 star reviews on imdb so decided to check the show out. Now i'm convinced those reviewers work for the production company.Weak and cliche writing with middling acting. The show tries to be clever, hard hitting and engaging but falls flat.Critics have not been kind to this show for good reason.",9
"Just Brilliant.","I got Apple TV with my new phone so thought I'd suss it out and stumbled across this show. Well 2 days later 8 was done with all 10 eps. It was Brilliant. The acting ...wow. The photography was stunning. Anniston and Witherspoon are brilliant.",10
"WHAT AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE BY JENNIFER ANISTON.","Jennifer Aniston completely steals the show as Alex Levy. She completely gets into her character displaying the vulnerabilities as well as the strength of her character. Her dialogue delivery and her monologues are amazing. She chose a good TV Show after FRIENDS. The story is about a morning show as one of the co-hosts is fired on MeeToo charges. Reese Witherspoon is also good as Bradley Jackson.",9
"What a show this was !","Powerful acting and writing but could have done a better job avoiding some cliched characters.Steve Carell should have stuck with making ""That's What She Said"" jokes which was also inappropriate to say at a workplace. He went far and got fired.Aniston no matter how she acts somewhere feels like she's still playing Rachel from Friends. Hope she brings more ruthlessness to her persona in the next season.Reese Witherspoon acted out for her 2 million per episode pay but should still bring more variety. Probably it's just me expecting more from her.The pick of the series is the Emmy Award Winner Billy Crudup. His and Mark Duplass's characters are Wonderfully written. Especially Billy's cause you never know if he's a good guy or a bad
Guy till you reach a few episodes down the line.",8
"Starts off weak, then delivers","What a great cast. Not just the big names, but every single player delivers.
The first couple eps were very uneven, both in writing and direction, and we were tempted to drop it.
But it kept getting better and tighter with every ep.
Reese kills the 1st ep, but Jennifer and Steve each have their moments in following eps. Finally Jennifer is in a good project.
Karen Pittman and Gugu Mbatha-Raw both have extremely strong eps.
I love when smaller parts are given room to breathe and take flight.",10
"Jennifer's acting at its TOP!!!!","An amazing series about #metoo following real events in US with Jennifer Aniston & Reese Witherspoon at their best acting I've ever seen!The last 2 episodes just blew my mind! Well done Appletv+
We want more series and productions like this one!!",8
"If you expect Jennifer Aniston & Reese Witherspoon to reprise their sisterhood from friends...","This ain't that.This also isn't The Newsroom from 10 years ago or so.This is very good though.The casting of the main rolls to performers that traditionally not know for such rolls was a refreshing little juxtaposition move.I was disappointed by the unnecessary creation or conversion of lesbian characters. I guess not even Apple can make a stand against the powers that are dictating their agenda down the throats of Americans. This was not as vile as the recent Apple movie with Justin Timberlake.Jennifer Aniston is amazing. She plays her role exactly as we all likely imagine the real world is for people in such positions.Steve Carrell in such a serious role was another enjoyable departure from the norm.In the ending of season 3, I was shocked that the show depicted the January 6th 2021 US Capital protests in such reality, clearly pointing out the injustice in the extensive use of the word terrorist to describe every day Americans protesting....injustice.",10
"Excellent show... if you're numb to cussing","We watched episode one. It was a superb drama. A lot like Newsroom. But there was way too much cussing. We tried to get past it but couldn't.I love seeing ""comedic"" actors demonstrate that they cannot be pigeonholed.",6
"OMG fantastic!","I have to say, everyone is good in this but I have to give a special shout out to Tom Irwin. He is just so good as Fred. Everyone's acting is spectacular. I wonder what Matt Lauer thinks of this. Gosh Jennifer Aniston is good. I'm just blown away. The plot is exciting. There are all these undercurrents of emotion, wow I love it! Top of their game, everybody!",10
"curious where this leads","A topic where you can do a lot of things right but also a lot of things wrong. I liked the first three episodes but I am also curious where this leads.
1 star is not deserved in any way as well as 10 stars is a bit over the top. I guess this ist mainly due to the company behind this production. Unfortunately a lot of fan base clash going on here.",7
"Season 2 is far too woke","Season One was great. However, every second scene is season two involves a straight white male being targeted, or a minority feeling/being picked on, or a feminist rant, or them exploring some other 2020s wokism. It's way too much. It's like they've taken every social justice cause and crammed it into a season - relentless.It really is genuinely tiresome. We have switched off for good now (mid season 2) which is a real shame - this show wastes a brilliant cast and has some great potential. I wish the writers would recognise that less is more.On the whole, I couldn't recommend this. Even the wokest of us (I.e. My better half) finds it laborious.",1
"Surprisingly Good","Not something I thought Id like, but its just quality from the start. The last episode leads to a stunning climax!",8
"Sensational show","Everything about this show is outstanding. The acting especially. Jen An has grown so much as an actor, it was stunning to watch. Every episode was gripping and thought provoking. An incredibly show, I enjoyed every minute.",10
"Gripping BINGE-WORTHY drama from frame one to final frame; Aniston is Amazing!","I love love love season one of The Morning Show. Grade: A. The story line, the actors, the writing, all fantastic (I have watched the final 9:40 of the last ep 10 times now, I love it so much!) A couple of friends who said they didn't like it, I caught them off guard and asked about certain things in the show and they couldn't answer. Proving the never fully watched it. Beware of those friends who pretend to watch the entire season.Follow RT Audience scores (93%) and IMDB score (8.4) on this one. This show must be watched from start to finish. Hurry up season 2!",10
"Can't miss","The series version of Bombshell.
Woman's body commodification told with grate acting, and an absorbing story that I could't stop watching, episode after episode, and that left me astonished, indignate and almost exhausted, after realizing such a crude reality that I only vaguely imagined.",9
"INCREDIBLE!","This show is amazing. One of the best shows I have ever seen. A+ acting out of the entire cast. They all give oscar worth performances. This show is a must watch!",10
"Holy wow. Just wow.","I let this be for a long time, as i didn't think anything highly of it.
Episode 1 was... fine I gues... But my goodness, this is fantastic. The casting is brilliant. It is as everyone is acting the part they were always supposed to act. And the way to balance the metoo paradox from both sides is incredible. Wow. This is one of the best shows I have ever seen.",10
"Prestige Drama that is also Over the Top","If Mad Men and Smash had a baby, this would be it. I expected it to be awful but sm thoroughly enjoying it, except when it radiates self importance and flys off the rails with characters' unwanted soliloquies. The name of the show should be TMI because the characters consistently overshare in response to basic questions. I really appreciate Aniston & Witherspoon's performances though, it's nice to see two actresses at the top of their game in such meaty roles. Maybe season 2 will be better but I don't regret this binge.",7
"High quality and intelligent entertainment.","Jennifer Aniston has proved once and for all that she can do serious. She does serious extremely well in this series. Watching her and Reese Witherspoon ( 2 of ""America's Sweethearts"") Makes me feel sad for Meg Ryan. She ached for a roll like this but couldn't pull one off. Anyway, this show is basically a nod to the #metoomovement and its ramifications for everyone: The good and the bad. It goes into depth but I never once thought that I was being force fed diatribe by a Left Wing Progressive studio trying to shut me up. I have never had any sort of physical relations with an underling in my life but I have witnessed promotions to female soldiers in the 80's who kept quiet about such things happening to them and they went on as if nothing happened.Enough of that. This is a great show and I only gave it a 9 because in IMHO there were faaaaaaaaaar too many ""F"" bombs dropped during its run. But what I liked best was how everything was wrapped up to end as a great mini series; but yet, it can just as easily continue for a second season. The show was very well developed and was produced to perfection which, when you consider how many different producers this show has, is an accomplishment in and of itself.",9
"Season 1 is Great...","Season 2 in a confused mess. While season 1 has a primary plot driver. Season 2 tries to address so many social issues, COVID, and the fall out from season 1. Hope season 3 can right the ship.",7
"A Tale of Two Seasons","Season 1 was like a beautiful meal you have at 3 Michelin Star restaurant. And Season 2 is like the food poisoning you wake up with from it the next day. Except the food poisoning makes you barf less.",4
"Even better on a second watch","I only come to really appreciate how good this show was second time around. It looks at the metoo moment in a really nuanced way from both sides both the victim and perpetrator. Steve Carrell is truly exceptional in this role and everyone across the board is good. i particularly liked Mark Duplass and Billy Crudup. Cannot wait for season 2. I think this show has so much better.",9
"Just wow","Hands down may be the my favorite show ever, like it's up there beside game of thrones for me! I really hope season 2 is as good as season 1, but it'll be tough to beat. Just wow. I'm at a loss for words, it's the best show on any platform. The closest thing to it right now is Queen's Gambit.",10
"Awesome show!","Great writing! Awesome storyline! Must see! Can't wait for season 2!",10
"This show is amazing!","Extremely well put together! Billy Crudup's character is my favorite! This guy should be the new (current day) Joker!!",10
"Season 3 Review","It feels like they did so much this season: It was a great addition having Jon Hamm, in such a divisive role. The tech giant trying to buy the media, which could be seen as portraying Elon Musk and what happened with twitter. How they managed to make the flashbacks so enticing with the story of Storming the Capitol ( being an underlying plot point) to the Overturning of Roe V Wade or the George Floyd Protests. I really was rooting for Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) and Paul Marks (Jon Hamm) in their ability to start a new company from the ground up, which made it so disheartening when it was ripped away.In summary I thought this was starting to wrap up and I'm quite shocked to hear that their could be a Season 4.",10
"New perspective with thrilling events and emotions","Lots of events happening behind the scenes of a morning show that we only see what they want us to see, perfection and happiness are not the vibes that truly invades the backstage of a show. New perspective to see things and to follow the life of fame.",10
"Trust","Season one was thoughtful and multi-dimensional. Season two--not so much. As others have noted elsewhere, there was too much effort being extended by the writers to better the previous season. It turned out, in many ways to be ungainly and awkward. I nearly gave up and to be honest, skipped to the final episode of season two, having lost trust in the direction the writers were going. While the final episode was a marked improvement, I'm not sure it did enough to make me interested in a season three. Let's just say The Morning Show is no longer on the must see list for me.",6
"Reece, Jennifer and Steve knocked it out of the park","As the heading suggests the performs each surprised me and if there was any questions about each of their acting range or rather limits of capabilities of roles, this has answered. The three of them dominate and compliment each other at the same time. The characters each give such a realistic portrayal of what may happen behind the Scenes of a news network. The politics, the drama, the Racism & the sexism, all behind the smoke screen that we the viewers see on air. The bigger story here and one that is perhaps less transparent but still addressed is the problem with TV media as a whole and it's inability to address real issues.
This is a fantastic series to watch and one I'm thoroughly enjoying",8
"Acting?","A look into the narcissistic world of morning TV replete of self asbsorbed characters with heightened self opinions. The acting of Anniston, duplass and Carell is beyond horrendous and is simply unwatchable. Thankfully the rest of the cast, especially Witherspoon, Marguilies, Cudrup, rescue this mess.",6
"I liked the first season, but second is very boring","The first season had a lot of action. Pretty much each episode was fascinating to watch.The second season feels very different. It feels like another person directed it. It is super dull, and there is no action in any episodes.At first, I thought maybe only the first or second felt like that and expected some changes in the future episodes, but it is episode 5 already aired, and I am not impressed.",4
"Best drama series ever","By far the best drama series I've ever watched. It's sure partly due to the environment, as I find it more interesting than most, but anyway the series should be acknowledged as the extremely well made with Oscar winner and other well established actors.",10
"What a gem!","Mid-September 2021 can't come soon enough so we can get going with Season 2. The story, the cast, and the acting are stellar. I appreciate Aniston's ability to not incorporate any Rachel into her Alex character. Can't say the same about Witherspoon as I see a lot of Elle Woods in Bradley. No worries though. The chemistry between the leading ladies is awesome, as are their interactions with all the other characters. Weaving Carell's character in and out of the story works well.",10
"Even better second time around","This show really is top quality. It was even better second time around when i could focus more on the script and the themes threaded through the episode. Top class performances all round and excellent music. Highly recommended. Can't wait for season 2. If they do it well, i think the show could stick around for a long time, they just need to invest in some excellent secondary characters and relationships such as Mark Duplass and his assistant who have fabulous chemistry and deserve more screen time together",9
"The Best TV show about sexual harassment .","Definitely the best TV show to demonstrate how sexual harassment could turn a wonderful life to an unbearable misery. It addressed perfectly and I would love to see more of this great show on next seasons. Indeed, there's a long way to eradicate this devastating culture but I believe the more publicity about this matter, the better to bring the voice load and clear that ""Time's Up"".",9
"Top class acting.","Probably, Jen's best performance. She's is doing positive when comes to serious acting.",10
"Why?!","After all the hideous flops this woman caused, why on earth would anybody risk to jeopardize this (although a bit forced on the pc side) potentially entertaining new series by casting Jennifer Aniston as the lead role? Which means she gets lots of close ups. Its hard...",8
"Great show but","I started watching this show, and it pleased me a lot, although it has some political connotation, it is well done and the Cast is quite good just a defect for those who see subtitled films, subtitles exist only for hearing impaired",6
"Billy Crudup!!","Billy Crudup makes the show really watchable for me. His screen presence and what he does with his role is amazing. I can never tell if he is a positive character or a negative character in the show. But the show is better because of him. Steve Carell's character is well written.Jen Aniston's character always seems to be grieving over something.I don't find the plot very convincing sometimes. While I understand Alex and Bradley are the leading characters of the show, I am not convinced how conveniently they end up saving everything.I hope season4 is better and they don't end Billy Crudup's character.",10
"Great Show...Now We KNOW it's true..","Great show. In my very humble opinion, Jennifer Aniston is GREAT in this because she's NOT ACTING. I think she's basically playing ""herself""! A snobby, overindulged, member of the ""Beautiful People""... It's no stretch at all for her. IT IS HER!! Now we know it's true - she is a BIG BIZNATCH!!BILLY CRUDUP RULES IN THIS SHOW!!!",7
"Season 2 was","I was all in on Season One, which i thought did most things well. Season Two however was jam packed with so many ideas and drama it just loses control and focus. Drama is constantly created about issues about Drug addiction, family, bisexuality, unrequited love interests, racism, social media, corporate disasters, cancel culture, suicide and Covid, Covid and more Covid.Steve Carrell is the best thing in the show and they make some decisions that put an end to all the possible great story lines. The frustration of it all made me feel like I should have been in the writers room to set them straight.",3
"Season 3 was appalling.","Loved season 1- moving, political and meaningful. Season 2 was okay-ish. Season 3 was unbearably bad. So bad that has made me
change my rating from an 8 after the first season to a 3 and has also made me want to write a review! Poorly directed- acting was shocking. It seemed that there was no chemistry between Jon Hamm and Jennifer Anniston which is fine but they couldn't even cover it up with good performance. The close up shots of Jennifer Anniston whilst she was trying to look upset was just cringe worthy. Last episode was appalling, so cheesy and melodramatic. Did not enjoy season 3 at all. It was a waste of time.",9
"I'm loving this show....","Two words Witherspoon and Aniston together they are absolutely phenomenal and i couldn't stop watching them. Nice to see a show that is not rapped up in violence and its very clever of Apple to involve the MeToo topic.",10
"Is Jennifer Aniston a natural anchor?","The most impeccable acting performance from Aniston, Witherspoon, and Carell, I've ever seen from each. The emotions are real. I was gripped immediately from the the first opening scene. The fourth episode left us with shock, it was unpredictable. Witherspoon's character is super unpredictable. Incredible series and deserves a 10. It's super political, I tend to stay away from politics, but seeing the perspective from both sides makes it worth it. It's not one-sided, but split down the middle.",10
"Now this is catching me !","This series draws you in one episode at a time
I have to say for me as a young adult of just 20 years old only a few series catch my interest and this is one of them !
I put this series at the top of my list above my other favorite which is suits .
This series catches your attention and draws you in !
Watch to the end it will not disappoint.I enjoy the length of the episodes and how much thought goes into each episode .
I truly enjoy how it builds on each episodeI truly enjoy that it is confused on the lives of each employee too !
Truly brilliant actors within this show",10
"Brilliant and Timely Show Exploring ""Me Too"" Movement","I've enjoyed this whole season. The drama has engaged me thoroughly while I also couldn't help noticing gorgeous sets, on point music, and stellar performances. The twists and turns were brilliantly breathtaking. I can't wait to see what happens in season two.Beware of reviewers complaining the show is too ""me too"". That's literally the point of the show. If you have something against the ""me too"" movement you will not like the content of show. Not personally liking the content does not mean the show is bad.",10
"Excellent !","This is easily one of the most relevant, thought-provoking shows of the decade. I look forward to seeing where it goes. I highly recommend watching it. Just, not with children.",9
"Very good, not as expected!","Critical reviews I read before it became public made me think I was wasting my time. Very well written and acted. Nothing disappointed. A solid 9 for me. Thank you Apple and the fine cast.",6
"Watchable soap opera that good be far better","With the exception of episode 8, season 1, this is a very fluffy and silly time passer...great cast-all capable-but there is nothing memorable here (except some of the most awful hair styling in series history). Just missing that extra something to make me want to continue with another season.",9
"Jennifer Seriousness is can take your heart by surprise. Ive been journalist thestoryis very close to tv journalist","Can take you heart by surpriseJennifer Seriousness is can take your heart by surprise. Ive been journalist thestoryis very close to tv journalist",6
"Likeable show but it gets stale","After the first 3 or 4 episodes I posted on FB a thank you to a friend who recommended I watch it after I asked for Apple TV+ showsuggestions since I had a free 3 months. I thought the show was terrific, especially Reese Whiterspoon's performance. I was never a huge fan of hers even though I loved her in ""Freeway"" a film from 1996. But in this she is terrific.The series gets old. It's all about neurotic TV stars and their neurotic producers, co-workers and assistants. It gets old. One crisis after another. One mental breakdown after another. One argument after another. Two characters cannot have a conversation without it evolving into an argument. The strange thing is in between the neurotic screaming matches and political corporate nonsense, there are some great scenes and dialog. I gave the show 6 stars. The first season I give it 8. The first half of season 2 is a 6 and the second half a 4. Averaged out, I give it a 6 overall. Billy Crudup is good as a network executive. I still haven't figured if he's as nice and wonderful as he claims he is or is he as sleazy as I suspect he really is. Jennifer Aniston plays a prima donna TV star. I think she overdoes it at times. I find it hard to believe TV shows behind the scenes are as disturbing and incestuous as this show is.It's a decent show but I think they overdid it with the neurosis and ditsy behavior by the characters on the show.So, 6 stars for a show that got worse than better over 2 seasons. Can they rebound for season 3? Let's hope so.",2
"Decent Season 1 if unremarkable. Terrible Season 2.","Star studded cast. Decent energy. Great environment. Interesting setup. S1 decent but unremarkable. Handles an important topic seriously but only competently. Rather than going deeper to find the dark, deeper and wider stories of the powerful in our society hidden in plain site, they put the brakes on. Season 2 had no idea where to go once the direction was walled off and the characters descended into unbelievable caricature. Shame as it had the ingredients to do something interesting.",8
"Thought provoking","Very thought provoking. The ""poor me, sad white men, being persecuted just for being men"" narrative is raging in this show, along with, ""Who else knew?"" Important conversations, but not fun ones to have. The more Women take power in this show, the more likely I am to continue watching it.",9
"Loved it but....","Really loved it. Steve Carell's perfromance is stellar. Aniston's character meltdowns epic!But: the Cast could use some fine tuning:
Aniston's husband obnoxious, her daughter unbearable with bad acting, totally unfitting ' family'
Also the side stories: are all boooooring. I mean:
Mia- ugh!! Nerve- wrecking boring character and acting
The Weatherman with a ton of make up also indifferent and boring
Junior booker's rise to the top story, simply pathetic.Last but not least, I feel that Aniston and Reese have no chemistry whatsoever. Not at all.",10
"Excellent Show🌞","Everything in the show is great/excellent; the timing is great, the topic is great, but the excellent^2 are the 2 women, up until episode 04 at least, I'll update this as we move on....",10
"Wonderful!","Great dialogue, intense controversies, fabulous actuation, thoughtful insights into human relationships and the effect of power on leaders and TV stars! It is deeper than it seems at first, since the plot does go into a great variety of emotions, critical situations, psicological dependencies, and very important, the fact that some characters really are not aware of their internal problems, until the crude reality tumbles them down. I liked it because it has brought a lot of interesting controversies afloat, things that were accepted suddenly changed, and people did not realize what had happened, until it was too late. A smart insight into TV life and interaction of power! Just finishing first season.",10
"Riveting TV!","I never write reviews but this show is amazing. The timing, acting, the lines, everything is on par. Billy Crudup makes this show.
Go watch, you will not be disappointed",10
"Congrats Apple. I mean.. I'm hooked!","Just spot on, SPOT ON, casting. The acting is amazing, the story is amazing. The chemistry between jennifer and reese is palpable and takes the show to another level. Steve Carrel's character is brilliant, making you feel unconfortable with his obliviousness regarding his behaviour every step of the way.
The show also vibrates a 'Big Little Lies' vibe, although very different, because the character development is as deep as it gets. Congrats Apple.",10
"Meh.","At best it is ok. Television would happily continue without The Morning Show ever existing. Maybe Reese Witherspoon is a genius, because I watched both seasons? Something or someone had to carry Jennifer Aniston. It was not the script, and I am not sure why Steve Carell was in the second season.I would not normally comment, but two million dollars an episode for doing a (spot on) Rachel from Friends impression? Good for you Jennifer, I suppose.",6
"Iconic Drama","It's a drama about working ethics in big companies and what companies do to keep women's silence for sex abuses from managers. UBA's scandals start appearing to surface after ""me too"" movement. The show will play with your motions in good ways every episode will increase your rage quite a bit will reach you to the optimum in last episode. Every actress and actor played his role amazingly amazing. I am surprised by Jenifer Aniston I know she is a good actress and has got a good talent but she used to play week roles but in this show, her real talent exploded glow on all acting levels she's rediscovered herself. Steve carrel one of the best comedians actors and they are few but he also proves he has a huge impact on drama talented talent.
Reese Witherspoon, she was like an energetic conscience. Billy Crudup acts like a real he was amazingly good very smart acting he deserves Oscar even there's no Oscar for a tv show. I want to write about all actors and actresses they were awesome all of them. Finally one of the things that will make this show as an iconic drama author and director they deserve many thanks",10
"Great show lacking consistency","The Morning Show is very well done and the acting is great. However, it's every other episode that's good and it can be frustrating. Aniston and Weatherspoon carry the show quite well.",7
"Too woke and fake","Horrible writing, just trying way too hard to pander to the woke twitter crowd who aren't even real people. Then they start on Covid a year too late and no one wants to hear about it anymore. Apple tv needs to get unwoke real quick before they lose it.",1
"Must Watch","This show is AMAZING. Everyone was cast so perfectly and it is a must watch.",10
"Worth watching","The series is slow in the beginning but it's definitely worth the watch for the later episodes and ending. The acting is great and I like seeing the internal conflict each character has.",8
"Whiterspoon. Aniston. Carrell. A magnificent cast.","I'm really happy with this show. I'm looking forward to see its second second because I love the first one. The writing and acting are SUPERB and the story is fantastic! Very involving.What I really enojoy about it is that we don't get only one part of the abuse, but we get the whole situation, by many points of views. This may be one the first TV shows -in history- that has ever talked about abuse in a television studio, that's very impresive. These are #MeToo times, and we have to rise to the occasion. Now, PLEASE: NOMINATE REESE WITHERESPOON TO AN EMMY PLEASE!! SHE DID A FANTASTIC JOB UNTIL NOW.I'm hoping season 2 to finally give a 10.",9
"Amazing","Incredible Show!! Must Watch! Jennifer Anniston's best role yet!",9
"From good to bloody great!","This started off good, then got better, then better still. The last episode especially gives this a 10 star rating. Loved it.",10
"What a show!","I thought I would hate seeing my favorite actor, Steve Carell, play a character I despise but I still loved it. I really liked Chip and I wish I could see him with a happy ending since he's pretty much the only decent character who wasn't trying to think only about himself and his career and what others' actions could better help him ascend further. He seemed pretty cool and the actor was great. Cory was so smooth and refreshingly humorous towards the truth and reality of life's situations. Every female character including the ones that annoyed me in the beginning (because some did) won over my utmost affection and empathy. Seriously, every single one. I wish there was more at the end that's my only complaint. Wow, what a show!!!",10
"It's a meh","I expected much more from Anniston but her acting didn't meet my expectations. The positive part is story which touches on a sensitive topic. This show is not everyone's cup of tea.",6
"Surprisingly glorious","Apple really splooged on this one. I dont think you can have a better cast and a better show for what it is. Must watch for sure",9
"A bit excited at first","Supporting cast was great. Otherwise, it all seemed forced and BS most times. I stopped at Season 1, episode 6.I wish Apple would just stop whatever they are doing. Just stop, Apple!",7
"Season 1 great, 2 good, 3 sucks","Season 3 is a waste of time. Overacting or no acting. Over drama playing the race card, corporate shenanigans and other nonsense. A back in time episode that was confusing and unnecessary. No idea what the point was right in the middle of the story. There is no point for the entire season. Maybe the writers strike weighed it down with lead and sunk it. What they need now is bring back Steve Carell as an entirely new character couldn't be any worse. Fighting zombies? Not sure how they will bring on a season four but for now I have to keep typing to meet the minimum to create something as boring...",4
"An incredibly excellent series","The Morning Show - Is an incredibly well done and super well done series, it's addictive, it's dramatic and it's creative and the series has an incredible good cast: Jennifer Aniston in the role: (d Alex Levy), Reese Witherspoon as ((Bradley Jackson), they are wonderful, they deploy all forms of expression that intensify each scene they pass, wow what an incredible performance of these wonderful actresses) but there is also other excellent actors like: Billy Crudup in the role of: (Cory Ellison), Steve Carell in the role of: (Mitch Kessler) and Mark Duplass in the role of: (Chip Black) of course the rest of the cast is as talented and it is also the great strength of this series (like others who knew how to integrate actors (trices) of value to give this famous more to the series) when you have a superb scenario, an impeccable realization with a photograph incredible and in addition to extraordinary actors (trices), you don't know what to do with the good, not the good with the excellent! There is humor at the beginning which slowly turns into dramatic scenes, (with this hot topic of sexual harassment), a series which we are impatiently waiting to discover the second season.",10
"Season 2 - so much more","I liked season 1 of The Morning Show. It was a solid story, well acted and put a deserved light on the #Metoo movement. Season 2 ups the ante considerably. Following the aftermath for the characters affected by season one. The already good acting from season one is sensational in season two with very much higher stakes. This show doesn't do black and white characters but shows us how we tend to model people that way and how badly that can go.",9
"Good good good so good!","Very good good good super good very good
Very good good good super good very good",10
"An Amazing Must Watch","I had seen the previews and decided to view the first episode. Afterwards, I binged watch through the entire season over the holidays. Can't wait for season 2. I can't recommend this show enough.",10
"Amazing!!!","Excellent series with excellent actors. Jennifer was amazing!!!",9
"Holy Cow.","Loved every minute of it. Amazing acting, and the story was fantastic and so relevant to today. I can't wait for the next season.",10
"The last couple of episodes are top TV","This series is okay until the last 2 episodes of Series 1, then it uses skilful writing, acting and production to build great tension, really well done.Lots of great acting but for me the biggest surprise and interesting characters are Steve Carells's Mitch and Billy Cruddup's Cory are standouts both take over the screen and play their roles to perfection.",7
"Congrats! Well Worth the Time!","I am not a person who regularly writes reviews but I had to write one for this show. Hats off to Kerry Ehrin, Jay Carson, Reese Witherspoon , Jennifer Aniston and all the rest of the producers of this amazing show. To me, this represents the potential of television: its ability to inspire change. As a new producer myself, I can appreciate the enormous amount of work it took to pull this off. The story is engaging with outstanding performances from a stellar all-star cast. I think the show finds its footing by episode 3. I encourage everyone to stick with it as you will find yourself slowly pulled in by the story. As a man who wants to see Hollywood become a much safer working environment, the subtext was not lost on me. The executive producers of the show, who are mostly female, touch on a subject that is rarely talked about: the successful women who knew these practices were going on but maybe did not speak up loudly enough against it. I think it masterfully represents the male perpetrators of this behavior and how, for some, they have convinced themselves that they are the true victims. They are truly blind to the devastation they have caused. It also shows the difficult position that HR is put in when trying to navigate workplace romances and sexual predation and being able to tell the difference. I am looking forward to seeing more of this show. I hope to make television with the same quality and standards as you have all accomplished with this project.",10
"Bloody Botox","If you can get past Jennifer Aniston's inert lip top lip then you will enjoy the show. It's frustrating that women in Hollywood have to use fillers and Botox to the point of being barely even able to emote. There are some scenes where you are not quite sure who's top lip is actually present when you're looking at Jennifer Aniston's face, but it sure as hell isn't hers because it's doing something else or nothing at all. She really such a beautiful woman ..... why? Why should she feel the need to do this to herself? It's really all you can see when she's talking. I wish they would ban Botox, injectables and fillers entirely. This that we can see, women represented properly in their natural state.",7
"Please end this dreadful series.... season Two has turned this Soap Opera into a true Disaster Series","This series manages to waste the talent of just about every performer and it's cast. Jennifer Anistons character is unlikable, Reece Witherspoon is unlikable, the whole cast is unlikable... And this is Wrong because in most venues they have delivered wonderful related performances.The producers and writers of the series have created a turgid soap opera drama that moves along a predictable path of destruction for this morning network show. . The characters are shallow with little depth or development, often pathetic in their performances and Aniston at the helm sinks this leaky vessel.Is it the producers fault... the directors fault or the actors not being able to deliver a performance from a sophomoric script? Who knows? Who cares?Spoiler.. Steve Carrell has been possibly killed off of this turkey in time for Thanksgiving. He has much to be thankful for this year.",2
"Top Drawer entertainment","I came to this on the back of a free Apple subscription. I was not going to bother but then I started watching one night when I could not sleep.No need to go through the story, it's bang on up to date but does not patronise. The production values are stunning. The performances are full on epic. It looks fantastic. It is a drama and watches like a modern day Shakespeare play, every character is so well rounded. I Cannot wait for the next ten episodes. Netflix watch out.",9
"Binge worthy!","Wow. No words. If the actors and content don't pull you in then the music and cinematography will. Can't wait to see the next season!If you like this, also watch The Newsroom.",10
"Great Cast","Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell were the hook to get me watching. Billy Crudup's character is captivating, annoying - it's excellent. The acting in the series is authentic. The dark veil on the storyline makes you wary. You don't want to jump to conclusions.",9
"Yes!","It took me a few eps to get into it, but this show got better and better. Hope there will be another season because Alex and Bradley just got to an interesting dynamic and we need some justice for Chip!This show reminded me a lot of The Newsroom, but with more intense and raw drama.",8
"great series","As I remember from'' Friends'', Rachel had a relationship with her assistant Tag and it was so normal those days. Times change. Apart from that great drama series, I watched every second of it twice already.",10
"Takes a bit to get going","You've probably seen by now that this show takes a few episodes to really find its footing. By episode 3, I was hooked. This show does touch on a lot of current issues and I have a feeling some of the initial backlash is in part due to the controversial subjects portrayed in this show. I urge you to give it a chance!",10
"It's NBC","Am I the only one who thought this was all about matt lauer and sweet sweet Katie couric?",7
"Brilliant","I can't stop thinking about this show. The characters are largely unlikable and yet I love them. Even the really bad guys are somehow still human. They deal with the MeToo movement in a way that isn't preachy or over the top and they get to the meat of the issues. Fantastic television.",10
"Up to Ep. 7; getting a tad melodramatic","The daughter character , quintessential Show Biz Kid.
Getting hokier and hokier",6
"What a lode of woke","I couldn't stand another second of it!Season one was tolerable but then came season 2. It's bad enough we have to live all this stuff. Now our entertainment makes us relive it.",2
"Brilliantly Written","Here is a show of our time that ruthlessly mines the me too debate with a really tight and provocative script. The cast really get their teeth into fantastic roles (can Rees Witherspoon have a better run than Little Fires Everywhere + Big Little Lies and this), Jennifer Anniston reminds us what a talent she is and the rest of the cast are brilliant. I lived it so much I watched it twice.",9
"Awesome Show","Incredible depiction of what Morning News actually is, entertainment for the Brain Dead Masses.Except for Micheal Strahan, that guy is awesome.",10
"Very heartfelt and thoughtful provoking","I just finished watching and I'm so sad and emotional. This is a must watch for everyone. I'm questioning certain things I did in my not so distant part. This show is very deep on several levels, and I really want to see a continuation asap.",9
"Really well acted, enjoyable, riveting and moreish!!","Loved the first season despite the subject matter normally having no interest for me! I was drawn in by the 3rd episode and just had to keep watching! Great job to everyone from Director/producer and script writers to a great cast! Billy and Bel were the icing on the cake for me!",8
"I hate it but I keep watching anyway....","I am not a fan of any of the actors in the slightest - all one dimensional, can barely generate an emotional moment, but I keep watching the show.WHY WHY WHY ? its almost like a traffic accident in slow motion. YES your characters are all AHOLES, yes you live in a city and work in a business were AHoles do well. However, the mainstream media thing has been done before and in a far better format - but I think its the underlying #metoo #weinstein #harassment #assault track that is keeping me interested. Could be the pretty faces too....There is no redeeming end to this series, just more and more of the same, just with different characters as each burns out or gets fired.At first I thought Witherspoon's character had something tangible, but that has faded in to nothingness. Unless this show falls in to an alternate universe track, it could plod on like so many others....",9
"Newsroom fans, you'll love this!!","Although it would have been a whole other genre had Sorkin been involved, but the premise being similar does bring back a lot of good memories.And no, I'm not comparing the two in this review; Newsroom holding you on your toes with the news stories and all, but man oh man is it awesome to watch A-listers KILLING it up in here. Every single cast member is just mind blowing!My personal ""Whaaa??!?"" performance, I'll have to say, is coming from Billy Crudup. I haven't yet found a single scene where he hasn't been less than perfect.I did knock off one star, for now, due to the slight exageration toward the whole feminism, powerful women promoting agenda. And don't get me wrong, I do respect and support the idea of gendre equality, I just feel like, well, how about we keep it equal... Oh, and of course, because Aaron Sorkin wasn't involved.",7
"Season 3 is a top notch","Here's my 9 for season 3.It's the best season so far imo.Surprisingly, there are two characters whose arches I want to follow and whose growth is undeniable: Cory and Stella's. Stella is my personal favorite. Alex and Bradley are ok, but it seems like they are too much into their personal matters both are becoming a bit 2-dimensional, whereas both Stella and Cory are in 3D: we are finding out about their personal struggles and see how it affects their paths in UBA. Greta Lee's performance is outstanding.And as the side note: seeing Jon Hamm made me wanna watch Mad Men again. He's a great addition to The Morning show cast.",10
"ADDICTING","It takes AMAZING writing to make you hate Steve Carroll, Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are amazing. You will only be able to watch this show in 3-4 hour intervals. You've been warned",6
"The Last Episode (Finale) Killed it for me. CLICHED TWIST!","Okay, So I haven't written a review like this ever in my entire life, even though I have had strong opinions. But when it's something as sensitive as this, then there is a lot of room to think about, or let's say rant about.I loved the first couple of episodes until the part Hannah dies! I won't deny, every character was so strongly portrayed in the grey light and I even loved how we were given both sides of the world view, the wrong and the one who's been wronged, and the show --it was built in this environment where we were left to think for ourselves and judge every character strongly, and they built it in such a way that Mitch was going to come and give the interview and nail Fed's  to the wall. But then, that would be too straight forward and predictable right? so the writers decided to give a twist and sweep in something known and cliche as Pity by killing Hannah. I mean, what the hell was that? I am supposed to feel bad, yeah sure i feel bad, I am mourning for the character. But is it good for the message that you were trying to portray all along? NO!The show was doing so well showing how women were struggling & fighting to keep up in such an environment and each of them finding their own voice, and let me clarify that the show did take on a almost realistic feel, so when the last episode suddenly turns into a cliche soapy dramatic turn then don't blame me for hating it because it shows everyone has got only one answer ,i.e, the victim has to die for things to turn around. But is that the message you are trying to put out there? Is that empowering for women victims around the world who are trying to find their voice. Hey, maybe you should die and then your seniors are gonna blink and be like oh my god we were so wrong. WRONG! Because that's not how the world works. How about for a change, victimised women should stop being killed just for the heck of a dramatic turn. And this show wasn't just about men being predators, it had a lot to do with women not being right themselves, so why suddenly take on a black and white twist in the end. Why? You clearly did state that women are not so innocent themselves.So why not keep Hannah alive and, I know that would have been a difficult twist without making it seem all about Mitch and Fred in the end, but then in the end it turns about THEM ONLY! And Alex suddenly changing in the end? THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE not even for Alex's character. People in that position don't suddenly wake and think oh let me jeopardise myself today. It was like the writers wrote the first couple of episodes beautifully but finding themselves stuck and oh hopefully a new season they drag this sort of ending into it. That's what writers room are for. Brainstorm and maybe talk to an actual victim survivor or millions and see how they made or making it and then maybe find a way to put that on screen in a dramatic way rather than finding the EASY WAY out and killing the girl, because what? You think that's really going to wake people up. That's insulting to women who face this everyday in their work lives!And lastly, I am not saying that there aren't lives of women lost over grave matters as this. I acknowledge that and so does the world. We all know how its affected women and the lives that we have lost over the years. But is that how we are willing to carry it forward? always show a victimised woman dying to things to change? Why not for a change show that victimised woman having some chance in life, even if she is not ready to take it. A chance where it would force her to turn things for herself. A chance how you think they could stand for themselves. Why not talk about those who are alive and still suffering!Anyhow, guessing how they are coming up with a second season, hopefully they incorporate something such as this into it, and stick to realism since that's how they started it with! Maybe I wouldn't have judged it too hard if the treatment was done differently.I am giving this a 6/10 only because the first couple of episodes did a good job.",4
"Strong first season. Disappointing second season.","Whoever wrote Season 2 needs to be taken off this show asap! The amount of woke nonsense churned out in each episode was enough to turn me off after Ep3. My partner and I are over this show, which is a shame as the 1st season was so enjoyable. Season 1 was a solid 8/10. Season 2 was a 3/10; I'm giving it three as I like the set design, Chip and views of Lake Como.",10
"Jennifer Anniston is really acting and I love it","Actresses are much more interesting to watch when they let you see into them Jennifer Anniston is empowered when she is acting her age and It's awesome to watch- go girl - great topic great cast but Anniston did it foR me and I was never a huge fan-",10
"Reinvention of Jennifer Aniston","The show is brilliant and, frankly, I was astonished by Jennifer Aniston's performance! In recent years she's turned up in a bunch of comedies and now we can finally enjoy watching her doing some real drama! The cast is fantastic, the plot is the one that grips you immediately and the score is beautiful and slightly disquieting - in a good way!",10
"HFS!!!","This show is INTENSE! Everything in this program works, the acting, the writing, everything is done right. Definitely give this one a chance I think you'll like it.",8
"Great Show","I thought that when watching this show I wouldn't have the most expectations but boy was I wrong. I truly loved watching this show and thought it was super enjoyable throughout and I really hope that season 3 can blow my expectations away because I love this show from the start to the finish and love everyone in it and think the casting choices were just perfect for the show. I think this is a show that everyone needs to watch to see how enjoyable it is. I really love the plot of the show too and all the drama throughout. It makes this such a compelling show to watch and to enjoy throughout. Overall just a good show.",9
"Definitely a binge worthy show!","This storyline is so emotional and rings true with the times of silence during harassment. It not only shows what it did to the women, but also the men including the perpetrator. I read many reviews that said season one was awesome but 2 was not. I disagree. This show has been captivating from episode 1. It deals with so much emotion and how different individuals deal with the same tragedy. The cast is fantastic and I can't wait for season 3! I found myself rooting for certain cast and then disliking them the next show and then back to caring about them the next episode. The writing was phenomenal as well as top notch cast. I definitely recommend this! Worth paying for the streaming service just for this show.",9
"Language ???","S1 - well acted, great camera work, pacing . . .but , my wife and I can't but notice, why oh why does every character have to use the ' F ' word -- every 2nd or 3rd sentence ? I 've worked on shows like this . . . .
People do not swear all day long . Is this the writers idea ?A lazy, tiresome ploy. Let' s cut back on this . It waters down the dialog. I doubt Billy Crudup, or Reese , or Jennifer Anniston talk like this as a matter of course . You can have a biting drama without the poor language all the way through . Occasional is fine, but not to this extent. Plus , it lumps all the characters into one mindset .",6
"Great show","I really liked season 1 but disagree with the negative reviews for season 2. Season 2 was very good. Everyone does a great job but I really like Billy Crudup and Steve Carrell. Really good writing and I loved how they handled the Beginnings of the Pandemic.",9
"I can't get beyond ep. 2","Reese Witherspoon can act, Jennifer Aniston not so much! For me she nailed Rachel full stop! As for the show, bad writing makes it a 7 at best! Politics aside, it's the 2019 story and needs to be put On to our screens in some fashion! The potential is there but the execution falls short",7
"I enjoyed hate watching this barely watchable soap opera","I did not know hate watching was a thing. But what I loved about the show was how much I hated these superficial, back stabbing, phony, pretentious, hypocrites. Anyway, when I described how I was watching the show to my husband, he explained that hate watching is what people do when watching a sports event, movie or series in order to mock the events on the screen. ""The Morning Show"" provides lots of opportunity with a seemingly infinite supply of one creepy, contemptible, untrustworthy character after another in one cringe worthy scene after another.I know that Paul Marks was supposed to be a play on Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his dubious take over of Twitter. Musk really destroyed Twitter but that was not a main stream news outfit. The only character I really liked was Paul Marks, and this is in no small part due to the incredible performance by Jon Hamm, who by the way, is not to be missed in Season 2 of ""Good Omens."" The idea that Alex Levy, who is just a high paid talking (air) head, and did not do one minute of journalism during the entirety of Season 3, would try to preserve UBA through a merger with another failing corporate media giant, rather than have a leading role in the creation of a new company while being in a relationship with a billionaire, stretched credibility. At the end of the day, it was a hilarious farce.Are we supposed to feel sorry for a huge MSM (Main Stream Media) conglomerate, who has never met a war they did not love, or played a role in stirring up the public against some foreign (but imaginary) enemy, as if people are not the same the world over and there are not bad people (with a few good people) everywhere. Profits are what drives corporate news. If you want real journalism, you need to find an independent media outlet, not the original of which UBA was based on. As if these journalists, whose salaries could feed and house an entire town of poor people for a year really care about the truth or about the lives of their viewers.If you want to indulge in a little hate watching schadenfreude, this one is for you. If not, your life will be no poorer for having skipped it.",3
"The Gift That Keeps On Giving","I'm always two-minded when it comes to a new series; lets face it, it is committing to it in order to finish it.The Morning Show does not disappoint! Keeps you wanting more after every episode. The way the writers and producers write in reality and daily Social Issues/ Stigmas, is so refreshing and not all up in your face.I think it takes pure art to write and produce content that, in reality, are stones in our shoes and what Society ""covers up"", especially in BIG Cooperations.What a cast?! The combination of Reese, Jennifer and Steve is just incredible, but to mention the rest of the cast. It is just beautiful choir!Very excited for what's to come for this series!",9
"Gripping","I don't really understand some of the negative ""critic"" reviews - overly-psychoanalytical and sounded like they were trying to hard to pigeonhole the drama. The Morning Show is simply better than good TV. The acting is phenomenal; Carrell, Aniston, Crudup, Witherspoon all deeply flawed, human and beautifully layered. The writing is fresh and witty; although at times you find yourself wanting to remind the writers that while the virtues of the F word are many, there are over another 1M words in the English language to choose from. By the end of the season I caught myself holding my breath with the intensity, clapping and even shed a half a tear... maybe two. Can't wait for season 2, I just hope the suits behind Apple's new lineup don't put too much stock in the handful of negative critic reviews.",10
"Loved it","I don't usually get hooked on tv shows that are straight drama. I tend to lose interest in it after even several episodes. This show was NOT the case. They handle very complex, tough-to
-confront topics so despite it being a drama, I was constantly interested in what was going on. There was incredible character complexity and development that made me simultaneously hate and love all of them. I was impressed with the acting and l felt the pain people were experiencing. It can be very heavy and I sometimes needed a break from it lol! I so so so recommend this show!",10
"It's amazing show","There is things are very important on that show very nice and genuine.",10
"Estelar","One of the best television shows I've ever seen. Worth every cent the $4.99 I paid to sign it to Apple TV+ and watch this show. Incredible script, incredible acting, incredible and very current storyline. A must watch!",10
"The best of the best","From episode 1 to the last one of this season, you can always see the dramatic scenes in this drama. See the changes and insides of every person, you will really fall into the story, deeply, especially the last episode.",10
"Season 1 was good and then it tanked!","This is definitely high budget with very nice cast, so you can expcet the acting to be good.Season one is ok and I would give it 7/10. It is a bit slow but it takes its time to build the characters. The story is decent and overall engaging.If we leave it at S1 and end there, I can say that it is an enjoyable show that is not necessarily a must watch but there are worse onces out there.Season two comes and it destroys everying from S1. They introduce Covid, gays and lesbans, racism with the sad columbian and black news guy. Michael Scott dies (Steve Carell) and it just in the background, they couldn't even kill him properly...",6
"Surreal, fun , addictive , sad , dark & sweet !","One of the best tv series I have seen in a long time. Very complex and well made and most importantly all the actors are putting in an amazing performance",10
"A great cast for a well written and produced series and then season 2 failed","I was rather on ricky Gervais' appraisal over the news that Apple was launching its own production company. Furthermore I was awaiting something that would please the public taste for self-righteousness as big business love to purchase a positive image through media activity.Yet I must admit after having watch all 10 episodes that this series firts season it was actually quite smart and really tries to find a good balance in order to portrait human nature as being a complex mesh of opposing feelings and desires.Surely the show is not as fast-paced and over-witty as Network. However it didn't try to divide humankind between the inherently flawed/bad and the staunchly moral/good people a story trap in which I felt Network fell into often.In this series first season all characters were acting at the same time on impulses and on strategy. Sometimes the two different stimuli for action panned out well however most often it generated chaos, incomprehension and unneeded suffering.The way that this show treated the issue of male predators and female desire was well observed and you couldn't really catch how well it's treated until you completed the screening of the full series. It's a complex alchemy where basically the lack of realization of behaviors triggered by impulses by one engendered by impacted negatively others to breaking point..On the downside, I was expecting something a tad funnier as I really thought it was a comedy. It has its moments but overall I wouldn't say that this show is within the range of comedy. It's rather more a lighthearted drama.On the plus side, I found that Billy Crudup is absolutely great in his role. Jennifer Anniston is not making to many faces as she sometimes does and as a result is highly credible in her role. And Reese Witherspoon does more than a good job. Not to mention all the rest of the cast that I found also very good. Direction is up to par, there are few moments if any that I found lengthy and boring. As far as the writing is concerned, its solid without being fantastic. Some of the scenes and dialogues are just leading nowhere probably due to the fact that the show was written mostly during its filming.Now season 2 is a big miss. It failed on many points. Characters became uninteresting, running to and fro on red herrings chases. They appear all to be constantly on the verge of nervous breakdown. It tries to get into some other topics that are shaking the US society such as race relation however, obviously whether due to time constraint or the need to focus on preexisting characters embodied by stars, it wasn't carried forward. Even the corporate world depiction became cliché and stale. Such a disappointment...",6
"If you're desperate for a show....","Aniston is one of the most overrated actors. I watch this show and I just see her ""acting"". Her character is not believable, I don't believe her anger, and her anchor scenes are so forced. Same with Witherspoon. I watch her and think she's acting like some angry, small town, rough breaks person. Not believable at all.",1
"Very well written show","Everyone talks about the stellar cast and I agree but the real heroes are the story writers. What superb storyline, brilliant dialogues and excellent characters.",9
"The show is very well done","I can't understand why some of the initial reviews of the show were poor. The writing is very good, character development is outstanding. Television is absurd and that's the context in which we are seeing these characters develop. I'm really looking forward to the rest of the season.",10
"Amazing","Great first show by Apple have to say set and got stuck in and watch all 3 episodes one after the outer can't wait for the next episode",10
"Must-watch!","The acting is absolutely top notch! This story was never told before. The direction is amazing.
This show is only suffering because Apple TV+ is new. You gotta give this an opportunity!",9
"Yes.","This is great writing. Anyone who doesn't rate this at an 8 or above either doesn't know great writing when they see it, or they have ulterior motives.",10
"Total excellence from Crudup and Aniston","Fantastic show in many ways - great script and interesting topics that are executed successfully throughout the season.
Some scenes are a little loooong and Reese Witherspoon is as always a little annoying - but you actually dont care about that when the rest is so good.
Billy Crudup and Jennifer Aniston probably does the best acting so far in their careers.",6
"A boring story with less than medicore performances.","Whole show is just meh.Not much chemistry between characters.Over the top dialogue delivery with very little emotions in between.I wish they could improve the story then maybe it would've worked.Disappointed just watching first season. Can't bother to watch the follow up.",9
"Brilliant!","In my opinion, this show is absolutely brilliant! The chemistry between Jennifer Anniston and Reese Witherspoon is electric.",7
"MeToo MeHorrible","Acting is great. Production values superb.Story? Not credible. An anchor who demands the right to pick the new co-anchor, is told no, and then does it anyway? She isn't then fired? Goes on to say she has the power when she doesn't?The man accused of sexual impropriety claims that men use power to seduce women. That's backwards. Women are attracted to power. Always have been and always will be. No woman in the history of mankind has ever been attracted to weak men.The portrayal of relationships between men and women is something straight out of a far leftist women's studies program. If you want to see how far left Hollywood has gone, so far that they aren't aware of how unrealistic this is, watch The Morning Show.",2
"Tired of Covid and politics","Guess they didn't have anything else to write about instead of Covid....again and again. Probably won't continue to watch this show. Don't like the agenda. It's so obvious it slaps you in the face. I guess they think everyone is ignorant like them. Way too political and too full of ridiculous stereotypes, always against the Right. Tired of this in every show...why don't you use your imaginations and write new material. Boring. Too bad because I enjoyed the other seasons. Disappointed in the obvious prejudices against people and their hysteria. Running out of the house because your boyfriend went to a bar? Please. I worked with the public all through Covid and couldn't hide in my house. Grow up.",9
"Superb!!","Excellent on every front, beautifully written, engaging.. the acting is just extraordinary! I loved it!",10
"Apple commercial badly done","I can't stand that, where in everything is bad: sound, script, actors (except phenomenal Jen Aniston)... It's just very long Apple commercial-iphones and macs in every scene. Boring... I'm absolutely disappointed with that ""something"".",9
"Nail biting extremely well acted Drama","This show is brilliant. Movie or TV I haven't watched anything this good in a long time.Laugh out loud in places, brilliantly acted drama that is genuinely nail biting and tense at times and characters I can really get on board with.The final episode had me standing up with excitement and tension.Well bloody done!",10
"Jennifer steals the show","An amazing performance of J. Aniston. She deserves to be in more drama movies and the oscar can be just around the corner.",10
"A really interesting series","I was skeptical before starting it because of the critics reviews, but after watching the first episode, I was immediately hooked to it. And every episode's ending is so good that you immediately want to start the next one. I am waiting for next episode to get released!",8
"What a finale!","I was initially distressed that the show was trying to rewrite The Newsroom, but in the end I'm really glad I gave the show a chance. The season just built and built, ending on a powerful, emotional, rollercoaster. What a great cast and what great writing. I'll be waiting eagerly for the next season!",10
"First season was great then the changed direction","I could not praise the first season of this show more highly. Engaging, well acted, written and produced. I couldn't wait for season two.Three episodes into this season and the show is getting close to unwatchable. The show has gone from politically neutral to far left. It seems that each episode in season two has to highlight some far left wing agenda item. So unfortunate.",7
"Incredible!!!","I cannot stress how INCREDIBLY GOOD this show is.. Jennifer Aniston & Reece Witherspoon are absolutely amazing as are all the cast but these two stand out for me.
The story is gripping, every episode is punchy and real. I just wish they would release all 11 episodes so i can binge watch it, its nice looking forward to the next episode though.
Well done to all involved, you've done an amazing job! Superb *****",10
"Good but not great","I was really looking forward to this show. I like both actresses and was interested what they can bring to the table together. The show started off well but after the 7th episode it got a bit off track. It seemed like the director, the producers wanted to cover too many issues at a time. Also, it became inconsistent on many levels... people are changing their minds a lot and the reasoning behind is not convincing enough. E.g Why does Clare tell Hannah that the only person who understands her is her boyfriend, Yanko (who works at the same production company) and then dump the guy the same day because she does not want to be defined by her relationship to him? It just doesn't make sense. Is this how you behave with the guy who totally gets you while no one else does? There are other instances where the characters say one thing and then act differently or they go on changing their minds way too much. It makes the viewer uneasy and the characters lose credibility.
To me the Hannah story was a bit forced. Many times it is emphasized how bad/traumatizing the experience must have been for the women who suffered from abuse in the show but to me it seemed like they always had a choice. They could have said no and walk away.
The show does raise awareness to sexual misconduct as well as to the so-called ""silencing culture"". It is definitely food for thought.
I also liked the superb acting of Billy Crudup, Aniston, Mark Duplass and the rest of the cast.
Overall I would give a 6 out of 10.",6
"Maybe ok for Americans who watch these morning shows","I couldn't, I wanted to but I couldn't. I had to stop part way thru the first episode because meh. And I like the actors. It just doesn't grab me. But I guess lots of others like it, and that's ok too.",2
"So well done minus 1","This show is so close to perfection! The writing and acting are just the best I've seen in awhile. The show as a whole is so well done aside from ""Bradley Jackson"" . I feel Bradley Jackson wasn't well written, cast, or even had a decent name! If you plucked her out of the show it would be perfect! And what's crazy is Reese Witherspoon did an amazing job in this show. Jennifer Aniston out acted everyone!",9
"Comfortable Discomfort","This is one of those shows that you can adore while you are totally uncomfortable with the people on the screen. Jennifer Aniston is at the top of her game and clearly doesn't care if we are her Friends anymore. It's a magnificent portrait of a woman who.is trying to stay on top while the mountain is crumbling beneath her. She and Witherspoon are both giving such honest, truthful and dangerous performances that it's hard to look away.
The cast is splendid from the top down. Billy Crudup is eye-opening in this role, a character as unlikable as his attorney from ""Spotlight"" but whose soul might not be available to the highest bidder.
This is one of the shows I'm not binging. I'm watching one or two episodes at a time to savor it and think over what I've experienced. Because, you don't watch this show, you experience it.Spoiler alert: I knew Crudup could sing, but his duet partner was quite a surprise!",10
"Loved it","It's very well written, it has politics in the workplace , drama, suspense everything, I loved it",10
"Good old, beloved actors!","I just love the iPhone's strong pro acting. It gets the most scenes with the most drama!The iMac never gets old it seems. It still looks as young and fresh as 10 years ago.Always there when you expect it: The iPad.The smallest actor in the cast: The Apple Watch - Didn't say much yet tho, we want to see more!!I still wait for the HomePod, but I'm only in at minute 9 of episode 1 tho.",10
"Poignant and necessary","Great, ballsy way to start a series!
Creators, and cast are excellent.
Many angles and voices represented.
Hard, relevant topics addressed head on!
Great writing. Great characters.
No fluff here!",10
"A must see","Amazing cast. I am so happy to see Jennifer Aniston in a series again. She and Reese do a great job in this show. I'm not sure if I would follow the show if it weren't for the cast but I'm glad I did.",10
"feels like when you have to sneeze but never do.","Acting, direction, and pace are excellent.story is important and is relevant to a lot of the dialogue we are having in our real world and lives right now.despite that, it doesn't feel like the show ever came to any sort of conclusion or stance. the messages depicted didn't feel fleshed out, as if they were just put out there but not really discussed. just like when you have to sneeze but you never get there.still worth a watch.",6
"Amazing","It's not just AppleTV's best show....It's not just one of the best shows of the year....It's one of the best shows of all time. The writing is superb and Aniston and Crudup have never been better. They both deserve Emmys. I've never seen a show navigate such a delicate subject so well with such passion and brilliance. The payoff, the final episode, makes it even better. Its simply amazing.",10
"Waste of talent and money for a bad story","The direction and acting crew are doing their job fine, but the story has a lot of room for improvement. I just hope that the writers develop characters more profoundly and let the series end on a higher note.
Also, creating a series/film about #metoo movement is so cliche nowadays. The world has much more problems to tackle and show different aspects of.",6
"Glad I gave it a chance","To begin with, I never liked Jennifer Aniston as an actor or celeb. I'm meh with Steve Carell's self-conscious comedic style. I'm just lukewarm okay with Witherspoon.But the writing and directing soon melted my wall of skepticism. This is probably the best role ever written for Witherspoon. Then even Carell started to gel with this character. Then EVEN Aniston showed acting chop and courage!The casting is on point. Memorable performance by Mark Duplass, Billy Crudup and Karen Pittman.The tone is stern but not preachy, humorous but not glib, an amazing achievement in itself given the super challenging backdrop and sexual harassment subject matter. Those who like the Good Wife/ Good Fight will really like this.Looking forward the next season.",10
"Brilliant storyline that just got better ...","Started watching this a few weeks ago and as it went on the storyline became better and better. Great acting and a such a very true to life storyline, that had me gripped at the end. Fabulous show!",9
"Exceptional and Raw","I can't begin to explain how much of a breath of fresh air this show is. It begins dramatic, it indicates at certain points that it will go down the road that reality does - the male power will win. And then.....that breath!
You will feel everything they want you to feel, that you have felt either reading a similar story in the news, or experiencing it yourself. The acting is exceptional, you believe the characters, you don't think that you're watching Rachel from friends - you are watching Alex!
And Hannah - the character Hannah - central to the whole story and my god - wow! How honestly portrayed!
This show is what we needed!",10
"Great show","Brilliant cast, interesting subject matter, and a Steve Carrell that is finally not type-casted in yet another ""funny"" role. Definitely worthy watching and a good start for Apple TV+, IMO.",9
"Top Notch TV Drama","I held off watching this series because I remember the early critical reception being lukewarm. I finally decided to check it out. After watching the first few episodes, all I could think was, ""This reminds me of The Newsroom."" That HBO show ran from 2012-2014. With Aaron Sorkin at the helm, it tackled big issues with big complicated scripts.
Fast forward several years, and The Morning Show has a similar vibe. The whole ""look behind the veil"" aspect and tension closely mirror that HBO show. However, this is an all-new animal aimed at the #MeToo movement.
There is much to praise about the show. The cast is superb. As others have stated, Billy Crudup steals every scene. All the characters are complex, well-drawn, and well acted. The writing is truly top-notch, as is the set design, music, and cinematography. Basically, everything behind and in front of the camera is spot on.
What I admire most about the show is how it weaves all sides of the discussion into the complexities and politics of a major news organization. It's not some screaming liberal good versus evil story. Steve Carell's character in particular shines in his view of himself. Layer after layer gets exposed as each episode airs.
I ended up binge-watching the first season this week and can't wait for season two. I highly recommend this show.",10
"What an amazing show...","Well, it has just ended today, and despite the fact it started slowly, the end-game was breathtaking. They really got the point that, how terrible is a world, what is packed with terrible people, and ruled by guilty, shame and unspoken words hidden behind the shine.At the beginning I was thinking, that it is just another common and powerless ""me-too"", but it was brave and really went deep, not showing the world just from one perspective but we could understand more/different aspects of it, and wondering how, and how many ways soul a can rotten be. I'm stunned, because they could really show what they wanted to show us.From technical side it is a very strong start from Apple, spending on making great content, which makes to think even for a moment. It was an amazing comeback from Jennifer Aniston, but the play of Billy Crudup was exceptional, how he formed Cory's role in this show. Really looking forward season two!",10
"Interesting but not flawless","As always, the opinions of the people are divided into lovers and haters and that´s ok. In my case, as long as I´m hooked to watch episode after episode until the end - it is a good show for me. However, there are things I didn´t like. I understand that people are afraid to lose their jobs, but it´s still not realistic that a woman theese days has no other choice, but to sleep with someone to improve her career. I think it is an insult to all women in general. I agree with Mitch when he says that these ladies never said no, or did anything to stop him. Hannah could just say no to him and leave the room. Maybe she would lose her job, but she could at least live with herself. On top of that she accepts the promotion!?!?! I think the ""man power"" belongs to the past. I´m sure that in the 50´s or so was all very different, but the laws nowadays protect both women and men in such cases. The women in this show are presented as very weak, easy and I must say stupid. I´m a woman myself and I worked with a lot of men in my life and I think it´s just embarrassing what message about women this show sends. If you´re afraid to lose your job and then you do something you don´t want to do, then please learn to live with it and do not make a victim of yourself. The same goes to Mia character - she could also choose NOT to have an affair with Mitch for an entire year... Other than that it´s not a bad show, it shows us how the things work in business these days, and that in most corporations the people are just numbers...",7
"I said I wouldn't start another show","But I am so glad I did. This show is so well written. Interesting to see different perspectives about the me too movement. Jennifer aniston is particularly great, she is killing it. Very much looking forward to the rest of this season.",10
"Good story line - obsessively vile language","The story line is great. The acting is great. Both of these things would still be true without 500 f-bombs every single episode. Hard to follow the dialog with the Wolf of Wall Street profanity.",6
"Annoying.","The first season is very good, but it becomes so over the top and jumps the shark. Bradley jackson is so annoying she completely ruins the second season it was hard to finish. It becomes a whoa is me story from her character, hard to stomach her bad acting and even worse redundant character.",1
"Great show, excellent casting","I've been really enjoying this show. Strong writing and exciting performances from the actors.",10
"No what I expected!","I'm honestly enjoying the show so far.Yes it is political in many ways but why not?The cinematography is really nice (feels very real and clean)The acting is nice. You can tell that the actors are doing their best. Now i kinda blame the director for not fully directing them because you can still tell that jennifer and reese and steve are acting... Well but still acting.I definitely recommend it.",9
"Compelling + Thoughtful","This show is actually really good. Give it a chance and watch it. Don't listen to the haters. There are some really good twists in it and the acting is up there. I honestly think the people that said they watched it for 15 minutes and turned it off are lying.",10
"Possibly Jennifer Aniston's best role by far","The story lines are very interesting. You get to see one of this decades most important real world stories from both sides.This show also comes with many great actors who have excellent chemistry with each other.The most notable, in my opinion is Jennifer Aniston. I have only seen her in comedies and romantic movies. She was a good actor then. But this is something else. You get to experience her full artistic pallet. She is such a good actor in this show.",10
"Restore my hope for humanity","I am so happy the courage and insight required to make a show like this is alive and happening! From the incredible script writing to the sensational acting by all this show hits all the points. The confusion, the hurt, the responsibility and irresponsibility that manifest in the complex issue of sexual harassment and abuse. It is a multifaceted issue and we can all experience the complexities through these characters.Extra bravo the Jennifer Aniston who distinguishes herself as a excellent actor in this character. Reese Witherspoon is pretty spectacular as well but we kinda knew that already.",10
"TV+ Starts with a banger!","Yes, she does look old, but her charm is everlasting. The way she personates the character, that's the reason America loves you Jeniffer Aniston (no wait, the whole world does). Talking about the show, it picks up #MeToo and tries to show both perspectives and does fulfil that to quite an extent. The casting is topnotch with sprinkles of laughter now and then (especially Cory and Bradley), anyone who just got TV+ start with this show, must watch.P.S: All you aspiring journalists, this should be on top of your binge list.",9
"High Drama","I've worked on one of those network shows where none of the happy talk on the screen matched the drama and backstabbing backstage. The improbable plot devices of The Morning Show are exaggerated for dramatic purposes, perhaps with one exception, which is the boys club atmosphere. Powerful personalities and producers routinely exploited young staffers. Everybody knew about it. They got away with it because they were the franchise; they were the cash cows.The Morning Show is a thinly veiled take on the #MeToo morning show fallout. It goes over the top from there, especially Steve Carrell's unrepentant/clueless Mitch - you want to like him and hate him at the same time. Jennifer Anniston surprised me at how strong, yet vulnerable she was. Billy Crudup was appropriately slimy and scheming as the ambitious network executive. Reese Witherspoon may have been the weakest character only because her character never got fully fleshed out; she didn't quite know why she was there, and we didn't either. The ending of the final episode, of course, could never have happened on real air, but it was fun to watch.",7
"Well made serie, totally recommended!","First three episodes have been a blissing. Well filmed, great performance and overal very high quality tv serie, totally recommended!",10
"Good, but loses stars because...","Good story with interesting characters, but every discussion in this series escalates into a shouting match or worse. Does not seem like behavior of people who have succeeded in national television news. The intrigues are unusually complicated and risky, more like something in a spy thriller.
Gave it six stars. If things were toned down, I would have given eight.",6
"Zero Likeability","Everyone is mad, ego hurt, and likes giving speeches. You will not root for anyone. Sigh, gasp, I-I-. Everyone points the finger. Try listening to the show like it's an audio book and you'll want to change the channel.",2
"Awesome but stop after S2","S1 10/10. S2 pretty good. S3 terrible. I'm not even going to finish S3, you lost me at episode 6.The first season is unbelievable tv. Highly recommend to everyone. It'll have you thinking about metoo and other topical issues. It really gets you thinking and feeling sorry for people who you'd have thought you would never have compassion for.The acting is first class. Great job Apple TV. Shame you didn't call it a day after S2. Season 3 is all over the place and isn't easy to follow. The lockdown episode comes out of nowhere to the point I no longer care what happens afterwards.That's it. 600 characters.",10
"Dynamic woman fantastic show","I love the show any negative review must've come from a man this show is so fantastic Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston knock it out of the park keep them coming",10
"Great Acting, OK Writing","First off, the actors did excellent work here especially the uniquely-talented Mark Duplass. However, a few lines (about one every five minutes) are complete throw-aways and make no sense in the show. Lines like 'I've got a gun' as Jennifer Aniston was walking away from Carell in the rain didn't do anything and made the scene weaker. Many of the actors did excellent attempting to make the lines sound like emotional logic, but in the end, it was packed with 'stuffing...' very cliche stuff and dialogue used just to fill space. Apple seems to have missed the value of the pregnant pause in television drama, instead choosing to make sure someone is always speaking, and that the F word comes about every five words. Nothing really life-changing about this show-it seems mainly filler until they can come up with some better original content.",10
"Well written","Brilliant casting, well deserved nominations.
Jen is a very talented actress I always thought she is wasting her talent on the silly Friends sitcom. Steve is getting better year after year. Reese was the perfect cast for this role.
My opinion on the ""meto"" movement; it's silly, women should be ashamed of coming out after many years. They did accept the money,the job,the role. You can always say no to anything. And powerful women does the same. To be honest it's nature; bigger fish gets the smaller ones if they let themselves to catch ;) And if you accept what you get for it, I say go for it. :D Enjoying is an extra! If Steve Carell puts his hand under my skirt, he'll I say yes!😂",9
"WOW! How Relevant can a show get!","What an incredible surprise this show is! ALL of the characters are incredible! Each and everyone! But Billy Crudup is stellar! I recognized him from some other show, where he played an awful character-but played it well. I hope they keep him in the cast! I don't ever want to see this show end!",10
"Flip me it's good.","I never leave reviews, and was sceptical of this series, but just had to for this. Such a powerful, well structured ridiculously well acted series. The last episode is an absolute force. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed!",10
"Real world?","Well written, acted, produced, directed, but how are these people part of the fly over section of America? The make millions, they live in penthouses, have chauffeurs. You just want to yell who cares? Not in my middle class part of the country where I live. Where people have kids, older parents, mortgages, Covid,",6
"Jennifer like you've never seen. Amazing cast","I'm blown away by this show. How did I go so long without finding it. The cast. The writing. So well done. Jennifer Aniston in her best performance ever, as the selfish shallow Alex who finally discovers the meaning of friendship. Love the tie into the pandemic. Great show. Love Steve Carell in it too.",10
"Exciting to watch....but there's a but.","Really exciting to watch and I watched both seasons both in a rush! Season Two however takes a few turned however. I loved seeing Mitch back, and the writing and his acting is top notch. His character comes to live and transcends the show. Bradly is the focus of the first half of season two, and the writers struggled making their minds up. She, as an actor, can handle every script, but the director should have made a decision here. Than, the But. Jennifer Aniston. The second half of the show really leans on her performance and character. And that's just to much. We've seen all she can do, many times. She can look really sad. She can look very 'you can trust me'. She can act shocked, surprised and frankly it's just not enough. In season one it was a perfect fit, for season two the writing was just a tad too heavy for Jennifer. And it was distracting and even made we fast forward in the last two episodes.",7
"Wow...talk about misinformation","Armed militia? Actually, no.The remark about Bradley's uneducated family because they didn't wear masks and went to church? This show went from interesting to elite, preachy, judgy propaganda. The only breath of fresh air is Janko...sometimes, unless ""climate change"" comes up. The arrogance is not even subtle. It bashes the viewer over the head with ""if you don't believe everything we are preaching, you are an ignorant rube."" The characters habe become unlikeable and uninteresting. The first season showed so much potential. It dabbled in nuance, although it could have gone further to spur actual thought and civil debate about complex issues. Now, it's a just a pretentious black and white view of all topics, figuratively and literally.",1
"Finally, a good series","First of all, great actors. The ones I love, the ones that appeal to me and the ones that I feel are just perfect.Secondly, the drama is real, in the first season it's more about everyone, feels more global, in the second season it shifts more towards particular characters, but season still ends with a global thing.Top notch series about people trying to be best and still human at the same time. It's hard, but if you stay true and honest, it might get easier - that's what this show is about.Thank you so much for this show, finally I get to enjoy something good!",10
"Brilliant!","I stumbled across this masterpiece this morning on Apple TV and I absolutely loved it and watched all 10 episodes in one sitting and 100% do not regret it... roll on season 2!!!!",10
"Loved it!","Great performance! Jennifer Anniston is absolutely the best!",10
"One of the best","After watching the first two episodes I said to myself not bad at all, something new I was interested, then after the watching the other episodes I can say it's one of the best series of this year, at least top three, I can even say it's my favorite TV Show now. Jennifer Aniston & Reece Witherspoon! wow what a duo, I love the fact that it brings something different and new, and what's blow my mind is that they really used the element of surprise in the best way, this is why I can't wait for the upcoming episodes, this series has a big potential, I can see it as one of those very successful long series, not just a short mini series, but they have to think a lot about every details, and specially befor taking any big decision. at the end I'm so happy that I bought an Iphone and got my 1 year Apple TV Plus gift well done Apple great start.",9
"Great show, wonderful Jennifer Aniston","The show is great never boring and how I missed Jennifer and I glad she's back!
Reese also doing great as always and I really like their dynamic
Great start for Apple TV+",10
"Things Fall Apart","""'The Morning Show' on Apple TV is the best and most pertinent political drama I've watched since Aaron Sorkin's 'The West Wing'. Both deal with power in the hands of people presented as ordinary human beings. Sorkin's drama was of a different time and climate. It expressed the lingering idealism of the baby boomer generation. In a later show, 'The Newsroom', Sorkin explored the confluence of politics and media. As in 'The West Wing there's the sense of an omniscient moral order, watched over by benign patriarchal authorities, represented by Jeff Daniels and Sam Waterston, that invariably delivers on the side of truth and Justice (Law and Order).'The Morning Show' is a product of another century, when that very authority is under question and uncertainty reigns in the shadows of every institution. Its political and interpersonal machinations are at least as complex as those in another show of the era, 'Succession'. Both deal with issues of power and authority, but 'Succession' takes a more comedic approach, while 'The Morning Show' more aggressively and tragically addresses the real world.In 'Succession' the patriarch and his entourage are portrayed as fools, inhabiting an environment of almost cartoonishly excessive wealth and power. This is not a place where people have jobs, it's where they have 'positions' somewhere within the arcane mazes of control. It's a world drenched in male ego, where both men and women thrive and survive only by ruthlessly manipulating each other to gain the approval of the king. It's ultimately a game of abject surrender, in which a gaggle of fools gambol just at the boundaries where comedy and tragedy meet. In the end nothing in that world has substantially changed, and we go home satisfied that everyone pretty much got served what they deserve.Inspired by the real life sexual abuse scandals that emerged during the MeToo scandals that lead to the fall of power brokers at Fox News, 'The Morning Show' doesn't hold back in aggressively challenging the power of the king and the patriarchy. It takes the path of tragedy, in which the hubris and foolishness of each player is met with individual consequences.'The Morning Show' is about struggle and a heroic journey toward redemption. Every character is brought to the edge of a precipitous fall, and is severely tested with the choice between pure survival and risking everything for the pursuit of clarity. As in classic tragedy a sacrifice of innocence is required in order to bring down the king. No one emerges unscathed.At the end of the first season we've witnessed the inevitable fall, and are left with a little grief mixed with a sense of possibilities. The show leaves us with a hopeful motto, 'sic semper tyrannies', which translates, 'thus always to tyrants'.",9
"The Show was promising with Season 1 ...","... but it went downhill from there.I saw Season 1 a couple of years ago and I gave it an 8 rating. A great cast, a promising story, good writers. Season 2 kind of managed to keep up, also with the direct references to daily events, Covid etc. Still thought it is worth watching, although I could already sense it is going in a direction where I couldn't follow.Season 3 was nothing better than a high end soap opera set at a TV station. The newly introduced billionaire character is so highly unbelievable that you wonder who signed off on that script. I reduced it to 6 but only because it started off well. If I were to rate Season 3 on its own it would probably be somewhere between 4 and 5.",6
"Absolutely Incredible","Episode 4. The ending. So so powerful. Can't stop crying.The truth in this show. Thank you. Exceptional in every way.Must watch.",10
"Good show, but what was with the music?","I really enjoyed this show but was shocked at how bad the music supervision was. It distracted from the story and never really added to it. The scenes with opera were over done and trite. Closing with ""Clint Eastwood"" was insulting.",7
"Woke pile of bull****","First season was great but 4 episodes in on the second season and the ""wokeness"" is already well over done.So unfortunate. Reese Witherspoon can do so much better than this trash.",4
"Great all around series/directing/acting/production","The big name actors/actresses drawn me to this in the ads that I seen leading up to this. I was watching Ted Lasso on Apple TV n this was waiting in the wings for me. Great storyline and great plot and direction. Strangely it's very very comparable to the great series on HBO, The Newsroom. I really loved that one and I'm definitely gonna enjoy this series. I'm already on EP 4",9
"First season is a masterpiece, second starts low but gets better and better.","The first season is a tv masterpiece, fun and deep, one of the best programs I've ever seen. The second season is not as good, it stars a bit messy and not getting the right tone, but gets better and better, second season deserves patience. Mitch parts in Italy are the heart of the this season and evolves into a very juicy story line adding up the beginning of the pandemic, perfect mix of fiction and recent events. Difficult balance between Metoo movement and the concept of cancel culture, but the show treat the subject with honesty and balance.",10
"A GREAT SHOW","This TV series touches the bottom of heart, it reflects human nature, kindness and ugliness, justice or profits , always full of contradictions, but in the end, every decision is hard, yet it is the right one . Great work!",9
"The Let's Get Real Show","Wow, very moving to the point of watery eyes by the end of season 1. Down to the real, Cut the bs, Hypocrisy is overrated.
Excellent writing. Excellent Acting.
Thank you for this authentic work addressing real issues that yes need to be addressed.",9
"Amazing and SO important","This show is utterly amazing. On top of the incredible performances by all of the actors, this show reveals all sides of the Me Too movement, allowing the world to see that it's not just black and white. There are many sides of the story that show the faults of everyone involved and just how corrupt the world can be.10/10 recommend to everybody, no matter what your views are on the Me Too movement.",10
"A good show became just boring.","Season 1 was really good and there's not much to complain about. Refreshing, good acting, an important story and interesting. For me it was around 8 in imdb rating but after I seen season 2 that I think crashlanding into a rating of 5, I'm not so positive any more.The overall acting is still good, Steve Carell (Mitch) and Billy Crudup (Cory) are splendid. But sadly I can't get a grip of Jennifer Aniston. She's over acting or perhaps a more suitable English expression is ""ham it up"".Me and wife started to fast forward some scenes that didn't take the story anywhere and almost bored us into sleep, and thats not a good sign. It feels like they ran out of ideas and didn't know how to fill out all episodes.So if you thinking of getting AppleTV+ just to se season 2, I would say - think again.",6
"Brilliant","Jennifer Aniston and Reece Witherspoon did a brilliant job as producers and as actors. The Morning Show is a realistic, #MeToo-inspired, hard-hitting drama and I loved every minute of it. The whole cast is playing out of their skins: truly impressive!",8
"A Dagger Penetrating the Network","Frankly speaking, usually I would just copy and paste the trailer from YouTube and let you guys watch, but not this time. The soundtracks in this show are so fantastic that I just can't help going over again. (BTW the trailer is awesome, too)
Focusing on Alex Levy and Mitch Kesler, the TV hosts from a Network which produces a popular morning show for over a decade, its culture, behind-the-scene stories and scandals become increasingly intriguing among the public. And oddly, as the only show which hasn't been affected by the prevailing #Metoo Campaign, something is not right in this seemingly harmonious team. That day has finally come, the successful and beloved Mitch had been accused of severe misconduct over several females, leaving his co-host Alex unhinged at 3am in the morning.As an audience, you can easily feel the dramatic tension within the 2-3 hours before another day's morning show begins. You follow Alex to sleep, to wake up and work out, to go to work and get shocked by the heavy info, to sit on the chair of the show and broadcast the devastating news to America.",7
"The first season was fantastic. The second season is trash.","I was reluctant to watch the first season, knowing that the main storyline was about men in power controlling women. The me-too movement created the show, and I wasn't sure if I really wanted to watch it. I am a woman who has been through the trials and tribulations of every other woman, when it comes to being a woman in society. It was difficult sometimes devastating but I understood the game, and I didn't let myself fall into the trap where I was willing to relinquish my power for whatever I thought was the gain. I felt women, too many women ,were willing to give up their beliefs, their body and their power for a part, or a position, or some other recognition. I was in the same situation many times when I was younger, but I refused to give in. I didn't go to work hotel room at 2 AM. I didn't flirt with the man with the power ,I didn't do any of it. So when I see shows that want to make the women the victim, it upsets me. We are not victims. We are in control of our future. We are in control of what happens to us but we give it up because we're weak.But I watched the show anyway, and I actually thought they did an excellent job in portraying the difficulties with what women might think is keeping them where they're at, and where women are keeping themselves where they're at.But the second season is ridiculous. They go over the top ,they lean way left, and make it less realistic and more talking point, necessary for division, type of talk.They have one single character who wants to carry what those on the right believe, men, and women. And everybody else is fighting to make these unrealistic, ridiculous divisive, untrue, points of view.. real.Women, black, or white, young or old, are being taught to be the victim the lesser than the poor old me individual. And they are no lesser the victim now than they were in the 50s and 60s and 70s and 80s and 90s. They do not own some thing that didn't occur before. Those women who went through it with their head held high and refused to be part of it should be honored those that fell to the requests of the lower should not. Women are not victims. And to show it as such, is ridiculous. Black women are not the victims. Again, to show them as such ,is ridiculous.I pray that women of the future do not see themselves in this light as much as this society wants to push it. It's not true, and we are better than this. We are stronger than this. We are mightier than this.",3
"Loved It 100%","Surprising, well written, dynamic and humane. Strongly recommend. Excellent work.",10
"Men steal the show","Almost as good as Succession, but not quite. Duplass, Crudup and Carell are outstanding male actors. For once Witherspoon has to play second fiddle to a hammy and over reaching Anniston. Think Friends but without the jokes.
The musical evening party with Crudup and Anniston in duet was old school tv gold.
I knew Hannah was a gonna by the time of the Vegas episode.
Watch and enjoy.",9
"Exceptional Drama","I love this show so much. I've watched it four times now. Stand out performances from the whole cast. Steve Carrell deserves a nod. Exceptional performances from Billy Crudup, Reece Witherspoon and of course Jennifer Aniston. The writing is fantastic and the cinematography is too. I cannot wait for Season 2.",10
"A must see!","Outstanding cast and true masterpiece! Content is original and not a rewrite of another show with the same story line. You won't be disappointed. Unfortunately it's so good with only two seasons right now you'll finish pretty quick.",10
"Phenomenal from start to finish!","This show is flawless. From the writing to the acting, there wasn't a dull moment.",10
"Very Surprised","Having intentionally avoided anything and everything with Anniston and Witherspoon in it, I was predisposed to hate TMS but I was very surprised and extremely impressed by all aspects of the show.",9
"Too Much Bad Language For Me","If it wasn't for all swearing I would of given this show a 10, but unfortunately be of the use of Fword way to much and mainly by the women I can even bring myself to watch the 2nd episode.To be honest I find most of the ""original"" shows have way to much swearing and it just spoils it for me, I don't use the Fword and find it's just lack of vocabulary with people who do use it as their everyday language.It's a shame because there's so many programmes that's came out on a Netflix and Amazon that look great and I've really looked forward to watching them and then they are all just full of the Fword, it looks to me like Apple TV+ is going to be the same, I'll look at some other shows while I have this 7 day free trial but the chance are I'll be cancelling the subscription before the seventh day.I just wish I had more to say about The Morning Show but since I could get past the 1st episode all I can add is this, if you'll like the frequent use of the Fword and a show that's not a crime drama them it's worth a watch because I think the story lines are going are well written and well played, I'm gutted I could watch the full series.",7
"Amazing acting, especially Jennifer Aniston","I didn't know I would feel like a fly on the wall at the Today show.. The storyline is a little eerie when you think about it. It's also odd to see Steve play such a creep, but the acting is soo good. Jennifer should win an award. The finale was awesome.",9
"Smart, intelligent, funny","Epic and intelligent show. the way it studiy the way the world works in this day and age is brilliant. There will be people that gets it, and people that dont. But thank you for bringing this, in all its glory to us who do!
Great Show!",7
"Distinctly Average","Having watched the first season, I must say I wasn't impressed. Hypocrisy, abuse and corruption in mass media are usually great drama material, but this series
somehow manages to turn them into a complete snore-fest. Season 2 wasn't any improvement, as most plot lines were total misfires (especially when they had to deal with Covid etc). I read that the show has reached its fourth season. I don't know if it's worth so many seasons, for me it is a totally superficial show.As far as I have watched, the series seemed to be completely incapable of involving me, the viewer, in the emotional action. There is too much drama, when you least need it, and no drama at all when everything points to that direction.The main cast, although impressive, can't save the day either. Jennifer Aniston may be a very beautiful and successful woman, but her acting skills are fairly mediocre. She tries really hard here to be convincing, but all she can offer in the end is a little angrier, darker and twenty years older version of Rachel Green. As for Rees Witherspoon, I don't think she acts to her full potential in this show. Maybe because she is given very little to work with. Steve Carrel is a pozitive surprise, but it's clear that he is somewhat uncomfortable in his role. And, finally, we have Mark Duplass and Billy Crudup who make an honest efort to keep things interesting, but they can't work miracles. I won't comment on the other actors, as I think that the characters they impersonate are pretty much indifferent and not worth analysing. They are so immersed in their elitist microcosm, that after a point we simply can't find any reason to keep following their schemes and secrets.And, by the way, this constant arguing and shouting in every episode is really getting on the nerves. Not every one can write quality angry monologues like Aaron Sorkin. The creators have clearly overdone it in this respect. Just because you have your actors shout and rant, doesn't automatically mean that their characters are less shallow.To sum up, ""The Morning Show"" has some interesting cinematography and a shiny cast, but the end result is not as satisfying as expected.",5
"PRIDE (An alternative Title)","Watching Steve Carell portaying a morally deprived manchild is disturbing, and intruiging.When a man's sense of self and the ego's constant strive for everything that keeps it isolated from scrutiny intertvines; you get a predator.What I feel is missing is an active dialogue about the sense of pride that should be present in a depiction of everything that deals with one humans sense of self. No matter the sex.Pride is an ancient virtue not fit for the social climate of today, therefore it brakes an untold number of humans every day.The Character Hannah, portrayed by Gugu M-Raw, lacks what can easily be defined as internal guidance when it comes to self evalutation. Her Pride consumes her to the point of self harm and suicide.The missing two stars spell Pride, but in every other aspect of this review, this series has it all.Great acting, sensitive subject and tremendous screenplay.An extra kudo goes to Billy Crudup for an excellent portrayal of the visionary Head of the Newsdivision.",8
"Spectacular","I stumbled across this show and was hooked after 5 minutes.. Every moment is the show was written to perfection, every silent moment and character played an essential part to the show! The writers, cast and behind the scenes crew deserve an award for this masterpiece!",10
"Not so bad as for Apple one of the first tv series","Actor play is on a high level, so as story. But I could not watch it for two days, and as for me it's critical if series can't hold you from the beginning till the end in couple days, I spend nearly month to watch it. And season finale, it was so unexpected, I was guessing that one or another story be revealed, but they did very good job in it, for the finale definitely 10/10, overall I would put it 8/10 cause of a little bit overextended story, which could be shorter for couple hours",8
"Amazing acting","Jennifer Aniston, Reese witherspoon and Steve Carrell! They knocked it out of the park ! Some of the best acting I have ever seen. I believe their characters .This show is fresh and keeps you on your toes. I binged all 7 episodes in 2 days omg . Soooooo good",10
"Great!","Haven't stopped watching since I started 5 episodes ago. Great plot and cast.",9
"Captivating!","I've enjoyed this show because of the writing and excellent cast's acting. I almost didn't watch it at all and gave my 8 stars based on Jennifer Aniston. The first episode was all her and it was pretty bad. However, Reese Witherspoon saved the day. Overall, Aniston's acting has improved and she has evolved into the character. The rest of the cast is first rate and the dialog is quite believable. It's an interesting take on sexual predation in the workplace; both male and female (i.e. Claire). You will probably like it once you get past episode 1.",8
"Language, people!","This is good series that explores ""Me Too"" in an interesting and nuanced fashion, although I still feel there´s room to dig even a bit deeper into the subject.
All the actors does a terrific job, especially Aniston, who's emotions reached all the way into my living room and could be cut with a knife!I would rate this higher, had it not been for the absurd amount of swearing throughout season 1. We get it, swearing is now allowed on TV, but peppering the script with f-bombs, even in in places where they didn't even make sense, ruined a lot of the experience for me. It takes away from that every individual would realistically express themselves in various ways. There are so many brilliant, sharp and intelligent series that can tell a story without the crutches of severe profanity to make an impact. Variation would benefit the story as well, in my opinion,",6
"Strong story arc and superb cast","On the recommendation from a friend I started looked in to this series.
I incorrectly assumed from the cast list it was a comedy. Instead I was drawn into a well crafted drama. The nuances depicting different facets of a conflict avoids preaching, plus all the intrigue and twists over the first season, superbly directed, shot and edited kept me totally engaged.
The cast is a revelation of new depth from the leads best known for their comedy.I look forward to season two.",9
"Apple raised the bar of shows!!","If you have not seen the trailer of this show, dont see it.
Every episode takes you through a roller coaster of emotions because of how AMAZING is the acting, plot, editing.
Standing ovation for Reese witherspoon for her brilliant acting!!",7
"Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell","Jennifer Aniston stole the entire show and is the real star of The Morning Show! Her acting is that good. Steve Carell is very good too!
Never been a fan of Billy Crudup, but he really stands out with his character. I Haven't connected with Reece's character or storyline at all.",3
"Like a bad soap...","...with bad soap acting. The writing is preachy with every controversial topic shoehorned in. No likeable characters other than Billy Crudup. I think the world has had enough of coronavirus and the election, we don't need to relive it through a tacky badly written show.",9
"Expected Little, Greatly Surprised","Was expecting some PC nonsense, with a burnt-out star. Turns out the story line is great, fairly balanced, good acting. Aniston puts on a great performance. At episode 4 now and anything could happen. Looking forward to more.",9
"I think it's pretty great...","The writing is solid, not terribly clever but solid. And I enjoy watching the machinations of a typically saccharine front of house venue: morning television.",8
"One thing that's making it difficult...","To watch this show: Jennifer Aniston making faces all the time. Exaggerated faces of sadness, worry, whatever, all in the spectrum of lack of happiness or even normal for a change. It seriously distracting and so overdone it's becoming a caricature. I realize the character she plays is supposed to be a very famous and successful person who deep inside is really very fragile, but the show spends just too much time on this aspect, and frankly, it gets very tiresome.
Unfortunaly, other main characters are quite overdone too. Reeese Witherspoon is just way too ""human"" (as described by Aniston) and Mark Duplass too insecure to hold the job he supposedly has spent so many years in.Everything is way overacted, too too, and is getting pretty boring. I'm on the 5th or 6th episode (can't remember, there's not much happening anyway), Hoping for it to get better.It stared with a faster pace, a la ""West Wing"" with cameras shooting while the characters moved though corridors talking, and with a sense of urgency, but it is getting slower and slower and subplots are deviating attention from the main plot.Ok... I changed my rating because after the episodes I had seen, the show picked up speed and ended pretty well. I stand by what I mentioned in those first episodes, but it did get better, finally.",9
"Surprisingly good","I'm not generally a fan of drama but this been a great watch.The actor we're picked really well. Aniston is perfect for the role as is Reece.It can feel slow for about the first 20 mins but after got super interesting.Billy Crudup is by far my fav he is so smug but I love to watch him.There's plenty of swearing and the back and forth are really entertaining.I have watched episode 3 times already.Go watch it.",10
"A sincere bravo","Me watching a chick show ?! Nah...
And yet... This one is one of the top i have seen in a while . I do not know how much Amazon spent with all this , but is money well spent .
The cast, the writers, oh my...
Put it this way: it's late night , and i just finish to watch the fourth episode and yes, worth every bit or my precious time.
Special kudos to J.A. and R.W. for their fantastic job. Not being one , but Americans can consider themselves lucky to have such talented and wonderful ladies .",8
"Great start. Now tighten it up!","Reminded me a bit of Scandal until that went OTT. Good, sardonic scrip. Good intriguing story. A bunch of very good actors. For me, I'd like to see them let the strong script carry the show along more. A little more aloofness and impassivity. Make the twists a bit more surprising and shocking. The public personas contrasting more with the private characters. I guess that's down to the director.",6
"Excellent production in many respects","The sum of all its parts gives it a solid 10. Although much of the plot is predictable one is inclined to focus on each character individually and for that reason the plot delivers a vast array of separate but equal moving parts. Billy Cudrup could have possibly been replaced by Mathew Mconnaughey seeing they would have or could have been interchangeable. Jenny Anniston- I mean what can you say? A glowing performance from a multi faceted actress and of course the list of great A list actors is impressive. Even a minor part played by Shari Belafonte seemed to carry value whereby the whole NYC tv production environment feels so genuine through the diverse casting to give a feel of an NBC studio in real time. And somebody give me the name of the stenographer. Just stunning quality. Last but not least the me too theme had a double more subtle layer in that the series also presented the absolute generational friction which may have caused the whole me too phenomenon. Millennials just weren't taking it all lying down excuse the pun whereas the boomer crowd seemed to take sexual harassment at the workplace as all part of the game. Fabulous analysis and message. Great! See it watch it and love it.",10
"Wow.","I never thought I would see such an incredible series about a morning show. It's amazing.",6
"Complicated subject, good, but boiled down to one message","They went at a complicated subject from all angles, but to be honest, it all boiled down one message - ""Never have relationships with co-workers"", simply put. Every relationship, even the one in question, ended because the women were uncomfortable with how their co-workers looked at them. The offender was blamed for how people looked at the victim, which honestly made no sense, especially how she explained their whole situation. But i guess that was the point. Aniston did a good job portraying a role women are often in. At one point, the men just seemed expendable to everything, it was all about how their female co-workers felt, no matter what. Tho the one guy who was 'neutral' i guess, was the fall guy and put under the most pressure just being there. So in whole it was good, it wasn't preachy also the message was clear, and that's it.",2
"Good first season, 2nd Season over the top melodrama","It's a good idea but the only reason I watched it so far was to see how Billy Crudup played. He's good and I won't continue to watch this never-ending drama. There are too many shows like these heavy on the drama these days.",10
"Masterpiece","The entertainment value of the series is off the scale. Absolute masterpiece of television.",9
"Aniston's Best","Get this series ranked with the likes of Little Fires Everywhere, Big little lies and Sharper Objects. Reece Witherspoon is so consistently good, it doesn't matter what character she's portraying.The script convincingly takes the audience on a journey very few ever experience. The pace is good and I recommend if looking for an afternoon binge.",9
"Good Drama","Hopefully more scenes between jen and steve..Overall an interesting show...",9
"Real and raw","Slow to start off with but by mid-first season, I was absolutely hooked and the second season was brilliant. Incredible acting all-round. Julianna/Reese's chemistry in the second season was amazing and I love that everything is just based on real events. It makes everything feel more intense.",9
"Loved it","Really really good. I've been wanting to watch it for a while finally got around to it and I'm glad I did.",8
"Overall great show but to much swearing","Interesting show but way to much swearing at times. I like how the show deals with recent and current events. I like how the writers connected all the characters and involved them in those events. Seems to show only left side views on this show while completely ignoring the right. Examples being COVID and Pro choice vs. Pro Life. Some episodes better than others. I really enjoy the Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston duo they both bring something unique to the show. There area a few flashback style episodes randomly throughout the seasons which at first seem out of place and random but do give context to the following episode. Overall I think the show is pretty balanced between the seasons though was kind of annoyed with the constant Mitch Kessler stuff which seemed to carry on way to long.",7
"This series needs to come out and shine!","This is by far the best show I've ever seen in a long time.And I'm talking about real series that talk about real issues, not sci-fi or fantasy worlds, superheroes and whatnot (not to underate any of those genres, I do love them all). But this is too good to only have some small awards and an 8.3 rating here.This needs to come out!I've finished season 1 and I'm speechless 😶 Jennifer Aniston is brilliant! Steve Carrell is brilliantly disgusting (in a good acting way), and supporting roles such as Chip, Hannah, Cory and Claire are such complexes and well made characters that this show can only get better and better (hopefully). Anyhow, this is my take on this season 1, do watch it! And spread it around. This needs to be seen.",10
"This is by all means a great show","I mention some scenes, and their cinematography/editing but don't explain the story, or the script within them, so I don't know if this review really contains spoilers.This is a really good show, with a story that hasn't ever been envisioned in film the way this show does. The cinematography is simple, but so well planned it makes every shot matter, and the story arc of every character is beautiful to watch.The lead characters, though unlikable at the start, slowly develop into characters that are real, and make you feel their good side. In essence the character development of the whole show is beyond impeccable, and show the reality of sexual discourse in a real manner, that is not cringe or overly dramatic.However the acting feels odd and scripted at times, with awkward pauses between people talking that don't feel like reality, these distracted me from the story from time to time.But I must say, every episode feels like a separate film in in of itself, And I don't mean that by saying that it feels like a different series entirely, but rather that every episode has a clear beginning, middle, and end that I see a lot of shows miss nowadays and I wish more had them.The script itself, is very cringe and unrealistic at points, and it's obvious that the actors found some lines weird to say. By no means is the script bad though, just odd.Now, the editing of the series is a mismatch, there are some great editing choices throughout the show, some that I would say are Oscar worthy. However there are so many scenes that could have been placed in different places to make pacing better. One part that struck me as amateur and wanted me to throw up as a filmmaker, was the part where Hannah was walking away from a scene, and clouds come in to dip to white and reveal Mitch. You'll know when you see this scene transition as it's just awful. I don't see why a fade out and cut when the phone rang wasn't an option.Overall though, editing was ok, and the way the editor used cinematography rather than sound to show story elements of the show was rather well done. I feel like the series had hired 2 Oscar editors, and one student who's learning how to use avidScript: 6.5/10Character development: 9/10Editing: 5/10Cinematography: 8/10Acting: 6.5/10Overall I'd give this show a well deserved 70/100.",7
"Dead air...","I gave this show a chance and watched 5 episodes. Although it has a great cast, I just couldn't keep watching. It started off interesting but then became very repetitive. The angry Jennifer, the no filter Reese, the weenie producer, and the continuous dead air. There are many scenes where people say nothing and it drags on and on and on and on and on and on. There's no variety to this show.",4
"An INCREDIBLE show","It's been three days since I finished the show, and I can't stop thinking about it! Jennifer Aniston gives the performance of a lifetime, and Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell and the rest of the cast are so wonderful, you can't take your eyes off of them! Each and every one of the actors is stunning, the photography is just marvelous, the plot is always interesting and never (never!) boring, an overall great experience! At most scenes, I realized that I was holding my breath! A huge congrats to Apple+, and to Good morning sunshine, for this amazing show! Can't wait for season 2!!!",10
"Don't miss a true gem.","This show is really great, and I had to take breaks to make the binge watching last longer than a day. Billy Crudup and Reese Witherspoon are shining among the other actors on the show. The subject is serious, the script is well written, photo is top class, even the music is perfect.I really can't wait for the next season to be aired, in the mean time make sure you watch the first season, hopefully you'll get blown away, I was.",10
"Excellently written","Casting is phenomenal as is the camera work. I enjoy the current events written into the timeline. I don't know what everyone else is talking about with season 2 not being as good as season 1 as I completely disagree. Especially episodes 6-8. Not giving up any details but I found the story riveting. Looking forward to catching up and seeing where it goes from here and how they write about our messed up political environment currently. Curious about how they will script the impeachment and January 6th. Looking forward to more. Truly a well done piece that's reminiscent of the whole Matt Lauer debacle. It's refreshing to see they're exposing all this in close to real time.",9
"Incredible Must watch series.","I binged this series in just 3 days I couldn't get enough of it. Steve Carrel was well cast. He is so likeable he fits in perfect as the person you'd least expect to be THAT guy. You start off feeling sorry for him that he'd gotten caught up in the #me too movement and then as the show progresses it comes to light that he is exactly what they said he was.Jennifer Aniston character Alex perfectly portrays the generation that accepts the misogynistic/ boys club that sexualises women and makes excuses their behaviour and the twists and turns are just *chefs kiss*
The finale had me in tears and it has stuck with me.",10
"A MUST WATCH","This show is so top notch that I don't even have the words to describe it. I seriously cannot get enough. If Apple continues to produce content of this caliber, they're going to blow Netflix out of the water.",10
"Important show!","Great show in the aftermath of the #metoo movement, and it shows how important it was that it all was dragged out into the spotlight. Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell are awesome as always. I have kept myself far away from Reese Witherspoon before, ever since I watched her awful Legally Blonde movies, but here she's just amazing. I can't wait for a season two, although I have no idea where it would go.",8
"Wow! I didn't expect to love this so much!","This show does a brilliant job of showing the complexity of being a working woman in a mans world, and how the Me Too movement has really turn life on its head for both sexes. It's such a huge topic and an important dialog for men and women to be able to have and understand. I loved that this show dealt with the repercussions of what confronting that reality has on everyone in a powerful corporate workplace. It deals with the impact of when the penny drops, makes you ask yourself what it means and looks like to be complicit - especially as a women. The writing is brave, smart, nuanced and empathetic. The cast was terrific. Every single one of them. I was so happy to see Billy Crudup onscreen. I've been a huge fan since Inventing The Abbott's, and Crudup was made for this role. Aniston was truly excellent, yo-yoing between being sympathetic one minute, and unsympathetic and borderline the next. More than that, she deftly reflects what it's like to be a hardworking, ambitious women who grew up like so many others .....to be groomed to ignore what's really going on around them, especially if they're succeeding. I applaud this show for focusing on what the Me Too movement meant for a person in that position. It hasn't been easy for most people and it shouldn't be because it too big and too important - as this show stresses - to sit on.
And aside from the topic - the writers and producers have just put out a flat-out compelling TV show that is also surprisingly fun and bingeable. Definitely check it out.",7
"One of the best series out there!","Rarely does a show (really) suck you into it's world and get a sense of what the characters are going through - This one does. Superb cast and script. While the big names are there, the scene-stealing gem is Billy Crudup.",9
"Four because the first season.","Only the first season has the quality, which was promised and delivered. Good directing, writing, cast and characters. Very enjoyable and engaging.From the second season it was something totally different with the same actors. Poor directing, writing, over the top dramas, sudden changes of the stories. Pointless situations and dialogues. Very-very soapie. What a waste.Season 1 showed so much potential all the way. After that it was hoping, that the next episode is better. Next season is better...quit in the middle of the last season because it was waste of the time for last three seasons.Directors and writers underestimate the viewers.If directors and writers really think, that seasons 2-4 have the same overall quality, then someone has to tell them.IMDB should allow to rate the season separately. We all know how series with its seasons and different writers and directors can change the course of the quality.",4
"Every episode is Gold","There's not many shows where you find yourself shouting ""YES!"", crying, and then left with your mouth on the floor utterly aghast - every episode.
Everyone is fantastic.
Who knew Aniston could act?!
Billy Crudup is just fantastic.
Just watch it. You won't regret it.",10
"Excellent show!","This show has everything! Drama, infidelity, betrayal, truth of life even tho is ugly, it will keep you at the edge of your chair, highly recommend it.",9
"Outstanding!","Loved it! It was moving, relatable, entertaining. Writing is absolutely impeccable. Can't wait for season 3! Must watch! Such a great story with great actors. Wish there were more shows with this quality.",9
"Absolutely Incredible!","I was captivated from beginning to end. The writing is so exciting and beyond intriguing. So many complex layers to this series and all the actors gave performances of a life time. I couldn't recommend this enough. Incredible.",10
"For the girls","I'm only 3 episodes in but it's so refreshing to see so many women leading the charge.It's passionate and explores the intricacies of the damage SA does. It doesn't shy away from tough conversations or tough women OR feminine rage.I for one am thrilled to see some women screaming and fighting for their opportunities.And for the people (who I can only assume are men) who describe Billy Crudup as a reason to watch the show, they are either totally misogynistic or just totally dumb to the entire point of the show. This isn't about the men. Yes they're brilliant actors telling difficult stories (& well) but this is about the women. The women and their stories.",9
"Wake-up call","Wow. What a powerful series. The story arc is as good as it gets, the acting spectacular. I'd like to phone everyone involved to congratulate them. But I can't. So here's a 10/10 rating instead. Oh, and for anyone complaining about the swearing, you probably haven't worked in a tv newsroom!",10
"Good writing","Aniston's character is probably the real Jennifer Aniston. I think that's what makes it fun to watch. Steve Carrell always deliver a great performance.",7
"Interesting, Excellently made, The Best of 2019","A series that I underestimated a lot in terms of script. I thought that many things in the plot were going to become obstacles, turning the plot into a fairly simple one, but they ended up being excellently complex developments that attracted me incredibly. First of all the subject seemed very interesting. To see what's behind the news shows that we regularly watch. The acting work of the majority seems great to me, but I highlight the performance of Jennifer Aniston since I never saw her in such a dramatic role and I was really surprised in a very good way. I liked how they worked with the two main characters, especially in episode 4, ""That Woman,"" when they interview Bradley's mother (flashbacks) seemed genius to me. As for Alex, I liked that his family problems outside the program were developing (topic that was half hanging, I hope it continues in the second season). But I found it very repetitive to be treated as selfish in absolutely all discussions, (I mean they had no other problem to give the character?!) Maybe it is done so that this internal problem of Alex keeps developing in Season 2. Mitch is a character who at the beginning looked like he was made to fill out screen time due to the consequences of the dismissal. We soon realize that he is a character that will greatly influence in the plot due to his desire to reverse his situation as a person. Even ruined, he manages to make kind of a civil war inside the show, causing them to fire Chip and more conflict between Alex and Bradley. This series has the best season finale I've seen in a long time. The last episode is excellent and shows that The Morning Show has a lot to give in the second season.",10
"Surprisingly great","I definitely avoided looking into this show because it just... didn't seem good. If I didn't get a free year subscription of Apple TV with my phone, I would've NEVER watched it, even with all the awards/buzz it got this year. But wow. The casting is phenomenal, like many people have said.To cast stars who have been fixtures in Hollywood for decades was a bold and almost unsettling move. Seeing these characters emote and garner sympathy (or anger), all the while knowing that the actors who play them are also caught up in a changing film/tv industry due to the Me Too movement... it was a lot to take in. I felt like many of the characters were beautifully (almost frustratingly) complex, and I appreciated that.Some of the characters (Bradley and Hannah in particular) had moments where they were written to be conveniently naive... moving with an innate confidence in some moments and then acting as if they don't know how the industry works in other moments.For Bradley, deciding to meet with Mitch by herself, when she knew his history and his level of desperation-- that seemed like a rookie move for an experienced journalist who wants to get to the bottom of Mitch's misdeeds. For Hannah, going straight to the head of UBA, an older wealthy man, to report the misconduct of Mitch, another older wealthy man, seemed like something most women in a hierarchical setting like that know not to do... I can concede that she was incredibly upset and, as she said, ""acting out of character"" (+ she later reported Claire's relationship with Yanko to HR, seemingly as a way to right her own wrong for never going to HR about Mitch).But as a woman of color, I cringed hard, watching that scene when she, in a moment of deep pain and confusion, exposed her vulnerabilities to the wealthy white man who leads the entire network-- no back-up or blackmail or anything. I think maybe my frustrations with her character are a result of having so little faith in/respect for institutions that operate in the shadows like that. It was a great scene. Another phenomenal scene was Alex going to visit her daughter in boarding school. Just exquisite, the way their entire conversation unfolded.I'm excited to see more of Audra + the ""Minority Report"" folks in season 2. They deserve more than to be relegated as a side plot and everyone knows it. Cannot believe they made us watch Alex and Cory sing an *entire* show tune but couldn't spend time on a backstory for Alison Yamazi.",7
"ANISTON'S ACTING IS ACCEPTABLY POOR. REESE IS FANTASTIC.","Reese Witherspoon is absurdly talented and Oscar Level actress. GREAT PERFORMANCE.Jennifer Aniston lacks talent, always have so for a profound character, it comes to light, for a Rachel in Friends, outstanding.
Anyway, she has charisma and is pretty. So we all love her. An acceptable performance but not good! People who say its good say it cause they like her.
Acting wise, its a 6 out of 10.Show is FUN, good, well written.MY FAVORITE CHARACTER AND ACTING BY FAR IS BILLY CUDRUP AS COREY ELLISON. HE's just really fun and comfortable in the role. It suits him perfectly.",4
"Boring crisis mode","This show has gone downhill. The first season was good, not great.Season 2 was ok and now season 3 is unbearable. The episodes are always in crisis mode and none of the characters are likeable. They do deal with current topics but its done in such a pedestrian way that it bores me to death. I only watch it still because the cast is amazing and I want it to redeem itself but the writing is atrocious. I am speaking of being a huge fan of Succussion and their writing. Succussion writing is supurb because it was witty and entertaining and drew me in, even though I have no interest in business ethics. I wish The Morning Show had a smidge of wit. The dialogue is just so dry and boring. And because every episode is in crisis mode, character development is non exsistent. This amazing cast deserves better than this.",10
"A must watch","Absolutely phenomenal! Specifically performances by Jennifer Aniston and Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Positively engaging television.",8
"A positive echo of the shows I've previously loved","'The Morning Show' may not be as clever as 'West Wing', as charming as 'The Newsroom' or as adroitly melodramatic as 'Unreal' but it's a welcome plug into the sinkhole those programs left behind. In between all the super hero and crimes series, we need more that speaks to us about real issues. Far bigger than the Me Too theme is the need for corporate Media accountability, and punishment for its failure to tell us the truth about almost everything.",10
"My new favorite!","Well written, interesting characters, love love love!",10
"Loved their courage","Im just a simple guy from Argentina and i honestly had lower expectations. When i first started i found a narrative about all the social issues we gotta face nowadays. The me too is never left behind, but is introduced to us from all perspectives, the impact of the cruelty in the media, the problems That women in bisness have still handle it, the relation ship between Alex and Bradley..: how it evolv. I just can say no more... JUST WATCH IT",10
"so good","It's really satire. Although this show may not be too short, it has a completely different place among what I've seen so far. With a budget the size of GoT, it was certain that it would be a quality business, but it wasn't for entertainment like GoT, and it was impressive with both the filming and the actors and the storyline.",8
"Amazingly, Morning Show Has a Lot to Say About Communication Failure","While the scenario can appear to be too fantastic and at the same time not fantastic enough to be true, in general, Morning Show is honest in depicting the different people who became a part of the one problem. There are people losing their sense of good and evil because of incredible power and influence. And there are people who keep silent about nasty things happening to their colleagues. What makes this situation even more complex is that there are people who don't want to keep silent but who knows if they are right at what they are saying?Today, when Cancel Culture has some significance, it's easy to forget that ""canceled"" people continue to live and strive to live well, have friends, and so on. I can't say that this theme is notably highlighted in Morning Show but at least this side is not ignored. Which is great, to be honest. Because life goes on and it's always interesting to take a look at what happens to these people whose terrible deeds were revealed and condemned. But don't mistake this interest in these people's feelings for the attempt to acquit them or put the blame on victims! And that's not something that Morning Show does! Much more attention is focused on how power reveals people's weaknesses. Both male and female characters are prone to abusing their power.Morning Show is attempting to answer many of the questions asked by those who don't share positions supported by the #MeToo movement and other human rights movements. More or less realistically, the series shows how women end up in the bed with their bosses and how they cannot say ""No"" even if they categorically don't want to stay with them. Morning Show demonstrates what people are capable of when they prioritize their careers over being humane and what stands beyond the ""silence is violence"" tag line. Racial issues are in the place, too. In general, I see that Morning Show is about people who afraid to be honest with others and themselves and which disasters it drives.The real problems are more complex and the ""Cancel"" button is a poor solution to figure out who's to blame and what to do. I'm glad that this show is not avoiding the entanglements of life and manages to stand on the kind positions.",7
"This is awesome!","Apple spent a lot of money and time on this show and you can tell that every minute you're watching. Plus the acting and writing talent is just oozing off this. I love/hate the streaming wars because we're getting incredible quality content right now, but this can't go on forever, the services will have to start making money someday, and the quality will start to match network tv. At least we'll be getting some really good shows like this for the next couple of years!",9
"F bombs are annoying","I like the actors. Story Is interesting but the language is a huge turn off. Based on the me too movement. Not sure which morning show that they are talking about.",6
"Loved almost all of it","I loved this show and I really liked every character but one. Witherspoon's character annoyed me every episode. It's completely unrealistic to pull a no name field reporter from WV immediately onto a premier national show. More so, she made me cringe more than enjoy her. That being said, every other character was fantastic and I loved seeing Aniston in a different role! The story was great- it kept me wanting to watch more. Only because of the unrealistic nature of sitting Witherspoon's character into a major news corporation did I knock off a star",3
"In a word: frustrating","In a word, this show is frustrating. So much potential. Great acting. Good story. But the creators/writers/directors failed. Every episode should have been 15-20 minutes shorter. It just drags in some places. They even choose not to give important moments to the brilliant actors, instead silencing them and letting music play over. Ugh.",8
"Jennifer Aniston is not good.","Season 1 was pretty good but season 2 is a mess. The story line is all over the place. But most of all, Jennifer Aniston is not good. There's no other way to say it. Her bad acting is very distracting and ruins the show for me.",10
"I love it","Storyline: 8
Writing: 7
Acting: 9
Cinematography: 10
Can't wait for next episode: 10Special note: Jennifer Aniston's amazing acting (also completely gorgeous).",10
"Fantastic","Honestly, when I started it, I was never expecting it to be such a gripping, intimate story at all. I thought it would be a little pretentious since it's dealing with cliches like victimhood, show biz, glamour, manufacturing news.It's quite a surprise that the makers let the leads take so much screen time with commendable presence.The performances are simply amazing and I can't wait to watch the 2nd season.",10
"Drama. Entertainment. Drama.","The swirling drama of this show is uncanny! The morning show does not start slow; starts with a scandal and it ends on a scandalising note. There is no episode on the show that you would want to skip. There brilliant actors play the roles brilliantly; the dialogues are fluent and chemistry is effortless.The show underlines the harassment culture that goes on in an extensive network. There are unique and insidious characters that come out of the shadows and display human emotions that u can relate to and not hate or dislike. Even with the drama that revolves, the show does not lose focus from its main storyline of news.There are many known faces that make and appearances and leave without eating unnecessary screen time. That most of the first season goes on in picking up the crumbs of the first episode of that rattles the news division. Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are made for morning show (or they are too versatile to play any role) the same cannot be said Steve Carell - one cannot separate The Office laughter of Michael Scott.",10
"Wonderful!!!","The cast, always of the highest level, is enriched by an excellent Julianna Margulies who plays one of the most interesting characters of the season. An always compelling story with extraordinary performers. To see all in one breath. I look forward to season 3.",10
"Awesome stuff!","Thought provoking, excellent and powerful drama. They approach the subject from all angles. Well done to everyone involved with this show!",7
"Great and unique show!","Excellent acting, very great music scene
I think these show best show in 2019",9
"It's rare...I thought possibly impossible for me to be a woman of few words...","But:1. Combining America's two sweethearts = Brilliant
2. Letting Jennifer Aniston finally shine in her true acting glory = Beautiful
3. An all star cast with a clearly amazing team of writers = Unheard of, until now.Best. Show. EVERBravo.Kristen Susemihl <3.",7
"Unveiling the Media Maze","I recently watched the ten-episode American mini-series, ""The Morning Show,"" a captivating portrayal of the behind-the-scenes dynamics of a morning television program.The series unfolds as a compelling exploration of the intricacies within media organizations. It delves into the events orchestrated and navigated by media executives on one side, while exposing the challenges faced by media personnel and the counteractions taken by hosts and producers against their superiors on the other.The central theme revolves around the pervasive issue of sexual harassment within the media, demonstrating how ""The Morning Show"" utilizes this subject to captivate audiences. The series sheds light on how such a sensitive topic is exploited to engage viewers, reflecting the harsh reality of media sensationalism.While the show offers valuable insights for journalists and media professionals, its relevance may be limited for those who do not experience the same level of editorial freedom portrayed in the series.Produced by Apple TV, ""The Morning Show"" premiered in November 2019, and its narrative weaves a complex tapestry of media politics, ethical dilemmas, and the struggle for truth in the world of morning television.",3
"Just gets better and better!!!!","This is a slow starter, but the character build-up and finale are some of the best tv I've watched in years. Watch it, you will not be disappointed!!!",7
"Amazing script, excellent plot, astonishing performances","The context, the facts behind the scenes of a most successful TV show, may be intriguing but it is the unfolding of the main characters together with them addressing questionable ethics in modern societies, that makes this series a ""top-shelf"" choice when it comes to fascinating yet honest entertainment.
This is an impossible to resist from watching series.",4
"Well...that went downhill quickly...","I watched the first series and whilst it was quite good I wouldn't say it was brilliant,and I proceeded to watch series 2...
Someone likened series 2 to a bad soap opera,this is the perfect example of toe crunchingly embarrassing tv.The characters are so one dimensional and annoying I wanted them all to perish!!!It's basically saying all tough people are flawed and really nice people if you get to know what's underneath...
Too many slow mo montages with ridiculous sad music and actors looking wistfully into the distance,trying to purvey angst...
Very lazy writing and I had to force myself to watch the last 4 episodes just to say I had watched it
I have rated the series based on season 2 because it was so awful I forgot half of what happened in season 1
Season 2 in summary is awful...don't bother.",10
"Excellent thought provoking series. Great script. Great acting.","I expected terrific acting from Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carrell, but Jennifer Aniston was amazing in this series too. Truly the best performance of her career so far.This is a really thought provoking series, especially Steve Carrell's character's self justification scenes and his complete lack of self awareness.The biggest problem with The Morning Show is that it's not widely available to view. It deserves a much bigger audience than it's going to get on one very limited platform.",10
"OMG!!!! Wow. Just wow!!! **SPOILERS**","This show from the very first ep to the last is outstanding.
Never have i been so invested in a storyline as this one. Kudos to Jennifer Anniston & Reece Witherspoon, the last episode was EXCEPTIONAL!
Devastated by Hannahs death but what came from it was every bit deserved.
Well done to all on this show, you've done an incredible job that you should all be proud of. Big Respect.",10
"Great acting, meaningful storyline, excellently portrayed in a real life scenario","After hearing about this show for over a year, I wasn't intrigued to watch it with the assumption it was another RomCom, and not a hard hitting drama. I am very pleased to say I was mistaken. This show is packed with emotion, important dialogue, and portrays both sides of controversial topics. Some, that make you think in ways normal TV does not. The acting by Billy Crudup, Jennifer Anniston, Karen Pittman, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw left you with no doubt that the Emmy nominations were correct.
I finished this season literally standing with anticipation, and will be the first to watch Episode 1 Season 2 on the release date.
Don't sleep through The Morning Show, they know what you want to see.",10
"Good start and a great Finale","Things started like a typical drama series as the trailer suggests and they start getting messy and messy at the morning show and then the directors tie everything together slowly and give a thumping finale. As a hardcore friends fan, I kinda liked Reese witherspoon's performance over Jennifer Aniston's. Really impressed with the show and the plot of season 1. Can't wait for S2.",9
"About this tv series","I've seen lots of tv series and when I started to watch this one I thought that it would be an ordinary tv series like other but after watching this show and especially last episode I realized that it's very good and exciting. I prefer you to watch it and I promise you won't regret it.",8
"Loved the show, not the ending","The choice of actors and the acting was awesome. The drama really drew us into the show. The constant changing alliances and hypocrisies I think really represented the human character well, especially where money and fame are involved. The show highlighted how much one person's bad behaviour can affect so many people and so much.I wondered how they would wrap up so many negative character issues at the end.....and how did they do that?First, during the interview between Reese's character and the author of ""the book"" - it was powerful yet ended in a speculation by Reese's character ""well perhaps it's a different Alex now"". Just wimped right out into this fluffy speculation. Lame. Typical soap opera style.Then, Jennifer's character gave a minimum of 3 ""heartfelt speeches"" to a variety of groups, finally ending the show on her last televised speech of ""so sorry"" working it's way to ""f...k everyone, I'm me.""Very heavy ending which really left us viewers absolutely nowhere. I loved the show - right up until the last 2 episodes.",9
"Reese Witherspoon makes this great!","Was slow to get into but once Reese came in it was awesome! She brings her authenticity to this role like all her roles. The honesty about the metoo stuff was also refreshing",7
"I'll bet it'll get better","The leads plays well as they always do but they're surrounded middle class backstage actors who doesn't do them any good.The story is exciting which makes it worth watching for at least another episode.",10
"Delightful surprise.","I watched the first episode and was only half interested. Then I started the second episode and I was in. The casting of this show is great. I really enjoyed the dynamics of everyone in the cast. This show has everything going for it. Can't wait for season 2!",6
"Season 1 was good","Enjoyed Season 1 but expected it be to better, second season doesn't have the same feel. Season one has a great build up to a singular point that is entertaining, emotional build up but satisfying ending. Season 2 starts off slow with some boring filler scenes. Season 2 gets better as it goes on however Season 1 still was much better.",1
"The first season was watchable, even good.","Good lord, did the writers from the first season get fired? The second season is all about elitist ideas of identity politics with a jumbled and messy storyline that somehow manages to still be predictable.",9
"Standing applause. Fully hooked.","A very interesting show.
Jennifer Aniston's is obvious, but the role of Witherspoon, Billy Crudup and Mark Duplass is remarkable.
A delicate story and with a lot of reality. What happens behind the scenes is a totally different world.
I'm waiting for the second season.",10
"It feels real","This show captures reality on many fronts. A lot of people watch morning news but over the years, we have been enlightened as to what has been going on for many years unchecked. It is a brave dive into the realm of #metoo and the politics and scandals that are not always visible to the outsider. The casting and acting is wonderful. Bravo Apple!",8
"Being optimistic and it works!!","Urmm, I just finished this incredible show and it's good. From the 1st episode it got me and i binge watched like by sitting on whole day. I must say it has all the energy you want from a show and the story and camera works which i dig the most. Can't wait to see the next season 2. !!",10
"Amazing drama","I watched this in a recommendation and couldn't have been more grateful! It's a really interesting look into a work place and with uncomfortable but for me relatable topics. Sexual misconduct, organised company restructures, cover ups,Stellar cast, intriguing story line with dysfunctional characters and amazing sound track.",8
"A very shouty drama but good none the less","I'll start with the negative to get it out of the way, there are other emotions when upset (Jennifer and Steve in particular ) other than over the top shouting - they SHOUTED ALOT whether upset, frustrated or surprised. I also still don't rate Jennifer Anniston as a great actress but Steve Carrel played over the top creepy well. I was hooked however and found it stylish and entertaining with good sub plots. Probably one of the most entertaining pieces of drama on 2019.",9
"I am someone who hates liberal shows (especially crap like Watchmen) - And I love this - its what shows should be","Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are perfectly cast. The slow is not conservative, not liberal, it represents all points of view well and does not make the mistake so many shows make (OMG the NEWSROOM HBO Sucked). This is not smug. After Episode 3 it hits a beautiful stride that makes it to the finish line - an example for how shows still can reach a broad audience and have political tones.",7
"The Melodrama Show with Jennifer Hasbeen","This is Hollywood hasbeens trying to be clever and failing. No, the social commentary is not poignant nor is it even interesting. Over acting on the part of, mostly, Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carrol and Reese Witherspoon is nauseating.The only purpose for this show is for these actors to remain relevant by tapping into much too exhausted topics. The emo melodrama of Anniston is particularly over the top. It just doesn't work and is too tiring to invest in.Martin Short? Really? Is this really Apple TV competing with prime time melodramas?Production quality is good overall, but it feels like a prime time drama aired in the 90s on NBC cuz CBS and ABC wouldn't have it. My advise is to not have it either. Nobody cares how much these hasbeens can fake cry 🙄",10
"rivetting","A well made show with a rivetting plot worth enjoying.",7
"Powerful, amazing acting","This show is unbelievably powerful! The acting is everything, every actor is seen in a completely different way than they have before. Some of the episodes are hard to watch, I've seen the first 10, but trust me it's a great show.",4
"Beautiful Cinematography, One World Viewpoint, House Of Cards goes To Showbiz","I watched the whole series in one day. I took breaks, but I wanted to see if the story arc surprised or was unpredictable - it wasn't. The latter observation doesn't mean it wasn't good story telling - and for the most part - it was.However, some of the main characters, while compelling, were one note.
Plus, call me a prude (though I have written for television and worked in nightclubs, so I am not sheltered) - but even so, the over-the-top profanity is only normal by Hollywood standards.It has already been debated here, whether or not, that this is Liberal propaganda ...but, in what world is the Reese Witherspoon character supposed to be a Conservative? She is described that way by others. Seriously? Is it merely because her character is from the South? That's so odd, because every view she expresses or action she takes would contradict the latter characterization. (She has a casual one hour stand at one point, and uses someone herself, her views on Fracking (Coal industry) and abortion are definitely not conservative. As for her even possibly being a Libertarian, that doesn't play either. A comedian friend of mine use to describe Libertarians as being ""the Hippies of the Right."" That sounds cool, but that's not applicable either. Her character never once expresses a Conservative viewpoint, nor even a remotely Libertarian one? In fact, she has a line about Liberals putting laws in place that Conservatives take away. (For the most part, a Libertarian wouldn't be in favor of most laws that EITHER side would enact.)Having lived and worked in Hollywood, I know the political shots in this series might be seen as Liberal propaganda...but it is just that there is only one point of view allowed. At those points, that's when the story flatlines, because it is preachy. It shows the other side only as evil or stupid, with no credible response. In a perfect dream world, we always see ourselves as having all the answers, with an opposing view as a caricature sputtering nonsense. So those who write and produce this series get to do that. However, this show isn't brave enough to really question any of it's presumptions. Now, in trying to show some different aspects and views/experiences on ME TOO, they do succeed more. Yet even there, when they try to make a few characters noble...as another character says ""Kettle meet Pot."" In the real world, certain female celebrities who claim to be feminists tried to take on the mantle of ME TOO. It is not a secret (at least in Hollywood), that a couple holier than thou actresses and a beloved talk show host positively enabled Harvey Weinstein and others..(meanwhile, Mira Sorvino DID take a stand early on and her career suffered! Yet, she was not heralded like others who sometimes used it to their advantage and kept quiet until the felt safe to say something. Great - they certainly were no heroines to the women who came after, but Mira Sorvino should have been.! In fairness, this series does try to address that...(but not as accurately as it might have, because that would have taken real courage.)So look, this is definitely an entertaining series , good acting, beautiful cinematography, but predictable story telling. As for accuracy - it is what it is. Even so, as far as realistically and fairly presenting characters with differing point of views - House Of Cards did a better and more compelling job. But as the star of the latter series was guilty of what this series explores - it goes around and around as Hollywood is never quite as brave as it gives itself credit for.",9
"Did someone say 'jumped the shark'","Oh dear, well the first 2 seasons were so good but unfortunately we have a case of 'we jumped the shark' for season 3. I'm not sure how a stellar cast took the table read for this season. Is it suppose to be a comedy now?? Not good, not good at all. May I refer you to Happy Days....please bow out gracefully! Whoever was the writer of this season needs to take a hard look at themselves. No doubt this will be the final season because there is no coming back from this one! Of course Reece Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston are perfect with the dismal dialogue they have to work with. Oh well it was good while it lasted.",8
"Great show and cast","I love Jennifer Aniston role in this show. There may be better actresses, but she does deliver what is important. . That is 'How life works for 1%' and how they get by with it. Thank you all for delivering this important and interesting show!",9
"It's in the journey","After watching a few of episodes of The Morning Show, I found that the characters and story develop rather nicely and it touches on some topics that are current day discussions. I look forward to see how it continues to develop and mature.",10
"Unapologetically Bold, and Honest","I would hate to give any spoilers so I'd still to the performances, story telling.Performances of the entire cast, protagonists and supporting characters alike are incredibly powerful.The character arcs are well written. The motivation of every character is evident and quite clear from the beginning. Performances are thoroughly engaging and all the parts are given to artists that have done a remarkable job.Direction is A++ even though the directors for each episode are different, there is cohesiveness in all the episodes and the vision of storytelling remains the same.I don't want to put any spoilers so I'll just say I highly recommend the show. It's a must watch!",10
"Really Good! Absolutely Fantastic!","Absolutely fab work by everyone involved in this show - it's just stinking good!!! Clearly based around a real incident - but it's soooo much more than that! It's just really good!",10
"a gripping must watch","Binged this during lockdown, and gotta say: this is possibly aniston's best work, although the entire cast is truly brilliant. excellent production values as you would expect from a show with an a-list cast. addresses important issues of our time.",10
"One of the best dramas ever!","The Morning Show is one of the best dramas ever on television. The cast is incredible, even the small parts are played by amazing, well known actors. The latest season focuses on Cory's character, which was great, as he is one of my favourite characters. Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Anniston give Emma-worthy performances in all of the seasons. The show deals with current issues without becoming too preachy or one-sided. I don't know much about behind-the-scenes television, but The Morning Show seems plausible to me. The latest season definitely left the door open for another season, so fingers crossed!",9
"A contrived ending undermines an otherwise exhilarating ride","This show had me hooked, and had all the makings of a great show - likeable and despicable characters, intrigue, depth, tension. Such a shame then that instead of keeping the main character consistent, ending with a cliffhanger and holding tension they went for a sudden and unexplained change in the character for the sake of a clean, neat ending that one suspects may be purely for the sake of delivering a clear political message. Rather than pulling me to my knees begging for the second season, I'm left shaking my head wondering at what could have been! I suppose the majority of the season is still enjoyable.",6
"Very interesting show","I loved it and waiting for the second season.I loved it when Jennifer real appeared in the last episode, she is amazing.",9
"Solid show; rich and thought-provoking, but not sure about the ending.","I enjoyed it overall.It feels like a lot of thought and care has gone into the craft of it. Performances are very solid across the board. It navigates our current times in a fascinating way, treating the #MeToo movement as complex subject matter. The show provides multiple opinions and perspectives, prompting the audience to consider how they feel about what is on screen. It asks challenging, yet stimulating, questions about truth, honesty, ethics and integrity.As for things I didn't like, it can feel very overly dramatic at times, and some of the performances could really be toned down. Additionally, it's quite muddy as to what the Steve Carell character actually got up to. In asking such difficult questions about workplace harassment and how to deal with it, I still feel like I don't have a clear picture of what happened, which really throws off my ability to reach a judgement on this character, as it feels like the show is asking me to do. So much of the show rests on this.Then we have the ending (which I won't spoil). I felt as though the finale went against the broad spectrum of perspectives that had been explored earlier, instead leaning towards very obviously preaching one message. The end was very abrupt; quite rushed, with no falling tension. I felt like I didn't have time to process all that went on. This is a 10-hour long story, with a sprawling network of characters; so much momentum is built up along the 10 episodes, and I felt like slamming on the brakes in the last few minutes of the finale wasn't appropriate. It could've really done with a feature-length final episode, or potentially another episode entirely. Not only would this have evened the pace and allowed plenty of time for things to settle after the climax, but it could also have provided more time to explore the characters' different perspectives about the actions in the finale, making the ending more nuanced and multi-faceted. Instead, they end by delivering a very defined message to the audience, allowing for no 'falling tension'.Sometimes it feels like the last few episodes were written by a different person/people than the previous episodes, with a slightly jarring change in direction. Still, I liked 'The Morning Show', and would recommend it.",7
"Too many dark scenes","Many times during the episodes it gets so dark the screen is mostly black for extended periods of time plus whenever someone sends a text or reads on we can't see what it says either because the shot of the cellphone goes by to quickly or the message is simply unreadable to the viewing audience. Why can't the text message be in the closed captions.",5
"Jennifer Aniston at her best, Reece a force of nature","Jennifer has some incredible development fairly quickly and Reece remains steadfast in ideals many people strive for. The supporting cast is incredible and the writing on point. I hope this show wins many awards.",10
"I guess I have to give this a 10...","How I have to review this series. Apple+ i got for a free trial with a new apple product. Its not worth paying for...it like pay 5 bucks a month for the ability to buy some other stuff it hardly offers anything its rent or buy on everything you click on. So anyway in this quarantined life i needed something to spend my time with to kill an hour or so...well...I did six episodes in one sitting and the other 4 the next day. The show was fantastic, it gave portrait of just how complicated these things are. It was just fantastic, I have not seen anything like this in a long long time.
I did not have any background on it i saw Jennifer, Reese, and Steve as stars though oh a sweet mindless comedy and I enjoy comedies so I will watch. And it took me by storm.
I am not a Jennifer Aniston fan as far as being a great actress. Her character Rachel Green was so terrible it made me want to vomit. I had to set through many episodes of Friends just because it was supposedly the best show on TV (sorry not in my opinion) and everyone i knew had to stop everything and watch it. I still don't know if i would call her a great actress. I mean like Bette Davis, Glenn Close, Cate Blanchett, Jane Fonda - type real wonderful actresses. But she is entertaining,,,,she just has one thing she does well Rachel/Jennifer that is it but it was perfect for Alex. Don't get me wrong Jennifer is wonderfully entertaining which is what we usually want from someone presenting entertainment.
But anyway this was so incredible. I have always despised those morning foolish news shows with Hoda - Jenna- Gayle Kathy Lee- and the such. Even more so now we have had this pandemic and supposedly only essential workers were to were. But this was inexcusable, these were not essential in any means. So this series shows just how it is.
It was perfect..It was entertaining it was exciting.. it let me feel good that others understand that there is a lot more to the this topic, that people do not want to talk about.",10
"An atom bomb","Stories of some shows are better left unsaid.You should see episode 1 to 9 just to get shock from episode 10. It's like they made a bomb slowly & steadily and then in episode 10 they just dropped it!Can't say more because I am still trembling and shaking from the shock of the bomb!",9
"Best show on TV hands down","I bow to Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell, comma and Billy Crudup!The best writing, the best acting I have seen in many many years.If you have a chance to watch this series do it you will not regret it.",10
"Superb show from a cynic writing their first ever online review of anything","Truly excellent show. Completely believable performances, and brilliantly honest portrayal of the Machiavellian processes of bigTV businesses and big star egos; I've been there and I know. Engaging and real yet manages to create suspense and realistic plot twists. Brilliant.",10
"First rate scripting and acting","I'm four episodes in and each one has impressed me with the quality of the writing, plot and pacing. In addition to this the acting is as good as it gets.I always thought Jennifer Aniston was really good as an actress, over and above her obvious presentability. She was great in The Good Girl where she showed her acting chops but here, as a more mature figure, she really has that thing where she owns the screen. Like Jon Voight does in Ray Donovan.There are no wasted moments and the show is captivating. I especially love the engagement with difficult arguments such as sexual harassment and abortion, There are two sides to a story and this show explores both, effortlessly slipping from one side to the other.The cast is also great, as is all else about this show. I'm only four episodes in but congratulations to the team behind this.",8
"Linear boadcast","Unfortunately, only a linear broadcast of the episodes.",6
"What A Show!!!","Only gave it a shot because of the strong cast. Wasn't thrilled about the subject matter. Thought I'd watch the pilot and never get back to it, WRONG!!! Binged it within 72hours.One of the best television series out there. Strong performances by almost everybody. Billy Crudup is a hoot!The Morning Show is powerful and worth a watch!",10
"Timely if a bit ham-fisted.","While there are some great moments, there is nothing really new here. The subject matter is prescient and important, but the execution often tends to be predictable. There is very little nuance in the exploration of the issues, and the characters are broadly drawn. A bevy of tried techniques keeps the viewer engaged ep-to-ep with some exceptional talent behind and in front of the camera, however it does feel like a missed opportunity, overblown and preachy.",6
"Meh","Awesome cast, but plot is weak. Season 1 is much better than season 2 but still not amazing. I watched a few episodes of season 2 and have no need to finish it which is very rare for me to not finish a show no matter how bad it is. Steve Carrell is wasted in this role which is a bummer.",5
"Brilliant!","This is THE best TV I've watched in a long time! Jennifer is the best she has been since Friends. I watched it, told hubby about it and he thought it was amazing too.",10
"Similar to The Newsroom","Saw two episodes and I really like it. A big part of the show is a comment on journalism. Do you produce fluff pieces for ratings or do you report real stories.",9
"It's amazing","A wonderful and interesting series Representatives are very beautiful and excellent writing and exciting events is one of the best series of the year",9
"Amazingly addictive show. A gem.","Billy Crudup steals the show. He is the spoon that stirs the pot. I read another review that mentioned him and that was spot on. And Jennifer Aniston is her usually great self along with Steve Carrell as the Matt Lauer character who fell from grace as the Morning Show's former co anchor.",10
"Awesome!!","This series is TV at its very best! The acting is flawless, (Gugu Mbatha-Raw is amazing!!), the script is tight, the story is fascinating, and it's all so relevant today, on several different levels.
Starts off a bit slow (for me), but stick with it, as it gets deeper and more intense, and descends into places rarely covered in TV.
Well done Apple TV for such an awesome and well made series, which really has something to say!!",10
"OUTSTANDING!","I happened across this series after getting Apple TV+ free with a new phone. I had a vague recollection of it receiving good reviews, but I probably judged it by the title alone and didn't think it would be for me - how wrong was I!?
I was pretty much addicted from the off. The character portrayal is superb! You can't help but like every character (or at least elements of), apart from one, even though they are all self-serving in some way. The acting and dialogue is captivating. I loved Crudup's character! This show is funny when you least expect it and the last two episodes were an absolute emotional rollercoaster. I can't recommend this enough (it's totally worth paying for Apple TV+ or binge watching in the 7 day free trial ;-)) and I'm so glad they are doing another series!",10
"Not bad","The show itself is not bad. The acting is good. But the objective here is to try to boost up morning TV. They make sure they hit every news event in the last decade. They try to portray that they are serious news. So in that sense, they failed. Many think that this is serious show, and should believe it as a portrayal of morning TV. Morning TV is brain dead for housewives sitting at home all day. So this show fails at realism.",7
"A positive surprise","I only started watching because Adam Savage praised it on his YouTube channel. But honestly, a serious drama show with Jennifer Aniston (my least favourite FRIENDS actor) in a leading role and about a typical morning TV show (probably the worst kind of TV after reality TV in my book)?? The premise didn't look good but The King of Geeks loved it, so I gave it a shot. And couldn't let it go until done with the currently released episodes (ep1-4).In a time where the public forums seem to be saturated by this insane trench war of what political values should control the common narrative, it's a pleasure to come across a show that seems more interested in exploring the complicated, nuanced truth than to satisfy any of the simplified before-mentioned narratives. So far (ep1-4) The Morning Show is one such show. This is obviously not very satisfying for anyone seeking conformation of their own values and ideas, so if you one of those - just move along and ignore this show. It definitely not a coincidence that Reese Whitherspoons character in the show identifies herself as neither left nor right politically.The overall story is simple enough (so far): An honest and ""true"" country girl comes in and changes the face of a morning TV show ruffling the feathers of the establishment (-ish), but that's hardly what it's really about. The main subject is really about the complications of sexual behaviour and relationships in such a work environment and the many-faceted consequences of this. And instead of handing out a simple view of perpetrators vs. victims it manages to look at the subject from many different angles. It's about humans - not about certain political narratives. As already indicated, the writing is intelligent and nuanced, the acting is great (I love Anistons performance), and production quality is also very good.",8
"First Season was great!","Loved the first season and the final episode was amazing. I would compare it to the final episode for the first season of Big Little Lies as far as the feeling like it couldn't have ended any better. The second season was ok but nothing like the first.",7
"Oh dear. Season 2","No idea what happened here. S1 was decent, not amazing but pretty good. S2 on the other hand, they've completely thrown it all out. Characters have changed personality, plot has gone, the lot. Great characters like Mitch, have turned into 1dimensional jelly.The whole woke agenda in S2 is so over-blown, it's shouted so loud, so in your face you wonder if there's going to be some amazing twist about it all. It's way over the top, most recently with the line ""I'm sick of mediocre white-men"". I can't figure out if the show is trying to be clever and has something up it's sleeve or if it really is just trying to be as offensive as possible. Trouble is, it's so un-subtle, so heavy handed I can't see how it can be part of a wider plot.I just don't know where it's going with any of it. It's all a bit of a mess really.",3
"Interesting Premise, Great Cast","I'm liking this show, particularly the interplay between cast members. Jennifer Aniston's character keeps on talking about needing 'Chemistry' with her co-anchor, but I'm liking the Chemistry between her, Reese Witherspoon, and the other leads. I like the premise (inexperienced-but-interesting female co-anchor replaces long time male anchor who was rightfully ""me-tooed""). A number of interesting sub-plots look like they will be mined for interesting developments in the future.I'm not sure that this is 'great' television, but I found it intriguing enough to sign up for AppleTV+. I am amazed though, at some of the low rankings, primarily from individuals who don't like the show's 'politics'. I watch plenty of shows in which I don't like the viewpoint of the characters, but that doesn't stop me from liking the drama, suspense and/or action that results.",8
"Smart","Day's of Hollywood are coming to an end. It's sad to see but viewers have been in search for smart movies and Apple sure has done that with this new show. I loved everything about it. The acting is at an all time high, the writing is super smart, and the pase is perfect. My only complaint is that I wish Apple would just release the full season instead of making us wait with only one show a week. But I purchased the subscription just for this show so maybe they are doing it this way to get viewers and keep them ;)",9
"Very good acting and dramaturgy","I appreciate so much the acting of both main protagonists. Especially Jennifer acts believable. The dramaturgy is also well done. That's why I wanted to see all of the episodes one after another. The story is very good too.I think it's important to show some critical views of journalistic work as well to understand a part of the context of it.I think in this times with a few of narcissistic politicians it's necessary to appreciate a good journalism to know what we should protect and save.",9
"Personally Inspiring and a Boost for Females in the Workplace","Reese Witherspoon is charming and inspiring as a reporter who wants people to know the brutal truth. Jennifer Aniston grabs a strong hold and performance on how women should approach the movement moving forward.Outstanding supporting roles by Billy Crudup, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and Mark Duplass. Martin Short makes an appearance in Episode 4.",10
"Just press play","After just ten episodes The Morning Show has managed to nab its spot as number one on my favourite TV shows of all time. I cannot say enough good things about this show. From the title theme to the tension between characters, to me it is as perfect as any show can get. I honestly have never cared so much at how individual characters may react to one another, thinking how their actions may come across to each other. With such a deep topic this show really highlights struggles we have in our own lives, showing the point of view from every aspect and person. I really don't understand some of the negative press this show has received. It needs to be watched by as many people as possible, to bring up the topic in conversation to every breakfast, lunch and dinner table. Not to mention the incredible acting from all main and supporting actors and actresses. I can't say one actor steals the show because they are ALL incredible. I was on the edge of my seat every episode. An instant 10/10.",10
"We're binge-watching this is so great!","It's Feb 2022, and we're watching this series for the first time. It's addictive! The writing is outstanding with all the twists and turns. Jennifer and Reese are well matched and do a great job, as do many of the cast. Some serious topics, for sure, and topical. Looking forward to the 3rd season.",10
"Woah!","So, I don't know what took me so long, but it's literally one month away from season 2 (being it's August 2021 RN) and I just started watching season one yesterday. I found that once I started it I couldn't turn it off. I don't know if I didn't watch before because it b/c of the triggers, or b/c it was staring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, but GD is it good. I also was a little hesitant watching it seeing as how I was with completely obsessed the HBO show 'the newsroom' & I thought this show could never be as well made as that one, but honestly this show comes pretty close to that level of sophistication, and I'm shocked & happily surprised. I mean I was one of the people who did watch Matt Lauer every day on the morning for a number of years, so I guess on some level it's very real, and while the way that they portray some of the characters are at times frustrating- they are also very well thought out, and flawed & I applaud them for that. The show really is surprisingly clever & raw in a number of ways, and I really didn't know what to expect, but I did not expect it to so intelligently written. Kudos to Apple + for the show. I mean really great work. I just got through with the California wildfire episode, and the way they used the fire destruction as symbolism for what's going on with each character on the show was really impressive. I did not expect this level of quality. I can't wait for season two. P. S., I wonder what Matt Lauer is doing these days? I'm about to go down to google hole.",10
"THAT WIG!!","In the year 2020-2021, I would seriously think that someone could have come up with a better wig for one of the leading actors (not to mention Reese Witherspoon is also one of the many producers)! It is totally DISTRACTING and resembles a dead deer pelt plopped on top of her head. Jennifer Anniston's hairstylist is obviously working to create another signature hairstyle for her so what could be the reason for the sloppy wig dropped on top of Witherspoon's head!?",7
"Jennifer Aniston plays Jennifer Aniston","I finished the entire first season because Jennifer Aniston plays this narcissistic self aggrandizing nutjob who only cares about herself. Some reviews say that this is her best role yet. It's not surprising if you get to play yourself.It was hard for me to separate Rachel (Friends) from Alex.It's not a very memorable show. There are however some good things about this show. I love the character Cory Elisson portrayed by Billy Crudup. Great actor! Also liked what Marcia Gay Hard added to the equation. Very convincing acting.It's an ""okay-ish"" show. It's not that bad but it's not great either.Not sure if I'm going to watch season 2.3 stars. 2 for Billy and Marcia and 1 for some of the great camerawork.",3
"Awesome Great Fantastic!","Been a while since I've seen a TV Series so well written, directed and performed. Cant fault this at all! 100% quality.",10
"Yes, #Youtoo","Great story to realize the different forms of sexual harassment and its diverse points of view. The casting is amazing and the script is unpredictable. Wonderful show. Maybe Reese is not the best choose for her character, but, Who cares, she is amazing!",9
"Loved the first season!!","For me this is one of the best series I've seen in a while. The way we get to experience not only the perspective of the victim, but also the attacker and his friends. To feel all the confusion on Mitch because he didn't know what he did wrong and having the explanation. It moved me.
Jennifer Aniston did a great performance!!! I've never seen her on such serious role and it was perfect. She captures Alex essence perfectly.
The soundtrack is perfect. The music on the last episode is great.
Episode 8 was my favorite.",10
"Best show on Apple TV","I've watched the whole series twice, its a very topical subject of mans manipulation over woman in the work place, did he? Didnt he?The performances of Carrell, Aniston and Weatherspoon are beyond sublime, the true gritty nature of whats happening never being too far from the comedy, its funny and very serious all at the same time. The show has some real puppet master antics afoot all the way through and this will ultimately prove to be a defining moment in 20s TV shows, you know that this is only going to get better, you also know its a touch above your usual made for streaming offer.",10
"Wow from someone who avoids seriea","I detest series so much time for a movie so many segments too much space for characters... But this one is in cre di ble the plot the Development of the characters the story the acting all is to perfection. Acting is stellar cheers to Jennifer Aniston. I regret I already watched it.",10
"Binge this!","Great show. Apple + has come out with some very good series. I don't know what streaming service matches these series. The morning show is another one where it's star studded but no one lets down one bit. Reese Witherspoon is the sassy new anchor that fills in for Steve Carell. Jennifer Aniston is amazing as well as Billy Crudup. Definitely recommend this.",9
"Between the forced, the willing and the maleficient","On the one hand, we want to empower the weaker one. We say do away with barriers. Let there be no fences between the bosses and subordinates. There should be no discrimination between the sexes. At the same time, we realise that hormones rage high in the spring of youth, at a time when everybody wants to set the right footing for their future. The race to perch at the higher branches has become increasingly difficult. The juicy fruits hanging at the top are so luring. Everyone wants to catch a glimpse from the coveted crown of the food chain.Everyone can give their time, dedication and knowledge towards this end. When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Players have to dig deep into their bags to confer something quite primal to achieve their goals. What is wrong in a little flirting or exchanging little bodily fluids, they would justify, especially when they look at the bigger picture. Mission accomplished, and everybody is happy.People in positions of power, on the other hand, may use it as a bargaining tool to dangle their carrots.If it is a win-win situation, why would anyone complain? Are they the sore losers who got conned into an unwilling arrangement? Were they helpless as they overcome by pressures to conform by people in authority? Was there regret? Was there a morning-after self-realisation? Was there ill intent to humiliate? Was it all a well-planned plot to dethrone? Did the juices turn sour?Humans being social animals, with continual contact with co-workers or bosses, may be attracted to one another over time. The question is whether this liaison is going to affect their work. No one is a saint and life is not fair.That is why it is tricky to deal with the #metoo complains. Sometimes it is the people in power who use their positions to obtain sexual gratifications. At other times, it is vindication on the part of the victim or alleged victims.In a hurried environment of datelines and inflated ego, internal investigations try to portray a safe working environment for the public to see. Beneath all these, this is a compulsion by a few to expose the toxic culture that is happening in the station.Not only the main stars performed well. Even the supporting actors gave their best to re-create what seems like an attempt to showcase what Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby did to the movie industry.",7
"Fantastic acting","I love this series - Love the scrip as well as the acting 🤗",8
"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed is king","Between so many recent shows, games and other media, this is the one that actually has some merit.The agenda it's pushing is still visible.. But at least not so blatant.",7
"Classic nosedive","First season was a solid fast-paced involving melodrama. Second season is a major snoozefest. Lots of headless chicken action amounting to nothing much.",4
"I was hooked..... 15 min into the 1st episode!!!","What a great start to the show!! A great drama series after a long time. It's such a pleasure to watch complex female characters played by the phenomenal Jennifer and Reese. It's amazing to watch Jennifer in this meaty role.... Steve Carell as always is a delight to watch.... Can't wait to see how this story unfolds. 2 thumbs up!!!",9
"What a Triumph for Apple TV+","Honestly, I think Apple TV has started off with a bang with The Morning Show. Along with the powerhouse and star-studded cast, this show is raw and emotional. It perfectly showcases the world of entertainment and broadcasting through the lens of sexual misconduct. It brings to life the #metoo movement with real world implications. Overall, I was very impressed with this show, and it gives me a reason to keep my Apple TV subscription.",10
"Wow","The performance of Aniston's career. Loved every second of it. Plus, music and shots on point.",10
"Great show","This show is powerful. It speaks the truth of every working women. I personally relate to this. It well written and everything was perfect.",10
"Morning News ?","Awesome, a shining beacon on what morning news shows actually are, "" entertainment for the for the brain dead masses. ""Except Michael Strahan, a shining light of Truth.",10
"Needs more humor... off to a revealing start!","... and Reese needs to revert back to blond. Fit it in. Pronto. Three, maybe, more comedic actors with strong drama skills should never go to waste for any dramatic agenda. Use them well. Series is stylish, real, human, and it cares. It shows us what all goes on while we are sleeping, muddling through our own daily lives. I've tremendous respect for those who do this, operate buses, planes, subways, deliver food, and so on... a very long list, that we have grown compliant with. I like that it's trying to show us they are human with lives, troubles, pressures, scrutinty and family lives they juggle just like us to keep us on top of topics sometimes as close to them as to us. Just amp up the humor... that's a part of life too. Like the lyrics say, laughing and crying, you know, it's the same release...",10
"Did I miss a scene?","Great acting, good script but, the whole premise falls flat on its face when ""the incident"" that is supposed to be a rape, isn't anywhere close to being a rape. I understand that the scene is supposed to depict a woman freezing up but none of that shows. She speaks, responds and from the viewers perspective makes an active choice to go ahead with it. No violence, no coercion, nothing. And all of a sudden Steve Carells character is supposed to be a sexual predator.",6
"Beautifully made with great style! (deserves an Oscar)","This show is just pristine! The way they film, the dialogue, the cast, scenes... it's so beautifully made and always involving great emotion and character. Deserves an Oscar, truly! Jennifer and Reese, they incorporate the most delicate topics that nowadays are so tough to talk about, and they do it with style!!! There is always so much emotion going on and you can see that the actor/actress is giving their best and trying to portray as truly as they can! The entire cast and production is amazing! Really!!!! I gave 8 stars for season 1, but for season 2, I'm giving 10 stars.Ps: always watch the behind the scenes at the last 2:50 min from the show. So worth it.",10
"Surprised","This is a good tv soap with great performances from the main characters. In a way, the dramatic scenes with Reese Witherspoon is engaging. She really holds the show the center of the drama in the first season. Jennifer Anniston pulls out all the verve to bring this conceited self centered character Alex. Steve Carrel spins his soloquues as the master actor/comedian that he is as he plays with a middle age crisis . The ensemble is creative and the passion moves in this show. I hope it continues to evolve its characters and add to the exposure of power and mis use of power of the media. At times its melodramatic and pretentiously espousing as a woke show. New characters can keep this series going, cheers.",7
"well season 2 is a bore","There really is nothing going on.But okay I gotta edit my previous review tho. Turned out, it's worse as i watch it further.Just a bunch of people talking about a bunch of ""relatable"" stuff with no real impact to the story as a few coherent scenes of uninteresting aftermath are scattered throughout 10 episodes that is stretched so thin and it is getting ridiculous.Like that argument between Bradley and her brother, what is that even about? She's distant from her mom, she had an abortion in the 90's? Her mom upon hearing Bradley is gay is then wondering if she dates girls how could she got pregnant? REALLY? And then the brother was like, this isn't a good time for me for you to be gay because I'm being an addict right now??? And then they argued that Bradley thinks people are progressive now but then the brother said if Bradley thinks her hometown is progressive why in the closet for so long then Bradley said she wasn't coming out she was outed????WHAT THE HELL??? How is that even a conflict? That doesn't even make any sense. What are we supposed to take from that? Bradley wanted to remain in the closet?Then Bradley was like, GO TO REHAB, YOU IDIOT! Then he said, no, it's expensive and wouldn't accept Bradley paying for it??? So he'd rather Bradley just not be gay for now and cater to his junky brother? And then when Cory came the brother was like.. sure talk to him, he's the one that's important to you... OH MY GOD! That's her boss, you dumbass. What a clueless retard. No one is that stupid.And the so self importance for nor reason when they heard Mitch died and they were urgently panic like going from news room to offices and so on... delivering the news whispering??? WHY???Why the Italian reporter trying to confirm Mitch's death to UBA? They fired his ass a long time ago.Why everyone at UBA was like OMG this is so shocking... WHO CARES? Well we, the audience care, we follow his trip to Italy but that doesn't concerns UBA???And wtf is with the urgency to find Alex to deliver the news about Mitch's death?Even the writers were self aware that they included the scene when Stella asked Cory if it is a good idea for Alex to deliver the news and Cory was like OMG OMG of course doh....BUT WHY?????The dude is no longer urgent to the company. What makes his death urgent to the company?And even more bizarre they suddenly in this some kind of race with time to figure out if it's true or not.?WHO CARES!Well we do but UBA doesn't as far as their concerns, Mitch can join the goddamn cabaret and start a career as a rapper for all we care and it wouldn't make a difference to them.OH MY GOD WHAT A MESS.",4
"WHY .. WHY .. WHY ?","What is wrong with people watching this show, or any show for that matter?I´m talking about the folks that hate this show and now are asking Apple+ to not do a season 3 ?Every person has the ability to turn off the tv, telephone og tablet if there is something they dont like .. no one is forced to see anything and there are so many things these people should watch instead !!I loved this show, acting was brilliant and I realy loved Bradley and Laura
Now my hope is that we get another season, if by any chance I wont like it, then I will just shut it off, not ask for it to be shut down ..
Thanks for a great show :)",10
"AMAZING BUT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BEST!","I WISH HBO COULD HAVE MADE THIS SHOW INSTEAD OF APPLE TV. THIS SHOW IS STILL AMAZING AND WORTH THE WATCH THE WRITING IS TOP NOTCH AND THE MAIN CAST IS AMAZING BUT THE PRODUCTION DOESN'T MATCH THE STANDARDS OF GREAT NEWS SERIES LIKE SUCCESION. I REALLY WISH HBO MADE THIS SHOW AS EVERYBODY IN THE PLANET KNOWS THEY HAVE THE BEST PRODUCTION STUDIOS. Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon both are treat to watch also the Steve Carell is excellent as always. Story wises this show is on par with the SUCCESSION, even though I know the Succession is family centered show, but the production is very very good. This show lacks in the production which limit its success.",8
"Love it!","Awesome performance of Jennifer and Reese. Very interesting story / character development after the first 3 episodes.",9
"Compelling","This is fictional but inspired but true events and beings to light the male dominated culture that takes advantage of women. Brilliant!",9
"WOW WOW WOW","This series BLEW MY MIND! It's not often I am glued to something and I sure was with this series. A bold look into corporate corruption at the highest levels. Sadly I have not really seen anything come to light in real time about this kind of thing but what a great show. Jen and Reece, you rock x",10
"Just bloody amazing","I started to watch episode one season one, I thought meh.... But I gave it a hard go! I binge watched season 1; by crikey it's brilliant, really cleverly written and directed. I can see why it is Emmy Winning!Jenifer Anniston & Reese Witherspoon are superbly cast and play their characters so superbly that they are 100% believable. I must say that all cast members are brilliant and their acting is just natural and easy, the sets are awesome, the lighting, and camera work is sublime.I have just started season two, it hits the floor running very fast, picking up just after season one left off.I refuse to ever put spoilers, just to say if you want a drama that is full of American back stabbing and Steve Carrell, Billy Crudup and Mark Duplass as part of a stellar cast. Go for it.",10
"To understand what is happening","There are books, films or TV series than can help to understand the times we are living in now.
There is so much going on on the media networks and in everyday life, regarding the struggle to gain it or exercise it abolishing women.The series is a good remainder of what is happening.Well written and produce it. I enjoy it until now and looking forward to see next chapters.",10
"Beats Scarface","Great plot and great cast. Get ready though. This show has more F Bombs than Scarface. Wow! So many that it should be listed as a cast member.",7
"Great season 1 - downhill from there","The Morning Show began its journey as a fresh and unapologetically candid drama that offered viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the high-stakes world of morning television. Season one was praised for its sharp-witted and subversive take on the subject, particularly for its handling of sexual harassment in the workplace, anchored by what many considered to be one of Jennifer Aniston's best performances.However, as the series progressed, it seemed to struggle with maintaining the originality and critical edge that set it apart initially. By its third season, ""The Morning Show"" appeared to have embraced its identity as a borderline camp workplace soap. Critics noted that it became highly watchable despite, or perhaps because of, its defiance of good sense. The show's narrative began to lean heavily on clichés and contemporary political trends, which some viewers felt detracted from the complexity and nuance that the first season promised.In essence, while ""The Morning Show"" started off as a promising and thought-provoking series, it seems to have lost some of its initial luster, opting instead for a more formulaic approach that resonates less with the critical acclaim it once received.",5
"Two great women!","Both are Executive Producers of this new series. I hope it stays on point facing current issues, shining a light on hitherto dark places. Anniston's performances so far are stellar. Witherspoon is completely believable as we watch her wrestle with her own truth and how to honor that.Definitely does not disappoint!UPDATE 12/20/2019: While this may be a TV show, it has it's roots deeply buried in the truth of our corporate culture. I am 71 now, but was subjected to the issues raised in this series. I applaud Reese and Jennifer for their attempt to address the secrets so well-guarded by ""the club.""",10
"Amazing!!! Must watch","You would think this show with so many big stars would maybe be a bit twee and by the 2nd episode you would be switching off ... but I was so wrong. What you get is a superb storyline that is current, incredible acting from everyone and characters you believe it. The writing is above what I expected and the character played by Billy Crudup has the best one liners. Episode 10, is far the best episode and I literally felt emotional watching it and at the end I felt I could breathe. Superb show awards all round.",10
"Wow, Amazing Acting!","We all love Jennifer Aniston dramatic role in Cake (where she was totally snubbed for Oscar) and I have personally been waiting for another great dramatic performance of her. After a few bad comedy movies later, she comes back to remind us what a great actress she is with her portrayal of Alex Levy in The Morning Show. Along with the amazing Reese Witherspoon, both are successfully playing characters of two complicated strong women with two completely different personalities that make us love and hate them at the same time.
The show tells us about the dynamics of what happens behind the scene of the morning show and boy it is very exciting and complicated in a good way. Season 1 (up to episode 5) is still sticking with one main storyline, which is good as we slowly learn about each individual character and get more and more invested to it.",9
"Excellent","This series was long Over Do! Thank You to The Producers, Writers, Actors and Actresses etc... for an amazing two series. I hope Apple TV continues this series for All us Viewers. What an amazing job they have done bringing such a core revelation to TV!!",10
"Impressively accurate reflection of reality","Impressively accurate reflection of reality related to current topics of life in America (and not only). Excellent acting on every level - Steve Carell, Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon handle the characters impressively. It's been a long time since I watched a drama series this good. I am looking forward to the new season and I hope that this time it will be about a current topic from reality in America. I'm guessing it will be about past or upcoming presidential elections or something like THE GOOD FIGHT. But it wasn't just because of this series that I became an Apple subscriber - the Foundation is simply unbeatable, I also highly recommend it!",10
"Amazing","I watched the entire season In 2 days. It's brilliant. Great performances amazing actors.",10
"Ah, this hair...","Amazing show! 10 episodes overnight! But...one thing stuck in my head...why this hair, Reese, why??? A perfect show, glamorous Jennifer Aniston, luxiorous and sassy, perfect look, hair, makeup, outfit....and this awful wig on Reese's head (I love her otherwise) is the thing I think about while watching... Something was not right with her looks! The same feeling I had watching Julia Roberts in Homecoming! You would think hair is not such a difficult thing to make up, right?",8
"Season 2 is a showstopper","By midway Season 1, I began to question my conscience as to why I had never watched an episode of Friends nor seen any Reece Witherspoon movie. This was a 9/10 series.The 'Me too' storyline was presented so well, particularly in the way the simplest of facts can be twisted and distorted to misrepresent truth and adverse the innocent.Midway Episode 3, Season 2, my conscience was vindicated. To me, pity that the benchmark achieved in Season 1 could not have been bettered, or equaled, rather than drift and drift to where I felt it was going nowhere. Too agonising for me to watch any further and had to give up at that point.",5
"Well done","So we'll paced, great acting and I'm surprised by Aniston. Incredible screenplay. I hope it continues to be this good and they don't ruin it for the remaining episodes.",8
"The best writing ever!","The is new show kept my attention the entire time. Matt Lauer? The best TV writing I've seen in many years. Beautifully done! Again, all the actors to the production crew. PERFECT! Excellent work. I'm smiling from ear to ear for all of you. THAT'S how you make a good show. Hurry season 2!",10
"Love this show!!","Episode by episode I get more drawn into the story and the complexity of the characters. It's fantastic!!",9
"Reflection on me too today","First it is amazing how Reese Witherspoon can still look like a 25 ish woman (not sure what age she is meant to be but I'm guessing) when she is 43. It is also really nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a role other than rom com's. There is a big female cast in this film. Not sure how realistic that is for the industry but it is nice for the film. Of course it is necessary that the big executives are men. Neither of which you want to trust but for different reasons. They are both sexists and ageists but not sure that was even done deliberately, it feels like it is a by product of their position. Can a man in that position, that has been in that position or similar for some years, not be at least ageist? For them they see youth as a necessary to attract viewers and thetefore money. Mainly young women that is. Are they that wrong? If they are right, is it ageism? But that isn't the main reflection point.
Me too! The show Centers around the male anchor of the morning show being fired for sexual misconduct. He claims he is innocent, that yes he had a few extra marital affairs with various assistants and such but they were all consensual. What I find very interesting in this show is the nuances of what the different players see as acceptable and what is or isn't a sexual misconduct. It isn't always spelled out but it is clear the the man accused is not blind to me too and is certainly sympathetic to the movement but does not consider that he has his place among the other men. He is not a rapist he says at one point. He also makes the difference between him and another man who has also been accused who he clearly calls out to be a sexual predictor. So what has he done? Has he committed sexual misconduct? In the penultimate episode we hear the story of one of the ""victims"". This is where it becomes interesting. This is where each can judge if they consider him guilty or not. Me too clearly has. The show clearly has. I say that without having seen the ladt episode so my view may also change after that but this is at this point in time. Me? Not so sure. She clearly say how she enjoyed it. For me this is the big difference between a misconduct and a consensual relationship. If she enjoyed it and showed that she enjoyed it. The man cannot guess that she has changed her mind if she does not change her attitude or say anything. If she felt ashamed for her actions with him and thought that people were looking at her and judging her that was her issue not his. If from the beginning she said she felt uncomfortable or that very quickly she stopped flirting with him it would be different but she basically had a huge crush on the star. Started to get distracted because she was thinking of him all the time and didn't know if she wanted to go further. Went further than her prude nature would normally go and regretted it. Instead of facing her own responsibilities in the situation she jumped on the me too movement that makes it really easy now. But that is my view.
As for the other case. She said herself they both wanted it. At the time she didnt feel any pressure. There was no consequences for her leaving him. Again if me too had never happened, this women would never had thought twice about that relationship again. If were real misconduct he would have gotten her fired or moved to a different show. So unless there is a big revelation in the ladt episode I'm saying this is a prime exemple where me too is used for the wrong reasons. FYI I am a woman. 37.",8
"Ends much better than it began","The show grows more and more sophisticated and they did a great job with all the corporate intrigues, the schemes, the double-crossing. The finale was just incredibly grand and the chemistry between Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon was impeccable. Steve Carell also turns out to be good at drama!",8
"Addictive","This is heroine in digital form.One can deconstruct a show or you can inform on the effect it has on oneself.If this was big candy box if eat the whole box thinking just one more bite.",9
"10/10","Love this show. Binge watched the first 3 episodes and realised I had to wait for episode 4!Great actors, good for them tackling this storyline...... intrigued to see where it's heading?",10
"Season 3, episode 5","All I can say is, WTF. Haven't we had enough of COVID and how it totally screwed our lives. Don't watch this episode if you don't want to feel that sickening restrictive, life sucking feeling that COVID caused. This episode in my estimation was a lazy attempt to build an episode out of nothing but the cutting room floor scraps. I may not return to watching the rest of this series I am so disappointed. The producers should be embarrassed by this pathetic attempt. Next time you don't have material that pushes the story forward, just take a break. This would have been better left on the cutting room floor.",1
"Very Powerful Show!","Amazing plot! Hats off to whole team!The show has expressed so many feelings and practicality of life. If you don't want to suffer, then just say it and change the situation. Stop thinking about judgemental people. It's okay to be impulsive as long as you own your actions.",10
"The best drama show in a while","It made me on my edge every second of every episode",10
"Passed the smell test.","I love this show. So glad to see Jennifer back on television. She is one of my favorite actresses. Jennifer and Reese play off each other so well, they have perfect chemistry. This is a well scripted series. I am glad to see that this is a drama series and not a comedy series which these two ladies are good at also. I usually watch 4 episodes before I leave a review and this one passed...I hope it stays in the momentum that it is in. I have put this one on my must watch tv list...",8
"Amazing start for a new streaming service","This show is exceptional.I think a lot of people saw who was in the cast and assumed it was going to be a light silly comedy. With Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carrol that is an easy assumption to make. Wrong. This is a drama.I have never seen Jennifer in anything that I thought she did better. She brings a lot to the screen. I never would have guessed she could play a role like this so convincingly.Now, after watching the first 3 episodes I am forced to wait until the next batch of shows are available to stream next week.",9
"Excellent show!","I don't know what's better, the acting or the writing. Hands down, this show is awesome!! I think this is Jennifer Aniston's best work.In addition to the amazing actors, this show has twists and turns that one can't predict. That makes this show riveting. The writers are very creative and show the drama that occurs behind the scenes of a news network. Watching TMS, makes one think about the dog eat dog world we live in; the constant ruthlessness and competition amongst people, and so much more.The photography/videography is also incredible, better than most shows out there. Even the music is perfect!! I highly recommend TMS. I'm so glad I started watching it. It didn't take me long to binge this, thus far. Of course, now I can't wait for the next episode. Great show!",10
"Amazing","Amazing , I am waiting for the continue of the story!!!",10
"Two details of Season 2","First of all, I think it is a truth that to leaving wuhan, saying 'working for UBA(a foreign news institution) is moe helpful and useful than saying 'my mother is dying in Beijing'. Second, I have a doubt that why the EQ and IQ of Cory in season 2 lower so much than that in season 1. In season 1, Cory is so calm, smart, charming and insightful. Why all of this go away in season 2? Or just because he is the second leader in season 1 and the CEO in season 2. The directors want to show that someone may be changed when the environment changes?",10
"Devolved into collectivist drivel","I recall the first season as being outstanding. The second season went downhill and the third season has devolved into pure, left-wing political drivel loaded with collectivist tropes and ludicrous stereotypes. The first season at least gave us some partial truth about what shallow, narcissistic, backstabbing sociopaths (and other personality disorders) people in the entertainment industry are.The part that really stretches credulity is that all these filthy rich psychopaths have all-of-a-sudden become sensitive, empathetic crusaders for the common man - as if people with a summer house in the Hamptons have any concept of how middle class people live and how they think.I do love Stella, though.",4
"Yessss!!!","Claire and Corey literally ARE this SHOW!!!!! Billy Crudup literally makes me laugh and smile out loud!!!!!!!",9
"SEASON 2 IS BETTER THAN SEASON 1 - WOW","The Morning Show is probably the best series on television - be it streaming, or or or - it's intelligent, it's interesting, timely, covers so many important topics even if ti is partially in hindsight. However I really hope they will go to season 3. Great cast, well developed scripts, acting and directing - spot on.THANK YOU FOR FINALLY HAVING A GREAT SHOW THAT IS NOT VIOLENT, NOT EVEN ABUSIVE. It's just a great show!! Thank you.",10
"Very good!","The acting was phenomenal and I'm looking forward to what scandals will happen next. I also liked the way they changed gears and added new characters. There is absolutely NO way this show could have survived without a change! I enjoyed their coverage of the early days of the pandemic. Many shows (like Grey's) have all tried and failed. I see people are upset about the political side of it-but so what? If you want something better, WRITE IT YOURSELF! 😉",10
"Interesting and unpredictable","I don't really get the bad reviews this show got by critics, I almost didn't watch it because of it and I'm glad I did eventually. It's not just the acting, the plot is so interesting I binged it in a day.",9
"Amazing show","Amazing performances, complex emotion-filled characters, keeps you so engaged at all times. I loved it, I'm a huge Reese Witherspoon fan",10
"I love almost everything about this show but, MAN, can it ever be preachy!","This show is all about relationships (not just romantic) in all their messy, nuanced glory. It attempts, and succeeds, in portraying reality but tries to do it from the viewpoint of one's ""best self"". It's all about the shades of grey and the complexities of being human. Very little, if anything, in here is black and white. My only complaint is its barely concealed ""preachiness"" on being better as people but it just comes off as a bit cringey and maybe even a little condescending. They just take some of it too far while trying to hammer whatever-point-they're-trying-to-make-at-the-moment home to the audience.",9
"Yes 10 points due to unreasonable extreme low rating of haters.","Directors Mimi Leder episode 10, David Frankel episode 3, comedic director Tucker Gates episode 6, and award winning TV director Michelle Maclaren episode 8 are perfect for me. High-end costume, design, and location specifically for New York and LA which makes Ms Aniston a perfect person to play Alex Levy.
Repetition of acting since high school graduation to tv sitcoms to ""Friends"" for 10 years, to movies for more than 15 years makes Ms Aniston's performance off the charts perfect, or phenomenal for me. Rachel needs those other characters to spice up the sitcom, but Rachel was the glue that holds them together, without Ms Aniston to play Rachel would not be that interesting to me. The Morning Show starts with high end budget for the show, award winning directors, and a high caliber performance from a veteran actress. Ms Aniston should won at Golden Globes and SAG Awards because she was the most authentic perfect to play her own personality. If best actress nominees for Drama category has a perfect score of 10, Ms Aniston exceeds my expectation 10.5 rating every time. It is like she was ahead of her peers at least 25% or 1/4. Money wise she was right, Murder Mystery was a 20 million paycheck plus The Morning Show was another 20 million paycheck within 1 year, 40 million royalties from these 2 films alone.",10
"Don't waste your time","Season 2 is so bad that this doesn't even deserve the three stars I gave it. Don't waste your time. We couldn't even finish watching the season it was such a mess.",3
"Amazing show","This is must watch show for every one. It shows many critical topics in very elegant way.It show sexual misconducts at work place and its effects very well from top to bottom. It shows why you need to speak up and it's important.I dont watch dramas often but this is a good show.I loved the show, great story, screenplay and acting.",9
"'Must See' Apple TV Series","I'm watching Fleabag and Killing Eve; and this series is equally good in terms of wanting to 'keep watching'. Reese and Jennifer are amazing, the rest of cast is spot on and the writing, staging, etc all top notch. I cannot wait to see the whole series (just wrapped episode 3).",10
"Very good","I am in tears after the last episode.The characters have depth and reveal as the show goes on.",10
"All star cast","Definitely a show to get you thinking. Every actor/actress portrays their character great and I love/hate them all... If that makes sense! I really hope a season 2 comes out and soon.",8
"Season 1","I haven't watched Season 2 yet, but Season 1 has exceeded my expectations. It is brings up so much conversation and reality about sexual misconduct in the workplace. It is so well done, and the acting is awesome. Anniston and Carrell do an impressive performance in their roles.",10
"Brilliant on every level","This show is one of those that you stop and go how do they do this?! Make such smart, well written, thought provoking content. How they are able to tell so many stories, so well in everything- the writing, casting, acting..
To be able to see the multiple sides and perspectives. Brilliant. Thank you for telling these stories.",10
"Unexpectedly prodigious","Based on early reviews of 'The Morning Show' I wasn't really looking forward to watching it. It definitely wasn't a reason to start paying another streaming service money, although I am an Apple user across platforms. When I got a new iPad I received a free year of Apple TV+. I thought ""why not?"" and started the first episode on a bored Saturday morning.
I couldn't stop watching. As usual, Reese and Jennifer are spot on with every cue. They bring a certain synchronicity to the show though they are often on opposite sides. Steve Carrell brings a performance I haven't seen from him lately that was honestly a great change of pace.
Overall the show is a great watch and while I'm not sure if it's enough to pay for, I would definitely feel like I missed something if I hadn't watched it.",9
"Over the top. Constantly.","Carrell, Whitherspoon, and especially Aniston's characters are so over the top all the time it's hard to take this show seriously. It's one freak out after another (and they're not even convincing). Crudup was the only good part of the season.",2
"Can't wait for season 2","Incredible storytelling, cinematography and acting! The show has set a high bar for the upcoming season.",9
"Love this show!","Bravo Apple+! I absolutely love this show and the bountiful layers that seamlessly unravel in each episode! The most recent episode had my heart racing as I sat on the edge of my seat! The energy and emotion from each character is explosive!",9
"Highly Binge-able","Not usually a fan of Aniston's, so was surprised to find myself drawn in. Compelling story line, great performances. Don't understand the critics' kvetching on this one. Not great art, but good t.v. What's not to like? Definitely coming back for more.",9
"Wow","Great new series... can't wait for more! I was instantly hooked by the shoe and I asked my husband to buy the monthly subscription. I love the roles that Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston portray, the fact that it's not websites also makes it more natural and organic in my point of view.",10
"Season 2","Just finished watching Season 2 of THE MORNING SHOW. It picks up immediately after the events of Season 1. The Morning Show is in disarray following the firing of its host, Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell). With a ratings decline and public relations disaster on their hands, UBA executives offer an ultimatum to what's left of The Morning Show team: find a replacement for Mitch within two weeks or the show will be cancelled.While this may seem like a daunting task, The Morning Show team is up for the challenge. They consider a variety of replacements, including popular news anchor Danny Concannon (Mark Duplass) and hotshot producer Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup). They decide to go with an unknown quantity: Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon), a brash and opinionated reporter from a small town in Virginia.While The Morning Show is trying to get back on its feet, the network is also dealing with another crisis: the return of Roger Ailes (Alan Alda), the former head of Fox News who was forced out amid sexual harassment allegations. Ailes is brought in as a consultant to help UBA improve its ratings, but his presence causes tension within the company.The second season of THE MORNING SHOW is even better than the first. It's a smart, insightful look at the world of morning television, and it's brilliantly acted by an ensemble cast. If you're looking for a new show to binge-watch, this is it.",10
"Smart, insightful, well-acted","There's very little not to love about this series. It helps to be familiar with morning news shows, but the writing and acting by all parties involved creates a believable news ecosystem anyone can understand. The naked quest for power is on thrilling display here. The nuance of the Me Too movement, cancel culture, sexism and racism are explored in ways both horrifying and fascinating. And while the women take center stage, Steve Carrel holds his own. Watching him sing in an Italian accent is perfecto. Bravo to all!",9
"Phenomenal","I love everything about this show... Especially all the emotions and thoughts evoked by it.",9
"Woke destroyed it al!","S1 was simply brilliant. S2 was horrible! It's Woke, Wokier, Wokiest.. Woke is a cult, a virus and destroys everything it touches. It has infected Netflix, Prime, Disney and now AppleTV+What a shame. For some reason I only felt sympathy for Mitch Kessler! He's not a perpetrator, he's the real victim, the true hero! Wish they had given him an actual part in S2 as he's the only one worth watching.Last year after watching S1 I gave this a 9. Halfway S2 I changed my rating to a 5. Woke sentiment killed it.What a shame..",5
"Season One is a 10, Season Two is a 7","This show is so well produced, acted, and written overall. The drama and tension are palpable throughout; my heart gets racing while watching.Season One was explosive, honest, driven, to the point, and well developed. The build up of the show/season in a slow burn turned frantic pace is outstanding. It's emotional and challenging. A brilliant piece of television.Season Two still held much of the same great acting, from the previous and new characters alike. But the writing fell off for me. Far, far too many subplots. Questions left unanswered by the end of the season, and not the cliffhanger kind that would be wrapped up in a potential season three. Just random questions that the writers seem to have forgotten about answering because there was so much to keep track of. I was a little let down by Season Two after such a phenomenal first season.Hopefully the show returns and finishes strong. I think three seasons is about all these characters and storylines are built for before they run their course. The actors are amazing and the characters are intriguing, but it's not a show you can drag out without ruining.",8
"Amazing story that we've been waiting for","When I first watched The Morning Show, which is the only one tv series from Apple that I have watched so far, I thought it's pretty decent piece of art. The cast seemed to be great, the dialogs were also pretty good and the story seemed to be quite interesting. The show was getting better and better by every episode. Especially episodes from 6 do 9 were getting even more interesting and when I was just beyond watching the finale I knew it's going to be really good. But honestly what I got impressed me more than I would ever expect. As The Loudest Voice did, The Morning Show from Apple told a very brave kind of story which shows us the truth not only how the world of media works but also what is the impact of corporatism on people's everyday life. The script, the cast, the acting, the music don't need to be evaluated. Everything is just at the highest world level. If you're interested in media, politics or you just wanna see a really good story about mysteries of huge companies, this TV show is perfect for you. It's really worth the recommendation.",10
"Just wow !!!!","There is no word that can some up the episode I've just watched but wow !!The most disturbing show I have ever watched I cannot recommend it highly enough!!",10
"Cruddup!","Brilliantly paced. Your views on who is good and bad change through to the end. All the characters were well acted but the stand out for me was Cruddup! Superb!!!!!!!",10
"Great season ending! Love the story","Jen Aniston did a surprisingly good job, Steve Carrel is great as always.",8
"Technically great","Technically This show is By all means great. Acting is superb, subtle and powerful including my favorite Aniston. But the raised up agenda of me too scandal is fictitious. I still stick to my point that those women were prostitutes (they got a promotion in return and they agreed to that ) and so they should be imprisoned too.
Mitch is just a normal human being. People are no longer allowed to have relationships at work? No flirting? Like robots? This is what the show seems to promote.
So called female victims of his are just crazy in their head. Anything could have hurt their delicate feelings.",9
"Season 1 is phenomenal - Final 20 minutes are breathtaking","Season 1 starts good then builds and builds to one of the best season finales I have ever seen. Incredibly well written. The whole season is a definite must see. The series was actually written prior to the whole #metoo movement so some of the negative reviewers on here need to get their facts straight. Also addiction IS created by trauma as well as being something you can be born with. Again negative reviewers should not base their reviews on falsehoods as this weakens their whole argument. This series should be shown in schools and colleges to all students both male and female aged 15 and over.Season 2 is good but not great. Entertaining and easy to watch, great acting, but not as good a storyline as season 1. They should have changed location to a different TV breakfast show with different characters and actors.",8
"The Newsroom except with bad writing and worse acting","The only person on this show that COULD have made it worth watching ISN'T on it that much. Steve Carrell could have made this better. He is ACTUALLY a funny person. NEITHER Jennifer Aniston NOR Reese Witherspoon are funny. In fact, they are the EXACT OPPOSITE OF FUNNY. The only laughable thing about this show is HOW BAD THEY ARE AT ACTING IN THIS SHOW.You know how you think, well, I mean, Aniston, was and is nothing more than a fluff person who made Friends and that pretty much defined her. Friends was ACTUALLY the best she could ever do because it was mindless.Reese Witherspoon must have needed the money to do this show. There HAS to be a reason she agreed to do it, because this is the titanic without the iceberg and the only thing we, as an audience can hope for, IS THE ICEBERG.NOTHING in this show is interesting. You know those moments when it COULD be good, and YOU WAIT FOR THEM, yeah, they NEVER happen here.IF a show doesn't grab you within the first episode, people aren't coming back. I think Apple decided they bought 10 episodes so they had to show what they bought.I sure hope Apple kept the receipt and can get their money back.This show is just bad.",2
"A great rollercoaster with a down in Season 2!","The first season of The Morning Show blew me away. Very well written with the right spots on topics that relate to everyone. Jennifer Aniston astonishes in her performance, I highly doubted she could play a deep role like this. The second season was disappointing and made me think, that this show should have been a mini series. But actually the thirds season start brings back the great side of the show. It's a brilliant mirror to the problems that US-Society is facing at the moment. Worth a watch. The second season, as said before, is disappointing, but alright. So all in all, top notch production with a great, diverse cast.",9
"Stellar Performances and Writing","Incredible portrayal of the underlying systemic misogynystic practices of corporate culture that have faced women since we entered the workforce. An exploration of the ill-perceived and simplistic notion that the ""me too"" movement is an overcorrection that has made ' victims' of undeserving men; it portrays the deep seated, disturbing issues that sexism and misplaced power have created for decades. Cudos to Apple and the cast and producers/writers. Extremely engaging and heart wrenching. Hard to watch at times but I cheered for Witherspoon all the way through.",10
"Never a dull moment in the show !!!","Till Now I have watched 4 episodes and I think this show is different. The Casts are best and the performances are awesome. Storylines goes through ups and down and it gives you chill moments when everything is going happy. Rarely a dull moment in the show. I hope the coming episodes will take the thrill to next level.",9
"Amazing","I loved it. Great actors, great story, intelligent lines, great life lesson. Love you all.",10
"Compelling viewing","Loved this show with its timely subject matter, good story lines, outstanding acting and believable characters. Each episode left me hanging out for the next and the final was a blockbuster. Can't believe the negative reviews I've seen from paid critics, who mostly, seem out of touch and determined to slag the show because it's from Apple. Highly recommend this entertain and gripping series.",10
"Best Drama I have seen","I enjoyed this show more than I ever thought. The story seems simple to understand the first few episodes and then the storyline expands and once you realize you are in the middle of the ""me too"" movement, you realize how much you understand about all the different points of view. The Season Finale is so powerful, I haven't cried watching a show since I child watching Bambi. The characters all play such a great role, they all deserve awards. Cori ends up being my favorite character and I look forward to season 2. My only worry is that when a Season 1 of a show is a perfect 10, I do not think it can ever live up to those standards. I might just imagine a world where there was only one Season because it is just that great.",10
"Love it because it's provocative :)","I'm watching the fifth episode now and it's excellent! I love it even more because it is provocative for those who can't see further than ""F-words"" (which is ridiculous), those who are so blind and see ""far left propaganda"" (they obviously couldn't recognize ""the left"" if it pokes them in the nose) and especially those who can't stomach ""feminism""!
I myself don't see any special feminism nor anything left, but I appreciate the patriarchal point of view of MeeToo movement. I am actually learning now why male predators and patriarchal abusers see themselves as victims, which is something I've seen, but could never understand. Those guys who overlook thousands of women killed, raped, victimized by their male partners, and relentlessly talk about ""dangers of feminism"". Great show.
And the actors are just amazing.",8
"Season 2 is terrible","Amazing season 1, great storylines and characters. Season 2 is the complete opposite. Horrible storyline, sloppy pacing. Jennifer Anniston probably didn't want to do it because she's no where to be seen for almost 2 full episodes of a 10 episode season. All the characters come off annoying and selfish. They make you want to root against all of them. Cory is the only bright spot of this show. Don't waste your time, season two is trash.",2
"Brilliant","It's up there with the newsroom which I would highly recommend. The build up is slow but the finale is incredible to watch unravel",8
"A missed opportunity for sure","Just finished watching S1 and I was left wanting more; but more of a dialog with Mitch, not necessarily S2. All I can think is why did they go THAT way? Our society is ready for the #whatnext conversation, and Mitch wanted to have it. Yes...he needs to confess, repent, have a CTJ moment but then continue the dialogue he started with his friend, the creepy director. Instead, Jennifer and Reese (the producers) could not refrain from grabbing the mic and blasting the male dominated network, looking like ""those crazy women"". For some reason the female anchor got to be the first to say 'I'm sorry for not stopping it"". Ok and she's no Gretchen Carlson (who actually DID something at FOX). This was very thought provoking and for that, I appreciate the show. Why did Hannah feel she had to ""find the words to say no""? Ladies...JUST SAY NO. That's the word! And leave, that's your power. No regrets, even if you get fired. You are better off.So...What should consent look like? There are lots of women who want bragging right (can you say NBA, NFL, or Rock groupies?) No doubt both sexes are guilty. Ashley with her careless 'back alley encounter' could have really given Mitch a run for his money. That's what I want to see if S2 comes back! I was hoping this show might offer a safe and intelligent place to ponder that question. It didn't. They backed down and that was too bad.",8
"This show takes no prisoners!","Brace yourselves! You're up for a great roller coaster ride.",10
"Awesome","Great so far and is tackling some issues around the me2",10
"Best serie EVER","Excellent performances (Jennifer Aniston superb)!!! Keeps you on the edge of the seat, in each chapter throughout the whole chapter. Can't wait for season 3.",10
"I was expecting to hate this show","When I saw that AppleTV made a show about a show I thought it would me more like a close up view on how the cable news networks cook up their fake news. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that it is a serious and amusing show about how real people behave in the show making industry. In the first season they model the plot line after the Today Show. Aniston is Katie Couric or someone like her and Steve Carrell is Matt Lauer. Martin Short plays Harvey Weinstein and Billy Cruddup plays Zucker. Marcia Gay Harden plays Maggie Haberman of the NYT and so forth. There's even the button in Carrell's dressing room that shuts and locks his door from the desk like Matt Lauer had at NBC. What I like most about the show is that it shows all sides of the me-too issue as there is a continuum of inappropriate work place behavior that so many people participate in. How do you meet someone new when all you do is work? They take it seriously and that's important. Aniston has become a much better actress than her Rom Com movies make her out to be and Witherspoon is always a good actress. I've only watched the first season but I am very grateful that there is no mention of our national political divide. They barely get political and I'm thankful for that. Bravo to Apple for making such good programming. I'm happy to pay for it.",9
"Amazing","Top Actors/Actresses. Reality at it's best. Aniston, Witherspoon at their absolute best. And Billy is amazingly funny and real sh** disturber it's great",9
"Done w show","Hated Julianna M on Scandal, hate her here too. Dont enjoy her acting and not opposed to same sex couple, but she dont fit the role nor does Reese W. They look so amateurs and dont inspire emotions when seeing them together. Besides show has become boring. Always a good show ends up being ruin.Note to any who dont like my opinion: 1. Is my opinion, 2 freedom of speech, basically to express my feelings.Not discriminating the love (got it in my family) reason why I can give my 2 cents.Wish this would be told to those two. They dont make a believable couple n its not showing more sex. Its just how fake they look together.",2
"Dearly beloved","I love watching dishes with this show , on . When are you c ok'ing home , I asked and wish upon the starz. Can't act my husband and tell him his hole is ready for incubation.📞 hello -Adele . -Skyfall 2 ? Postponed ?!! 005 , 117 sparter where busy or ?#intime",10
"I'm Hooked","This show was riveting from the very first scene. It really grabbed my attention, and I was pulled into the story immediately. I didn't want to stop watching untill the final episode of the season.I was a little skeptical about Anniston. I didn't think I could get past her role as Rachel in Friends. I've never seen anything else she's acted in. But, surprisingly, she has me convinced that she is, none other than, Alex Levy in this show.Another surprise for me is how dark this show is. Who would've thought all of those cheerful morning show hosts are that hard core competitive as they are in this show?Particularly dark is Anniston's character. She's so dark in this role that I think it's a little over the top. Her character just proves what so many men in the work place already accuse wormen of. She's too, over the top, emotional. Snapping at her daughter and husband the way she does, and screaming in anger so often. I just think it's a tad bit over the top.A couple of scenes of Steve Carell's character are, also, I think, a bit over the top. But, all in all, they both do a brilliant job acting in their roles. Reese's role is not as difficult, in my opinion. Billy Crudup is brilliany in his role, and I love him and his character!! I was not familiar with Mark Dupass prior to this, but I love him now too!All in all, I loved this show so much, I watched each episode twice. I also love how fitting it is for these times of the MeToo movement. I found the analyis of the MeToo movement, by Carell's character, fascinating. I'm sure there are plenty of men who got a raw deal from women falsely accusing them of harrassment. But I think that women get the raw deal far more often. Bravo to the writers of this show to allow us to see both sides.",9
"Apple does not disappoint","Rarely does a show come along where I am so invested by the characters (main cast played by Jennifer Anniston, Reece Witherspoon, Billy Crudup and Steve Carrell). One of Apple's first original shows is exactly what 2019 needed. It has remarkable performances and an intriguing storyline for our times. The Morning Show is drama filled, intriguing, shocking, scandalous, petty, and many other adjectives. Truthfully worth a watch for a dive into a male dominated empire that examines the dark side of television and the media.",9
"Long fuse. HUGE explosion.","I've only finished season 1, but I must say I was completely fooled by the casting and first few episodes. This is NOT a comedy. It's a political drama, which can make it off putting at times because emotions and outbursts are so messy and uncomfortable, but in the end there is a discussion here that needed to be had. Outstanding performances by so many on the roster but this has definitely been Jennifer Anniston's moment to shine. This is her in top gear, a gear in which many will feel like they've never seen her before. I feel like this show really puts a mirror in front of you to make you ask yourself, if you could modify your behavior just one iota, could you be able to become part of the solution instead of part of the problem. It shines a light on our darkest behaviors that we don't want to admit exist. That will make it unbearable to watch for some, but one has to admit: this is good art.",10
"Apples flagship launch is a hit","Sharp, current, witty and with a relevant message well communicated- it's led by a standout performance from Anneston who will no doubt see fiction become reality when she picks up an award or two - the supporting cast is also pure class - high production values, well paced - not sure what more you'd want - no propaganda here, just truth!",10
"Love Love Love It","I'm already wanting season 2. The show took on a serious issue and gave both side of the story. Very impressed with the level of realness. This is a must see!",10
"Incredible","Fantastic show. Jennifer Aniston like you've never seen her before.
Amazing performances and a script that cuts to the bone.
Bravo!I was thinking to rate it 8, it didn't feel right, I considered 9, again, not right. It's a clear 10 for me, deserving it through and through.",10
"home remedy for insomnia","I made it only thru the first two episodes. Slow, boring, very uninteresting... it could be a good remedy if you cannot sleep 😴😴",2
"Great show!","Well written. Great acting. Best I've seen from Witherspoon and Aniston. This show is really good!",9
"Excellent!!! Just wow!","I have never left a review . I rarely read the reviews because you're either going to watch something or you aren't. I just wanted to express to the entire cast, writers, producers etc thatThe Morning Show was excellent. I was nearly sobbing on the last episode, it was so moving and so real. I really can't think of what to write besides, ""Wow"". Great job!",10
"Jennifer shines in this superbly crafted drama with a message","Like a horse bolting out of the gate this series opens with a dramatic flourish which one would casually expect to settle down and eventually run out of steam. However this doesn't happen and even at the end of episode four I am still reeling from the quality of this production, the finesse of its leading ladies and the insanity of it all.But what is most touching are the stories, the ones that tug at your heart strings, make you cheer, make you cry, make you wonder why did it all happen to him? Why is this happening to her? Was it deserved? It was all above board, everyone thought it was fine, was it... or more importantly is it? Then a story which laid bare the enormous cost of letting this pattern of behavior continue in the workplace.The show has made me examine my own beliefs. This has redefined my understanding and I have to thank the writers for that. So not only am I getting some stunning performances, it seems I am getting an education as well. Jennifer Aniston delivers a command performance in ways I have never seen before. Reese has an amazing touch delivering a brilliant counterpoint that is completely convincing. My hats off to Apple, superbly done.",10
"Pretty good show, provides great insight.","I never much cared for Jennifer Anniston's creations, Reese Witherspoon I used to find tolerable. In this show they do a great job, Jennifer as the diva (""the hotel has no suites""; ""I am aboard, we can go""), Reese as the young upstart who is much better than her older colleague. Steve Carell does a great job, as the perp who has no clue. Bily Crudup brilliantly portrays the evil incarnated.
Also the show gives a great insight in the bubbles in which the US gets its news, with hardly any dispassionate ""this is the news', as e.g. on BBC Radio.
Finally, cinematogrpahy is great as is the mostly older, but well chosen music.
It is no West Wing, but I look forward to the next season.",8
"I love It!!!","A great show the storyline is a bit slow but overall the acting is great i love jen she is a brilliant actress",8
"Surprisingly Good!!","After watching episode 1 I was skeptical that this might be another propaganda show but glad I stuck to it thanks to a review here in IMDB. I almost cried during episode 4 which I am watching right now. But this show reiterates just how scripted the current news shows are and how the content is controlled by who ever who owns the network. And also how social media has become a virtual courthouse where people pass judgments basis their political leaning without having any knowledge on the facts. Brilliant series which presents views on both sides of political spectrum. And this goes without saying Reese Witherspoon is brilliant in this series.",9
"S1EP05 Andrew: Julian Morris,He's so sexy,pretty hot and amazing","S1EP05 Andrew: Julian Morris,He's so sexy,pretty hot and amazing,you must make him appear in the second season and increase the showing time,please !!!",8
"Much ado about nothing","The first season was OK - a hot topic, fabulous cast, a well rounded story. The second season turned a good show into a ridiculously expensive soap opera with no clear storyline. Overdramatic acting is hard to watch, and I'm not sure we need a tv series about covid.",5
"Best show on TV right now","Smart, funny, relevant .. best show on TV right now. I was blown away with Season 2 Episode 8. The car scene with Alex and Chip was intense and so real. Every character's journey has been captivating.",10
"Powerful & Compelling viewing","This is to Apple what House of Cards was for Netflix, powerful drama that brings you in & makes you want to stay. It sets the standard that others need to benchmark.Powerful performances from Anniston, Witherspoon, & Carrell in a sharp script that doesn't follow the normal formula.",10
"Absolutely incredible","It's about time! An absolutely incredible series with incredible actors. I look forward to season two and the awareness this show brings.",10
"Better than expected, other than the abrupt wrap","I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did - but it was surprising engaging and addictive. Very well-acted and directed - Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carrell as a Matt Lauer / Les Moonves type were excellent - and Billy Crudup absolutely steals every scene he's in - as were the rest of the supporting cast.The final episode was my least favorite - it felt rushed and abrupt - most of the season was a slow-burn in terms of character development, but then suddenly it was almost as if the producers thought they had 12 episodes and then were told to wrap it in 10. But the good news is that leaves a number of open storylines to build on for season 2.Overall well done Apple!",9
"A show to tell the truth","Simply amazing and well written, well acted, light, photo, subject... Everything is good! No, excellent actually!
The point of view on sexual harassment is complete but never vulgar.
I'm not surprised about Golden Globes nominations because this show deserves to be highlighted to be shared. And definitely this show deserves a season 2!",10
"Binge Worthy & Wonderfully done","Jennifer Anniston & Reese Witherspoon at their best. It's a blurred line between fiction and the real fallout that must have happened behind the scenes when a certain highly paid morning talk show host was fired for inappropriate conduct.
Very entertaining, wonderfully written, superb cast.",10
"Beyond disappointing","After 2 stellar seasons, The Morning Wars season 3 returns with less fizz than natural mineral water. I can only imagine that after ending S2 on a covid cliffhanger the writers literally had nowhere to go. S3 episode 1 is essentially a rehash of every news story we've all seen over the past 3 years. How do I know this because they mention the 3 year hiatus repeatedly, they mention the pandemic repeatedly, make quips about lockdowns (sigh), fly into space on a billionaires rocket (groan), talk about democracy and the war in the Ukraine like they're educating us all and generally look bored doing it. I can't wait for episode 2 where they investigate the new idea of hacking. The 90s called, they want their plot line back. Utter shame a great show went totally to pot.",2
"WOW! If you still didn't watched it - watch it now! It's really good","I wish they will comeback to another season. The story is so good and addictive. I was amazed that from the powerful performance.The acting is superb - I connected to the characters, it feels so authentic.The show is a mix of drama and light realistic comedy.The writing is AMAZING!Don't watch any trailer before to not get any spoilers.Part of the show is the surprise in each episode and how it evolved. Apple TV know what they are doing. This show is one of the best I watched in a long time. The perfect escapism.I watched all 2 seasons in 5 days! That is how good it is.Why are you still here? Go and watch it haha.",10
"Solid TV Drama","The central plot centers around the #metoo movement, however, this is the first show I have seen that deals with the Covid as it unfolds, and it's evolution into our world and entrance into our every day lives. It's very effective at exploring all of the angles on how it entered our culture and our conscience.It has wonderful performances from Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carrell and Billy Crudup. But probably the shining character for me is Mark Duplass. He's the heart of the TV station and contains the inner mysteries of the series.",8
"Powerfully Accurate in Telling the Complexities of MeToo","The show is so so good and accurate in telling the complexities of #metoo, power dynamics, greed, fame, everything involved. It's a must watch show. It takes awhile to unfold all the characters' stories but it's really worth the journey. I'm so grateful women's stories are continually coming to light and hopeful for the next generation that they would feel safe to speak up and out for themselves and others. And may more people in positions of power and privilege do what Alex Levy chose to do. We have a choice to do what's right. Let's do it together.",9
"SUPERB on every level","I can't speak highly enough about this fantastic programme. It deserves every award going . Brilliant acting , great story line . This is just like Billions but in the TV industry.",10
"Simply incredible","One of the best shows I have ever seen. Its a must-watch!!!",10
"Great entertainment","This is a great show, but not necessarily for the reasons you might think. It's the personal side of the characters that makes this show. The actual TV broadcast segments are just the frame the personal relationships hang on.And I'll say it right off: Billy Crudup is outstanding. Really, he steals the entire series. And his character is incredibly likeable, a sentiment which might seem odd to those who have watched the series. Yes, his character Cory is incredibly likeable. And probably the most honest among them all.Carell does a great job too, with his character's constant attempts to salve his own conscience by convincing himself what he did was fine. Aniston's not quite so believable as the uber-career chasing monster, but she's OK.Anyway, I am pleased that it's been renewed!",9
"Amazing","This is a great tv show. If you haven't give it a try, do it. It is addictive from minute one. The performances are awesome, Aniston, Carel, Crudup, even the Duplass brother is great. Great script and great show.",9
"Doesnt know what it is.","Great players, production seems ok. It was looking like a great critique of the state of our journalism but then morphed into a 9 headed Hydra of feminism, me too, network drama, vanilla ""Network"" satire, corporate malfeasance, soap opera, etc
What is this series trying to say ?
The story drags in places which looks like an editing issue.
Im really sorry, Reese Witherspoon is a great actor, but she is miscast in this. Anniston is spot on but Witherspoon cant find her character.",5
"Great Show!","The Morning Show is exactly as the title states, it's a behind the scenes, and in front of the scenes about a veteran anchor embroiled in the #metoo era. Left alone to her own devices and being pushed out, Anniston, the other co-anchor realizes her career is on the line and fights back. Meanwhile the head of network (Crudup) shakes things up and brings in Witherspoon. Without spoiling the plot, that's the basic premise but it's much more. The cast, writing and production is top notch and delivers on every count. It's worth the binge if you're interested in seeing a fictional news network (NBC) deal with controversy behind and in front of the scenes.",10
"nice drama","A beautiful series, and it was shocking for me because it was better than I expected and I am here talking about the first season because I felt that the series was fun, it was not a waste of time, and it also gave me that everything in the camera is not real, and it also gave me the negative side of companies. This series gave me a masterpiece of drama And the best part of the series is how the relationship between Alex and Bradley turned into a beautiful relationship. A very beautiful series, I will never regret watching it.",9
"Boring and noisy and gets worst in the second season","Do not waste your time. I expect it will get awards with all the star power but it is sad and depressing with a lot of screaming and drama. Women sleep with men and feel bad about it later so they cry assault and pressure. Aniston plays the same roll she does in every movie. Carrel as a serious part is boring. It is just a waste. I'm sure it will get awards because of the liberal Hollywood roll call but it is a long walk in a dark forest.",1
"Shallow writing - don't bother","Who did they hire to write this drivel? Lazy writing that only appeals to an unintelligent audience with an ""f"" in every line of dialog. If the brain dead is your audience then you've clearly succeeded. Come on Hollywoodn't! You are losing your intelligent audience.",1
"Good acting, terrible writing.","Season 1 was pretty good. Season 2 was ok. Then season 3 was a mess.I really like the actors. They try to do a good job with what is given to them. They can't necessarily be responsible for the scripts they have to read and act out. But the writing is so typical of the far left, Hollywood produced, We are Right, You are Wrong dialogue that they do so much of these days.They try to 'hit on' on the current social issues and beat you to death with them.Having said that, if you like being preached to over and over and over again, telling you what and how to think and not allow you to have your own independent decision... then this show is for you!",4
"First season yes. 2nd season not so much","The first season was inspired. It felt like a real story with multiple layers that didnt take the easy route with the heavy subject material. A lot elements at play, a lot of complex stories with unintended consequences. It was about realizing the gravity of your actions and they did a marvelous job going through the emotions of the characters involved.The 2nd season feels lazy. Too much ""I'm a victim because ______"".It's a shame because the first season had a lot of potential. It's too bad because truly nuanced arguments aren't presented that often in today's landscape and this show had more of it than most.",4
"Season 1 barely pulled a very complicated issue, but managed remarkably; but season 2 started unwatchable!","Yes, season 1 started slow, but having famous cast members worked in keeping the attention on, then it was worth it because it got really strong in teh plot, moral issues and acting departments! The finale was amazing.Should have stopped there, if they didn't find a way to go upwards. Instead, the only way was down, and season 2 started with compromises, useless complications in the plot and... unwatchable. The cast was not enough to keep the viewing interesting, it was just bye bye.",4
"Series 2. Nope.","Shallow. Glossy. Simple. Transparent. What a disappointment.It seems phoned in and obviously written and shot during COVID it's like watching a diet version of series 1.",1
"Season 3 triggers my COVID PTSD","I loved season 1 and season 2 was okay, but season three is just terrible. Like we're all trying to put COVID behind us but for some reason this show decided to make COVID almost the main storyline. Like i still get jitters every time certain covid related topics are brought up but i had to stop watching the show five minutes into episode 5 it was making me feel anxious/ reliving the pandemic.Then all the references to Ukraine, January 6th and other real world stories is just too much. I've News subscriptions for all this stuff. I watch fiction shows to escape the present world not for fiction to blend in the real one.Also the show itself is just flat. It seems to have completely moved away from the premise of the original idea and in many ways just seems to drift. I also think it's being too much real world. I don't care if there is a season 4 I'm not even gonna finish season 3.",1
"Whirlwind","We are lead to believe that strong people constantly cuss at one another, scream every moment they feel stress, show up to work drunk, act subordinate to play their own agenda and cry whenever they feel emotional.Right.Jennifer plays Jennifer. Reese plays Reese. Like two cats at each other's necks. Claws out. Constant insanity unless on camera on stage.Why is every other line some insane monologue?I think the reason why people voted this show a 10 is because they enjoy the pace. It keeps moving forward. Or maybe it's because it feeds the new generation of jerks their daily dose of jerk medication.",3
"Revised my rating after torture of season 2.","First season was great. Great script, big names and it kept you hooked. Second season was like a slap in the face! Incoherent, no script, no direction, peppered by new characters with no connection to the story. It was as if every morning it was decided what to blurt out today on the morning show! I am just shocked at how dumb human beings are getting in this particular industry. Lot of decline. Terrible tv show, and heads need to roll.",4
"Boring and unprogressive","Episodes are way too long and filled with boring chatter that doesnt add much to the story or characters . Cast felt unfitted in their roles as well. Could of made them more pact with interesting stories and and 30 min episodes. The last episode was good , quite eventful and not boring as can be expected .",1
"Kind of a waste of a lot of talent","How did so much money and thought and time and energy result in a very mediocre product? There's nothing wrong with the show except that it's blandly predictable and not very interesting. And, it takes itself way too seriously; it's almost as if you can hear everyone connected to the show saying to each other, ""We're creating a really important show.""They're not. Ever bake a bad cake from a great recipe? That's what this is.It's a recipe for a good tv show; it's not an actual good tv show.",4
"Started off good then Season 2 spoilt it.","As soon as it started it's lesbian thingy I turned it off. What's up with these script writers, they have a successful show then ruin it. The first series was well written and I appreciate the need for change but why does it always have to be along this sort of line. The actors all provide good performances and there are some god story lines. I can imagine that this is how many TV shows are run. I was looking forward to watching season 2 on Apple TV+ but I do not find this type of story line tasteful. I appreciate it goes on but all too often TV shows rub our noses in it. Many will enjoy this new story line but not me.",3
"Super elitist take on the pandemic","The show is excellent in keeping you hooked with million-dollar visuals in every frame. But apart from that, it is kind of boring and empty. Either the show does an extremely competent job in showcasing the industry & its people, or it is just too self-absorbed in its Ivory Tower riches to connect to its very regular non-millionaire viewers.The first season was still watchable, but the treatment of the pandemic in the second show was tasteless, tone-deaf and a bit too elitist - especially as the pandemic still rages on.Cancelled my Apple TV+ subscription right afterwards (not that it matters to anyone 😅) - seeing that there is nothing else watchable on the platform anyway.",5
"First season was ok","The idea of this show seemed great and it was interesting and captivating. Great stars and then it just kind of goes no where. Finished season one and then season 2 came out and tried an episode. Just recycled garbage from season 1 and it doesn't go anywhere. Couldn't even finish more than 2 episodes of season 2. It's really that bad. Seems to be a lot of drama going on and the dark negative back stabbing going on just really gives it a negative vibe that I couldn't even stomach watching more of it.On the other hand Ted Lasso was exactly what I needed to get out of the dark place this show put me and I'm much happier now.",3
"White man bad","Another fine example of how white men are bad, women of all colors are good. The vast majority of men in this show are either written to be complete bungling fools or evil misogynistic characters and all inferior to women at all times.",1
"Absolutely awful","I've never seen such weak nasty backstabbing unstable women characters all in one show. There is not one person to root for. I'm angry I wasted my time watching this show about a sexual predator and two middle aged bitchy women who get drunk and swear and scream at each other and everyone else. Go watch Peaky Blinders, The Shield, Breaking Bad or any other show.",1
"Season 2-what a shame","Season one was great and really brought a serious issue to light apolitically, as well as being entertaining. Anniston was great playing a stuffy news media star. Then she turn back into Rachael from friends, and that continued into season two. Clearly she's limited as an actress. Witherspoon made a similar reversal of personality. Second season role does not match.Too bad, but the show lost all steam. Next.",5
"Generic and formulaic","Only gets a 3 due to acting. The story is formulaic, boring, and predictable. I'd give it a one if it weren't for some of the performances. You'd be a lot better off watching any quality show on HBO.",1
"What a disappointment","After two reasonable seasons - certainly not great - the third season of The Morning Show is absolute rubbish.It looks like the people behind the series decided to take their audience for a ride by revisiting ideas and scenarios from the earlier seasons. Well, if you keep treating your audience as fools they will not be your audience for long.The acting is fair, with the exception of some dreadful performances from Jennifer Aniston. She looks like a personable woman, but I do not know why she went into acting. I do not intend to be mean, but I challenge anyone to assess her acting in this and give an honest opinion that it is good.A big miss.",2
"Poor Script...poor actors","Aniston and Whiterspoon unfortunately didn't convince me. Jennifer plays a narcissistic diva who only thinks of herself, towards the end she at least seems believable. Reese switches back and forth between played empathetic journalist who wants to save the world and an annoying screamer. The two try too hard. The chemistry between the two is also off, whether they are bitching at each other or playing best friends, they both seem like they don't want to be where they are and overdo it with their facial expressions. After episode 7, I could barely watch Reese's attempts to produce a dramatic look, and I usually liked her. But here she comes across as a rookie.In general, there was a lot of screaming here, but it was so emotionless that the screaming was just annoying. It's an eternal back and forth. The script is poor. I was amazed, the show is supposed to be very popular, but it's incredibly shallow. No one can take it seriously. The fact that I stayed with it as long as I did is due to the star ensemble and the hope that something good would come out of it after all. No. It ends just as lamely as it began. In the end, I felt redeemed, it's over.",1
"Characters for all walks of life, CHECK MY EDIT","The first thing I will say about this show is there is a good spread of talent. The first season was remarkable, clever and some very funny moments. If you had to say that one person makes this show great, Cory played by Billy Crudup is absolutely genius. His sarcasm is a thing of beauty that is very tough to master such likable ability. You can't help but root for Chip and Yanko either who are great additions. You will at times be infuriated by Alex (Aniston) and Bradley (Witherspoon) as they are very self centred characters but the blend makes it necessary. All in all, this is a great look at the daily function of a news program, highlighting industry issues that have been capped by the Me Too movement. Highly recommended!Edit after watching season 3..... my rating has dropped dramatically, to a 5 out of 10. This is base's purely of the fact that the creators thought it would be great viewing to repeat the exact same boring scene between Bradley and Laura over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over and over again! Pointless conversation of self pity, blame and tantrums. Ridiculous!",5
"Can Hollywood Write any Dialog that isn't the F word Every Other Word","The dialog consists entirely of the F word. Obviously they don't have a writer who know other words. The story is decent, but after 6 episodes, I don't feel as though I've gotten anywhere. This current world is depressing enough without the depressing drama in this series.",3
"Ridiculously Over acted and under directed.","I dont know what they were thinking when they wrote the screenplay and decided to pace it so horribly and not use background scores to make scenes better.Did the director not watch the actors or was he too scared to correct the ridiculous acting by the lead cast. Reese Witherspoon is unbearable to watch and character development & arc are all over the place, you cant empathize with this character at all and she acted really badly in her scenes.Jennifer Aniston is more bearable to watch but it seems like she was so determined to show her dramatic acting skills that she has overacted & overreacted in many scenes. Her character development and arc are also wayward & many of her reactions don't make any sense in accordance with her characters motivation to gain control.The direction is just ridiculous of this show and its terribly paced.",2
"This is the kindergarten version of The Newsroom","The writers of this show are trying too hard to be Aaron Sorkin... and spoil alert, they sadly failed. When you don't have witty dialogue or even close to engaging scenes, but your characters don't know that and are still pretending they are in The Newsroom... It just makes everybody look like kids playing pretend... AND, it's amazing how the script chooses the LEAST interesting and MOST expected way possible. If this is Apple's headliner then oh my they are in some trouble.",5
"Too much vulgarity and anger","Why do they think they need this much vulgarity? Why does every third sentence seem to have the ""F"" word? And why is there so much anger? This series has an important message. But this message is lost among the vulgarity and temper tantrums.",3
"Predictable garbage","Just a waste of time. Skip it. About halfway through the first season I had to start fast forwarding conversations that were exactly the same over and over. The plot points got stale and repetitive. Just predictable woke storylines. Not very entertaining for me.",3
"Same character every acting role.","Reese Witherspoon is not a diverse actor. She plays the same role in everything she does. She loves to bring out her character from the movie Freeway in every piece of work she does. It has gotten old.",1
"Not bad. Not good.","Huge actors. Great production value. Shallow story.Worse... No style.It's a super polished iPhone ad about people who love to sob about who hosts a morning show on a cable network. Maybe it's because I haven't had cable tv in 5 years but it completely baffles me to why anyone would actually find this entertaining or relevant.I challenge everyone to count the many Apple devices that sit in as supporting characters. Made it a fun game for friends.Tons of cursing, drinking, crying, anger... but not in the way of Billions or Succession or GOT. Throw in pop and r&b music and still waiting on punch line... no style... in the words of Simon Sinek, no ""why"".Sorry Tim, stick to your politics and part time CEO role. Cue the downvotes from the Apple diehards. Every downvote is an upvote.",3
"It was ok but repetitive","It started off very well and interesting but as the season progressed it began to get tiresome. Most of the characters are very unlikeable and and annoying. I found the latter half the first season a hard slog.At times I found myself struggling to stay awake as there is a lot of talking and not enough action. Most of the characters began to annoy me and frustrated me. I'm not sure if I could face watching season 2 after sitting through season 1 and not enjoying it as much as I though I would have.I will give praise on the acting though which I found to be very good and believable., the supporting characters were very well played out.",5
"Why ?","Jennifer Aniston is the most OVERRATED actress in Hollywood history and it's not even debatable ... why is this woman still on TV ? There are many actresses who would mop the floor with her when it comes to acting and they're not getting any movies or shows anymore but this overrated talentless hack gets everything since 1994 ...Like seriously enough of her already it's enough that she got that Emmy handed over to her when she didn't deserve it .",1
"Wake me up when it's over","What a snooze fest. The long awaited, star packed snooze fest. Firstly J Aniston and Reese have passed their prime. They don't have any charisma, Reese has the same monotone acting she always has had, and the show lacks that umph that hooks viewers. The premise is interesting and topical but the execution is terrible. They missed the mark on this one.",5
"Boring, cheap script","They wanted to create a series about nowadays problems, but it's so boring to watch. I don't understand all the hype around it.",1
"Yawn fest","Massive yawn fest with no interesting characters. Hard to get past the fact that the characters are all big name actors. ""Look it's Steve Carrell. There's Reece Witherspoon. Rachel from Friends is married to the guy from Coupling"". I was even more interested in discovering one bloke in the fires I had seen on Snow Piercer. Dull as dishwater.",3
"I can't tell","Season one was really great. Good story and interesting development. The show went down hill from there with seasons two and three. I can't tell if the over the top New York liberalism is being made fun of or glorified. As the show has gone on, I feel like there are very few characters that I like or connected with anymore. Maybe this is intentional. Billy Crudup is absolutely the best. He character along with Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell hooked me in season one. The story and writing are decent if somewhat predictable. I will be interested to see how season three ends. Just one episode left.",5
"Boring","While it's an original show, the story is riding on the strength of the popularity of the main actors (Aniston, Witherspoon, Carell). It's a completely predictable plot and you'll know exactly where it's going, so when you get up for the fourth time - out of sheer boredom - to get a snack and try to power through the episodes, regardless of how bored you are - you won't feel like you've missed a thing at all. The acting is cardboard, everyone playing a version of themselves, and it's just nothing outstanding or original about it. The fact that some viewers are content with waiting until episode 3/4 to get into it shows how complacent viewers have become of mediocre television. One shouldn't have to spend 2-3 hours to have a story be mildly interesting. If this is an example of what Apple TV is capable of, I'd definitely give it a pass.",2
"Not good.","The car scene is awful. They should have just driven in silence the whole way. Want to watch a his show about about TV news? Watch ""The Newsroom."" Much, much, better.",4
"Milking the concept","Season One was a very good take on morning TV, but the latest offering is just bland.What is wrong with the creators of TV series these days? They come up with a good idea and then just milk the concept until there is nothing of interest left. It treats us viewers as idiots without any ability to discriminate between fresh and mundane. News flash! Most of us can!Some of the reviews here seem to be created by members of the families of writing crew. Yes, they are so wide of the mark that I find i hard to believe hat they are legitimate.The direction is also so-so; just look at the performance of Jennifer Aniston (who needs a top notch director if she is to put in a creditable performance).",2
"Disappointed","This is the second show I've started to like that I gave up on (the other being a million little things). Like a million little things, the first season of this show was great. Then they immediately dove face first into real life. We have the news and we have social media, why do we also need fake tv to tell us exactly what's happening in the world?",3
"The Newsroom it ain't","Desperately trying to be The Newsroom this show fails miserably. While I deeply disagree with Aaron Sorkin's far left politics I have to respect his writing. The Morning Show lacks anything close. In an effort to make up for the depth, wit and intellect they have opted for profanity in their attempt to be 'edgy'. Billy Crudup deserves accolades for bringing life to the script and his character, were it not for him and the ocassional sparkles from Steve Carell there would be no redeeming value.",5
"Jennifer Aniston brings it down","The show is great but episodes that Aniston is featured in brings it down. Her character is so unlikable and too much of a whiny self-absorbed entitled. Yes that's her character but it's also the way JA plays it. She's just a terrible actor unfortunately. Her crying scenes are painful to watch because they're like watching someone pretending to cry, pretending to act sad. It's just not authentic at all. Reese W. Is borderline, a little better than JA. Sadly they just killed off one of the best and most interesting/ complex characters and best actors - Steve Carrell. Its astounding that JA gets the kudos she does. She really is just a terrible actor.Season 3 -
Billy crudup / Cory - continues to be the best part of the show - fantastic.The story is more engaging interesting. But the acting from Aniston is terrible and Reese's acting gets worse too. Both have this awful duck face fake cry that is so distractingly awful. Anistons acting waas briefly better but by end of season it was painfully bad - probably cause she had to show more emotion. Which she and Reese suck at.Production wise - please fire the continuity person. In addition to the many plot holes and story lines they expect you to somehow know (Reed on the golf course? Sloan? Skipping whole pandemic? Flash backs that dont add up) the continuity is so sloppy. Its day its night its same night but the outfits are different.When cory meets paul marks in the hotel he walk IN carrying a folder which he places on the table. When he leaves he hands the folder to the hotel person like it's a menu. I kept waiting for there to be some secret document hand off plot twister... but nope. I rewatched multiple times to see what I missed... nothing.Also they incorrectly make claims to stuff that happened - you go back and watch and it didnt happen - Reeses claim Paul knew exactly what laura said to her - that he quoted her... No he didnt. Her paranoia came outta nowhere and made no sense. I had to go back and rewatch.This goes to the bad acting but the only relationship that shows any ,ind of emotion of feeling like it might be real human emotion is Cory towards Reeses and occasionally Reese toward Cory. Laura and Reese are terrible - zero chemistry or rhyme or reason. It's like they just decide okay - now you two date.The whole eavesdropping / spying / blackmail of a huge company and employees.... they're gonna just IGNORE... THAT'S how they start ""CLEAN"" and ""better""?? Eye roll.Whatever happened in the hospital with cory and reese when they go looking for her brother? They keept flashing back to her washing her hands but never reference what it is. And the whole Chip and Aniston unrequited love... that just comes outta no where. No signs of it - just suddenly theres jealousy in season 2.For the budget they have the writing, story lines, acting, continuity should be tighter. They cant get rid of Aniston at this point I assume Reese will come back. And hopefully the saving grace of cory.It's entertaining to watch and see what happens but aside from Cory its not award winning show.",5
"???","I can not understand how on earth this series got that high rating??
It is (my opinion ) such a boring and bad acting series. I really tried to give it fair chans but no no no......so bad acting.",1
"Loved the first season, season 2...not so much","Too much liberal indoctrination. I honestly thought episode four was a satire, trying to jam as many 'social justice' themes into one episode as possible because, let's be honest, it's just been over the top in the media lately. Nope, after watching the behind the scenes, it was exactly their intention. WOW. They lost me as a viewer...I'll just watch CNN instead if I want to feel bad about my 'privilege'.",5
"Progressive Conspiricy Soup","Good acting and entertaining. But it's so bent left with every progressive conspiricy theory in the past 4 years pushed so far to the extreme that it's comical.If you're not a left-wing radical it's difficult hanging in for certain episodes, especially season 3.From Trump to SCOTUS to COVID, vaccines to the ""insurrection"", calling Bradley's brother a terrorist, lol. And then of course there's climate change and the best was how it was going to kill billions.At times, it felt like watching Morning Joe or The View. Luckily that doesn't make up the majority of seasons 1 & 2 but they lay it on pretty thick in 3. If it weren't for the writing and other very good story lines it would be difficult to watch much of the series.",5
"Disney on Ice, but basically for washed up, well-off actors","This is one of those shows that basically is a cushy gig for big-name actors who once were on the A-list but are just looking for something to do. How can the director even get the best out of these guys? They'll walk off the set if you even glare at them the wrong way. So it's a lazy, low-effort production with bad acting and a lot of yelling and fast-talk to make it seem profound when it really isn't. Instead of just being normal, everything is overacted. Do real news anchors wake up glamorous, pensive and profound? Where are their kids? Why are they always scheming? I've seen this a million times before, instead of taking the opportunity to accurately depict what these people go through everyday, it goes the lazy, cliched route.Pass, this is just a show Apple rushed to get content for their streaming channel.",1
"Ugh","First season was good enough to keep my attention. Second season was not good, but I felt committed and hoped it would take a turn for the better. Third season was horrible.The story lines got so stretched out and the writers/characters tried to make a drama about everything. Each and every issue goes beyond what a real person would think or act. The holier-than-though attitudes approach got sickening. The characters themselves were in constant contradiction. One episode they say/act one way and then three episodes later they say/act exact opposite. Just horrible writing.They just tried to cover way too many social issues. Always trying to make some statement, but doing a horrible job. Only showing one side and presenting it like 99.9% of the world feels the same. A few, very rarely, tried to show a character feeling opposite opinion, but then within a few minutes they make that person apologize for their feelings.Do yourself a favor and do not get caught up in it like I did. I feel terrible about the time I wasted on this show.",2
"There's mo comedy","When you open IMDb page of this show, it says Comedy, Drama. There is no comedy in first episode or it isn't funny enough that I completely missed it. I can barely get though the first episode, the acting wasn't great and script seems weak. I expected more from Apple after watching See, that was brilliant.",4
"Season 3 is Absurdly Obnoxious","While the first season is by far the better of the two, seasons 1&2 are solidly entertaining. Rather than keep the focus on the seriously flawed characters and the challenges requisite with producing TV news, which was at least relatable, season 3 pivots to current events in the most rodeos way. This season is for progressives, by progressives, and about progressives all of whom believe their minority positions on controversial topics are actually supported by their viewers.The J6 and Dobbs leak storylines are particularly ridiculous, but they are only the largest examples among many perspectives on the show that are completely foreign even to the most openminded of us in middle America. They do take a trip to the border to report on the ""crisis"", which of course everyone knows is a lack of abortion pills, not illegal immigration. There's even a ruthless evil billionaire with a rocket company (Musk much?) who is trying to acquire a media company.",1
"Could they use the F word any more than they did????","Aniston has a real mouth on her. Never thought that Rachel Green would ever turn out like this. Reese Witherspoon is very good in the series. I could only watch each one out of curiosity. No entertainment value at all. Just a lot of people with a lot of problems. At least they fit into the rest of the world.",2
"boring tv show about old media","Boring plot and this is definitely garbage with AAA stars in it",1
"Pushing the Narrative","At first I thought, ""The Morning Show"" would show a refreshing and fair take on the #metoo movement. However after a very promising start it seems to have swung into being about promoting the ""narrative"" both of #metoo and the pandemic. If you are okay with the propaganda we've had shoved down our throats for the past three years then you may love this show.Reese Witherspoon delivers a very good performance. Jennifer Aniston however is rather pathetic. Certainly we could call Jennifer's performance very good, but it's not enjoyable to watch (after the first season or so). Steve Carell does deliver great acting (quite a surprise to me as previously I've not enjoyed his work). Billy Crudup is energetic (which seems to be his normal onscreen persona) and plays an interesting character.This is definitely a ""love - hate"" show, with some excellent aspects and some aspects that encourage NOT watching the next episode.",5
"Who wrote this???","The writing for this show is an insult to one's intelligence. A mediocre show with an unbelievable and weak storyline.It's a cheap soap opera poorly acted.Don't waste your time.",2
"You'll love it if you are a liberal.","Not so much if you are not. One line sums it up well when the people that visited the capital on Jan. 6 are referred to as ""terrorists"" - really???While the character names are different, it's obvious who many of them are mimicked after. It's unfortunate that the political viewpoint is purely one sided as the show would hold promise for a much broader appeal if it were to balance out the political views. Although, maybe it really reflects the state of our media today. It's not about reporting the facts anymore but rather making the facts or making up the facts to fit your political parties narrative.",4
"HOW is this show rated so high?!","First of all, the show was pretty decent in the first season. However, Reese Witherspoon (both the actress herself and the character she plays) has rendered it essentially unwatchable. Bradley is the epitome of hypocrisy - judgmental, self-serving, self-aggrandizing, preachy. Overall insufferable. The way her character makes, quite literally, everything about her and what she wants is infuriating. 99% of Bradley's scenes are utterly exhausting.Aside from the godawful leads, the show is just...meh. Characters die, and no one really grieves. They mention someone who was at some point or other a somewhat integral character every now and then, but there's no real concept of the loss you feel when someone you're with all day every day suddenly isn't there (and the deaths that occur were under truly tragic circumstances as well, making the gloss-over doubly suspect). Other characters just...disappear...and the rest of the cast acts like they never existed. Oh, and ""character development""? Not a thing on this show. They display someone as being one way, then have them do a complete 180 for no. Apparent. Reason.I'd like to say it's just bad writing, but the casting is awful, the preachiness is headache-inducing, and I honestly cannot believe I watched this whole train wreck from start to finish. The Morning Show isn't as bad as that Palm Beach show, but it's pretty awful.",4
"Pretty bad","I wanted to like this show. I wanted to love this show. But so far it's just bad. The characters just stand around talking but nothing keeps them together. You kind of feel bad for Alex, but then you realize they've literally stolen this entire idea from the Today show. Maybe the space show will be better. This one is not worth the investment.",5
"Overacting","Jenifer Aniston and Steve Carnell both over acted the scenes after the whole firing incident. So much drama just for a job and both characters were millionaires.",3
"Deleted after 15 minutes......","I watched the trailer and I was looking forward to a good show.15 minutes in, I stopped watching and deleted the series from my watch list.Love Jennifer and Steve, Most of the A list are good actors. Why do you have to build in fake drama and shows of iPhones into every show? Is that what sells? Doesn't matter. Youtube reruns are better than this show.",3
"High expectations dashed","Expectations dashed
Into the sink of crap and washed out.
Expected more of cast but the script fails them as the writers seem flummoxed with the task of achieving a hit for Apple TV plus .
Too many are reaching for the ring that Netflix holds so firmly",1
"The Matt Lauer Story from the POV of the Rich and Powerful","Hey look, it's a dramatization of the Matt Lauer Story where we try to muddy the water about what an extreme monster Matt Lauer was.And Jennifer Aniston's character writes off the victims as worthless nobodies.And the outspoken conservative reporter from Fox News is coming over to save everyone.The rich and powerful are the true victims and we should cry for their over-the-top melodrama.HARD PASS.Mark Duplass didn't suck.",2
"Zzzzz","What a waste of excellent actors. Boring scripts, shallow characters, and to top it all off the clunky, insensitive abuse of the very real tragedy of the Vegas mass shooting. What a dumpster fire. If it were not for Aniston and Carell, it would get zzzzero stars.",2
"Just like every other workplace TV drama (duplicate)","Have fans of the show been living under a rock, all these years? This is such a rip-off of the Nashville series, and a poor attempt at trying to compete with excellent shows like Unreal. Unfortunately, it is done big network style, with annoying political correctness and anti heroes who don't even own being awful human beings. The whole #MeToo thing in season one, got out of hands. But it's the most entertaining season to date. And the way characters kept using Mitch, as a scapegoat for their own bad behavior in season 2, would've been the worst part of a disappointing year. If it wasn't accurate to the current messed up mentality. If depicting them this way, was to turn the show into a satire of the prevailing hypocrisy, in this background and beyond. Then great job writers. Otherwise, eh... I'm yet to watch season 3, but the way the previous one ended, is discouraging me from carrying on with this series. Obviously I love all the actors, and that's the show's strongest suit for me. See all these actors I love in one show, is a blessing. Only it's a shame it is to star in such a mediocre melodrama, with COVID shenanigans and far left agendas smeared all over the screen.Report me all you want, I made a copy of it anyway.",3
"An Italian Scrappy-Doo can't save this mess.","The characters are unlikeable and the plot is meandering. It's so boring that they had to add an Italian Scrappy-Doo character in the second season. It's really laughable.",1
"Overrated","Great cast and acting, but cringeworthy, predictable soap opera plots and constant bickering-and-making-up cycles are tiresome. Not a single likable character on this show.",3
"Season 2 super boring","The only good thing about S2 is that Witherspoon no longer wears that awful wig from S1. Surprisingly boring and without storyline, the second season was just a huge waste of my time.",4
"Lost Direction","I've rarely seen a tv show that I liked as much in its first year only to venture into the wilderness in the second! I had great anticipation for season 2 but I am missing the interaction between Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Anniston that was so engaging last season. The whole Mitch storyline leaves me disinterested this season. To top off my disappointment, it seems that Jennifer cannot get through an entire sentence this season without at least three or four f-words. I just do not know anyone who really talks like that, even in private conversation. I will finish Season 2, just to see if they can bring off some level of closure and in hopes of a better Season 3.",5
"Eye candy?","Fun to watch to a point, but the two dimensional characters get quickly tiresome. A trusted friend opined that Jennifer Aniston had reached beyond her mediocre standard but she's the same vanilla ice milk as ever. Always love to watch Steve C but the cliche ridden script takes him down, too. The 40 something Reese Witherspoon can no longer play a 30 year old character, so it's just a lot of star power falling flat with only the Chip character offering some true delight amongst the cardboard cutouts. We grew quite bored by episode 5. The show itself is made of the same coarse cloth of the industry it pillories, so the satire falls flat by virtue of its sameness and myopic hypocrisy.",5
"DaHell...?","I'm two episodes in and all I can say is I won't be going any further, this is a show that had potential, which just evaporated like a fart in a car once the window was rolled down.....",3
"Jennifer Aniston can't act in drama.","Halway through the second episode:
Steve is even better in serious roles evident from the movie ""Little Miss Sunshine"". He is just so amazing that an average actress like Jennifer Aniston makes the show look dull. Other actors don't matter yet.",1
"What a Shame!","Watching the first few episodes, I thought this could be something quite refreshing and edgy, something that dared to step outside of the very contemporary dross that is pandering to a woke agenda and actually show both sides of a complex and emotive topic. I was wrong. The final episode reveals that it dared do none of that but rather sought to drive home the tired and fast-becoming-dated notion that there is only one opinion to be had on anything that crosses the METOO line. A quite cringeworthy final scene shows the proclamation of a ""loud and clear"" message as though it is something original and controversial, when all it actually is is pointing to the conventional and only currently acceptable side of the moral compass. One day there will be something which has the guts to challenge, and the intelligence to question, the exaggerated, claustrophobic and wholly dictatorial premise of the METOO movement. Or perhaps accept that there is a debate to be had, that minority opinions that differ from those of the pervasive culture do have the right to be aired. Or, at the very least, accept that there are two sides to every story. This certainly was not it.",1
"The Botox Show","It's probably not fair to judge people on their looks, but it does affect the show. Jennifer Aniston's character is supposed to be a mix of emotions, but her face looks the same with every emotion thanks to that filled up upper lip. It just looks ridiculous. Just as Mindy Kaling, Kate Vernon and Marcia Gay Harden do, flat faces without any expression. Why?The show itself is full of cliché's and has a way to obvious agenda. And I can't understand why a massive budget show like The Morning Show uses godawful green screen scenes. This is a $300 million dollar show.. Well, I guess we now know it's not spend on the production and writing, but on Jennifers upper lip.",3
"Overacted Cliche","Overacted expletives laden string of cliche scenes. Tiresome.",1
"Largely uninteresting","More uninspired storylines about shallow, narcissistic americans and their exasperatingly self indulgent celebrity culture. Aniston and Carell need to be funny, their characters are just loathsome, but there are some memorably evocative and engaging performances by Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Hannah Schoenfeld) and Bel Powley (Claire Conway). Hollywood's efforts these days are largely generic and tiresome. For a truly good episodic show check out the UK thriller ""The One"".",3
"Terrible Show.","Wow, this is a bad series. I painfully watched 3 long episodes. There is not one single character that has any redeemable qualities. They are all two faced. Which doesn't shock me, knowing how bad real life network tv news is. All the characters are written to be selfish and to care about no one but themselves. I'm actually mad that I gave this series a chance. Do not watch.",1
"Very American","In the first 15 minutes, Reece Witherspoon throws a tantrum, Steve Carell throws a tantrum, Jennifer Ainston throws a tantrum and some other guy a director I think throws a tantrum. That was enough for me in what appeared to me a very very American series.",2
"Un enjoyable with characters in constant stress and anxiety","I stopped watching because I simply got tired of watching a show with people being hyper anxious and miserable. I like drama and action but this was just people so stressed out and at their worst - pretty much every single character!",1
"This show is neither here nor there","All the hype about this show is just what it is.. Hype.. None of the characters are interesting or even have something important to say other than self deserving opinions, dialogue is not smartly written, there is no heart to ANY subject matter...Yes there is an important #MeToo conversation in there but it doesn't go anywhere...and frankly it feels that apple has bought that golden globes awards for Jenifer Aniston just like TWS bought the award for Alex Levy. Sorry Apple, you must have realized the life imitating art part of this.I sat thru the episodes waiting for the storyline to blow me away but it hasn't, until now i don't know what the motivation of Alex Levy character is, yeah she is a narcisist ambitious woman but then every now and then we see her in her ""Rachel"" mode trying to be sweet and kind. It really gets confusing. I feel Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell played their part better than Jen Aniston as people inside a whirlwind tornado of MeToo. We get the character of Mitch Kesler who is charming but predatory and Bradley Jackson as the newest addition to the group trying to settle in and finding her place, but again for the 1st season there is NO CHARACTER ARC for them at all?? There is not ONE Single Character in the series that have an anchor, nobody seems legit, nobody knows what they are doing and nobody understands themselves at all. Its like seeing a bunch of people with lots of money without self integrity running around trying to come to terms with their existantial
crisis they are having.It really felt uneasy watching this show, the same way you feel uneasy when you watch the news... it gives you anxiety, because you just don't know what the hell is going on.",3
"Feels like reality tv","I don't know why would anybody care about any of the characters",2
"Nobody cares about the storyline","Who said TV networks were interesting?
They are the most obnoxious people in the world, doing a story about them is pointless.",1
"ridiculous and incredible show :(","You can't watch anything anymore without being force-fed feminist propaganda...seriously, if I acted at work in the same way as some of the female roles, I'd be sacked on the spot.where are Mitch's lawyers?? ridiculous and incredible show",1
"Great actors and bad writing!","Sorry, but it's just badly made show! Watching it, i feel embarrassed for the actors, which i love and respect very mach!",1
"Not that good","For 15 million dollar per episode, I guess I was expecting more than a ABC/NBC type show. Does not compare to HBO or Showtime standards.",4
"Rachel will always be Rachel!!!!","The show should be ended in the first season and that's it, now the 2nd one is only focusing about Jennifer Aniston and nothing else but her, it's like she is the only character in the show.Rachel will always be Rachel!!!!",4
"Awful, awful, awful","The only reason I tuned in was for Reese. Even he perky face could not save this disaster. Don't bother watching.",1
"Good Actors, Bad Writing","The acting was good because they hired great actors. However the great acting does not out weigh the lazy writing. +10 stars for acting. -5 stars for lazy writing. -1 star for the god awful music selection and the 3 minute intro.",4
"Eh","This show was great until it went woke. Any hints of wokism in the movie business will continue to ruin anything they produce.........................................................................................................................",5
"Interesting until episode 4","Very well acted. Interesting, diverse characters but I felt that episode 4 is going more for shock value. Shame, I was really hooked up until then.",2
"Leaves You Wondering","As we exist in the golden age of television, with a buffet of compelling writing and directing at our fingertips, The Morning Show is underrealized, overstyled grey matter unfit for even the common palate. Disney-sitcomesque, hyper-perfect styling is nauseating to the sight yet an honest veneer for this empty indulgence we are about to consume. A severe and noticeable shortage of depth in its characters can be deduced to a result of dependence on the studding of its cast. I often found myself snickering at the predictability of the plot in front of me even though the show attempts to demand a serious attitude from its viewer. My yearning for spontaneity was ultimately satisfied through awkwardness found in ill-timed reactions of the actors. This measurable inadequacy of nuanced storytelling left me cringing, teeth clenched, ultimately wondering how this production could find any room for accolades that wouldn't raise a curious brow from the public.",1
"Why so much swearing","I don't know why people think that dropping the F word makes a show better? I understand it's use if reasonable, but this is so over the top, I'm not going to watch these shows anymore. It detracts from the story and acting, which are so good in this show.",1
"Pretentious show with big names","They spared no expenses when it came to the stellar cast.I hear the leads are getting paid million per episode However, the dialogue is boring and I could not care less about any of the characters.Everyone on the show is very pretentious. Don't expect to entertained or to sit at the edge of your seat. It's boring. They need to get better writers.",2
"Good Premise Gone Wrong","How could Apple with all its resources, good actors, an intriguing & timely premise create such a disaster? The Morning Show is barely watchable. I found myself trying to hang in long enough to see if it would get better. I have no idea where all the rav reviews are coming from. Sure hope AppleTV figures out what it's about.",2
"Boring","Trys to do too much. poor verion of newsroom.
Apple have paid too much for a avg show, it has a good cast but lacks good writing.",1
"iPhone 12 released before Covid-19","As if we didn't have enough of Covid-19 way before season 2 was filmed. Boring topic producers. On a funny side, how did UBA staff obtain iPhone 12s six months before any other user.",5
"The cast is not I question. It's the writing ... and directing.","You really want to like this show when watching it. The actors are all giving fantastic performances and they are trying their best to make it work.Ultimately though, it's a great cast and premise squandered through bad writing.The sequence of events is forced in a few places in a way that would seem inauthentic at best. The car scene for one. The dialog is just awful in places.The cast has chemistry and if you turn the sound off this would look like a much better show than it is.Love the product placement though.",5
"Boring and unconvincing","I was really looking forward to AppleTV and the prime show they were pushing. Eagerly turned it on this morning at 6am, even got up early...to be utterly disappointed.I couldn't even finish the pilot, it was so boring.Apple has so much money, can't they buy good writers?The best actors and tech cannot replace an interesting story and witty dialogue.I browsed what else is on offer, but the plots alone...inspite of some big names, it does not sound interesting at all.I cannot understand where those 9 star reviews are coming from. Watching my washing machine has more entertainment value.",1
"Watch Hoaxed first","This is as someone else already wrote ""A Left Wing"" ""Bought and paid For"" production. It is as it states a DRAMA in the fact that it is aDRAMA about their make-believe lives. Though as to actual news and news reporting. Nothing is exposed at all. I expected at least a little of real facts of what is going on in the world in say Venezuela, Syria, The Middle East that the real news fails to cover truthfully. NO! What I watched so far was 3 episodes of Holywood drivel that really doesn't appeal to NEWS at all. Sorry but there are many better series out there that deserve more recognition than this show.",5
"Disappointing","With such a stellar cast, I expected so much more. One episode was enough for me. Gratuitous F-bombs dropped every other sentence! Why is that necessary? Makes you wonder if real news anchors communicate in that fashion off camera...",1
"Started strong then woke happened","The show started strong going behind the scenes of network tv scandals. Then the woke police showed up and ruined the series. Maybe this is what really has happened to network tv.",2

"A better script wouldn't go astray","Whilst I've never worked on a morning show I find it hard to believe that there is as much swearing as they're able to pack into each 40 minute episode.I'm not opposed to a well placed f word at all but I'd like to listen to a show without cringing and having to filter every second word just to get an understanding of the plot.It's not intelligent, nor is a string of expletives flowing from a woman's mouth entertainment.Am finding it difficult to get past the fourth episode as a result.Find some better quality writers Apple",5
"crap","Crude. preachy. condescending. smug. females are good. abortions are awesome! rich-white-straight-men are bad. Bel Powley's over-acting would be too extreme for disney tv. and... climate change. climate change. climate change...",1
"What a waste!","Couldn't get even finish the first episode. Just didn't interest me at all, way too slow and boring.",1
"I can not belive the high ratings","Bad acting. This is not good at all. I can not belive the high ratings on this series! I am kind of picky though.
I say no no no to this.",1
"Awful!","I was looking forward to this show but this is so bad. Twitter and reviews have overhyped this show. Its badly written and I except better from the cast.",1
"Rehash","The first few seaons of this were ok, but this last season is just a rehash of what we have already seen. The writing is sloppy, as is the direction. And some of the acting is laughable - especially from Jennifer Anniston.There are many better series out there, so don't waste your time with this.The first few seaons of this were ok, but this last season is just a rehash of what we have already seen.

Pass.",4
"Childish script and some awful acting","If you told me a bunch of 15 year olds are writing the script I would believe you!
Aniston lately talks as if she wants to eruct..like constantly. Some of the actors are terrible, Billy Crudup rocks though!",5
"Hysterical, over acted","Jennifer obviously thought her hysterical, over acting would be a sure fire way to get some award....bzzzzzz NOT.
Billy Crudup (Cory) was fantastic.
The rest? A story of a bunch of corporate prostitutes justifying their Me-Too-Money-Grubbing actions.
Episode 8 was horrible! I FW through most of it.
And the obvious sell-out imbeded ads for hard whiskey were terrible, and one smoking commercial. So, All these educated liberal progressives need lots of hard booze constantly to succeed?
NOT! The lower the class and education, the more likely you are to smoke, drink excessively and die young. Is that the message?",3
"More Steve Carrell and Martin Short Please !","If only we could have made a way less obnoxious plot and theme that involves heroic woke journalists! My gosh, the ten minute cameo from Martin Short and Steve Carrell as they both played serious roles was the best part of the whole series. I actually am a Reese Witherspoon fan and Jennifer Anniston is mostly just a mediocre talent. Big names, didn't land a big punch. These solid ten reviews are a perfect example of a toxic culture that exists in many companies. It's just soooooo melodramatic and forced. Wasn't the entire fallout based on consentual sex? Are we all perfect human beings?",1
"Aniston's performance is weak, episodes never seem to end","You know how at the end of an episode they are queuing an ""ending"" song indicating some climax is coming, and the episode is about to end? Well, no climax is ever there and the episodes never seem to end. It's like they never know when to hit pause. Episodes are long and dragging, with numerous scenes that I found myself asking if it was relevant or provided any crucial information driving the story, the drama or the characters. Simply boring.To top it all off, I honestly think Aniston's performance is so weak it kills the show. I'm not sold on any emotion she tries to build, it's hard to watch.",3
"So boring...","A twenty minutes format per episodes would be more appropriate for this series. This is the example of the series we hate to watch. Nothing's interesting, Steve Carell only. I expected a serial thriller with lots of blood and a realistic universe of television a kind of Cutter...",1
"Me too.","Seriously where is Mitch's lawyers? Mitch cld take them to the cleaners.",5
"Utterly boring","Both Anniston and Witherspoon are good in their roles, but yet the series lacks something that I cannot put my finger on.
Perhaps it's the continuous rambling on so that you feel you are experiencing the whole thing in real-time or perhaps it's just mundane.
While I find the ""Matt Lauer"" story on whom I presume this is loosely based interesting, it could have been accomplished with a 2-hour drama - not a whole season worth of episodes - the content simply isn't that interesting.",3
"Subpar Aaron Sorkin Clone","Good cast and I would guess a fairly large budget, but it lacks subtlety both in characterisation and plot. Pilot only show for me I'm afraid.",4
"Too much negativity","I rated season 1 8/10 and brought it down to 6/10 after season 2, and now nearing the end of season 3, I rate it 4/10. Not only has its quality gone down season after season, I realized that it's too angry and gloomy for my taste. There is zero joy in this show, nor does it make you think about life in any meaningful way. It's just constant strife, drama, fighting, arguments, f-words, and not a single second to redeem all the negativity and gloom with some sense of relief or hope. The plot is dramatic in a superficial manner and none of the storylines or character developments are original or inspiring in any way.All the characters are self-centered, mostly power-hungry, egotistical, and cold. I see enough of such people in my daily life that I also don't want to have to see them on television, when I need a break from real life. I can watch actual news for that.I like Jennifer Aniston, Billy Crudup, and Steve Carrell. Billy Crudup is very good in this show. But I can't like it enough to see it just for his acting. Maybe if times were different and there wasn't already so much chaos and pain in the world as nowadays, I would have watched this show as an escape from reality? I am not sure.With limited time for entertainment in my busy life, I'd much rather watch Ted Lasso, a kind of show that reminds you of humanity in people, or White Lotus, which is funny despite its darkness and also thought-provoking. Another better show that comes to mind is Poker Face, a murder mystery that offers deeper insights into human psyche and relational dynamic.",4
"A soap opera","I was attracted to the show like a magnet after seeing the cast. And everyone delivers more or less, except Jennifer. This is her most annoying role and frankly, I don't understand how she can be that bad. Her sighing, moaning, huffing and puffing, 'Oh my god', 'Oh my gosh', 'Oh Jesus' in practically every single scene is unbearable. Have I mentioned 'Oh my god'. She has smiled maybe a few times in the two seasons. No charisma whatsoever. She portrays this entitled diva, oblivious when it suits her and awake when it suits her, but angry at everyone and worried about herslef all the time. I have wanted to quit shortly into the first season, but kept going because I have time to kill. Her as this big talent and host of a major national TV show is not believable. I wouldn't want to watch an inarticulate and annoying news anchor like her on a morning show so thank god it's not reality. No spice, no width or depth to her character whatsoever.The rest is fine, watchable. Soap about the world of entertainment. Oh god.",5
"Season 2 sucks","I can't say that season 1 was amazing, but at least had a clear theme and it was somehow entertaining, it was also well timed with the environment on 2019 of the ""me too"" movement and in a way was very similar to bombshell. There was a certain level of suspense and you were interested on the twists, it looked well finished. Reese Witherspoon's character was annoying
and pushy, but it was well balanced by the rest of the cast so it was tolerable.Now the second season actually feels like Reese Witherspoon's vanity project, her character is just not coherent, is no longer a journalist looking for the ""truth"" but more of a celebrity diva pushing for limelight. She sings, has a lesbian lover, has diva tantrums, etc. So it looks like a very desperate attempt to make Reese look edgy, and is a complete failure, she is the worst of the season. Then the whole storylines, nothing seems to go anywhere and even the Covid news seem dull in these series.I really doubt I would like to finish series 2 or what he series 3, we have to stop supporting vanity projects for Hollywood celebrities and look for original stories that focus on the story rather than the ""star"".",3
"Season 1 was great - Season 2 SUCKS!!!","First off, season 1 was great but season 2 sucksss big time! Season 1 we love how strong Alex ended the season it was awesome, then in season 2, Alex is a weak, whiny, little girl. Then she's becomes obsessed with something that just shows how weak they made this character cuz the Alex is season 1 would have denied and not given a crap. I so wish we would have seen how Alex had grown to be strong and fight for the good. The story was weak for season 2, as if they didn't expect it to be made and threw something together cuz it sucks. It's a strong cast of actress who need better writing material and acting guidance.",2
"Pathetic","Just because it seems like people aren't clear on this, they had to build a world in which people actually care about ""morning news,"" as if the small amount of people who care about the news at all aren't just spoon-fed their own propaganda on social media. So they've built a world virtually identical to reality besides that one fact, so building on rock bottom here. But hey there's no more solid of a structure to build on right? However, its been six episodes and I can no longer stomach a show in which I absolutely loathe every single character but one and a half. Whether that writing was intentional or not, with no development halfway through the season, I quit. Every single pompous, upper class, white America character in this, is absolutely infuriating and patronizing to watch. A bunch of people pretending that they're powerless until they become a true prick, and that they work so hard for their six figures. If this was a satire like a celebrity acting in ""Parasite,"" that would be brilliant, unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. The worst part is, art is a reflection of it's creator, so either this is actually how the writers or directors see themselves, or this just isn't art, and I don't know which is worse. Now maybe it does pick up, and there is lots of development made, and you can even sort of begin to try and relate to the characters. But it just was not paced quickly enough for that and what should have been the foremost development (like I don't know, the development of their second highest paid actress) is no where to be found, but sub-storylines like sexual tension between characters has been prominent from the beginning. To everyone giving this a high rating, I cannot fathom how you manage to respect any of these performances enough to willingly understand the actually good message this is trying to send, but I suppose I envy you, so congratulations.",1
"Double message","Awful! Saw the first few episodes and was captivated by the ""message"" that seemed to be recognizing the ""me too"" movement, especially in the media-- Seemed a profound storyline--But then, I was reminded that This ""Morning Show"" is just PROFANE rather then profound!It is for audience 18+ for a reason!
It is very graphic in sexual scene, which was completely disgusting, objectifying women all over again as sexual toys, forgetting every message of respect, intelligence etc, which got camouflaged in the first 4 episodes of the show by the fake introduction of wanting to recognize the ""me too"" movement. Reality: the morning show is just a facade for a lame piece for those who enjoy sexualizing women and playing them as a fragile broken sticks ready to be sexually used, misused and overused.Please make sure your kids and teens don't get near this garbage, lest this ""morning show"" twisted message will get into their brain.
It is 18+ for more then one reason.
Worse then any garbage movie or TV show I've ever come across to!",1
"overacting and dull","Big stars overacting or just looking tired, aniston can't decide if she is doing comedy or drama, her body language is clearly in a fun department, most dialogues and delivery on the psa level, all those characters are so elitists and far from regular people, it's just impossible to feel any sympathy for them, music is terrible and way too long, the climax is just a lazy ""the room"" level meta something, hope that dull show will never get renewal",2
"Utter Tosh","My wife wanted to watch this as she'd seen a trailer for it and it looked interesting. We watched the first episode and then gave up. I would have switched off after half an hour, my wife gave it a bit longer. We found the characters annoying and the whole show just not that interesting.",2
"Second season is about covid...","Is this a bad joke?Why all the good series are screwed up by bringing in covid and politics???The first season is very good but the second one is a very bad joke about covid.What a pity. This one used to be a good show...",2
"The Perception of Celebrities.","I wondered multiple times if it was intentional to display a disconnect between celebrities view of themselves and the public's view of celebrities. Acting was pretty good, but the emotional frustrations are lost on those that can't relate to out of touch, egotistical characters and their self perceived importance.",3
"fifty fifty","Not great expected more from this high budgeted cast and series could have been better 8 episodes would have been enough",4
"Starts promising","I appreciate this series is about important topics like #Metoo, people of colour, homosexuality, aging in the showbiz etc. Etc. Unfortunately, in large parts dialogues are terribly written, scenes are way too long, there is absolutely no sense for timing, and the score is terribly boring and mediocre. What a pity because the cast is excellent. End of season 2 is the point where I quit watching.",4
"Great show with a problem","So iv seen the first 3 and loved it however its hard to get emotionally attached to characters when you have to wait a week for a new episode. In terms of streaming tv apple may be re defining it but from the viewers point its like watching tv waiting another week for another episode when really apples content up and to now is very limited and really cant justify the 4.99 a month to watch single episodes of a show that will only push us to not want to get to know these characters in the past it worked because the content on tv was so vast we could jump station to station but to pay 4.99 then another 9.99 for amazon and again for netflix not many people can afford these luxuries when theres free to view tv already",5
"Watchable, but not particularly good","For starters, I've only watched Season OneAn inside look at the culpability of an industry in the predatory behavior from....people inside the industry who have every interest to make themselves look more enlightened than they actually are. Shows like this are truth and turned into fiction. The grey areas are all separated into a convenient black and white, and reality is restructured in a way that can be wrapped up with a triumphant moment and a neat little message.Aniston, Witherspoon, Duplas, and Crudup are all great. The rest of the cast is fine, but they're not given many big moments to impress. The Soundtrack is GOD AWFUL. The scene where two characters ""spontaneously"" sing a song with an absurd autotune was unintentionally funny. I tried to fast forward and I un-paused it in the middle of Alex's holding the final note and it sounded like a synthesizer, I cracked up.There are worse shows out there, but this is lowest common denominator type stuff.",5
"So boring and not compelling","This show is very boring. Nothing you haven't read on the news. Plus sorry, the story is just not good. Watched 1st ep and stopped. Uninteresting show",3
"Predictable","Sad, predictable attempt to capitalize on the MeToo movement. Jennifer Aniston's performance -- predictable. She has no range. Steve Carell -- predictable. He cannot act. Reese Witherspoon is the only one whose performance is solid and interesting. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty predictable as well and without range. The MeToo story appears to be the only thing driving the show; however, it's predictable.",2
"What?","Actors do play very well, but the story is more than boring. Sorry, but not worth looking.",2
"each star for the acting performances and one star for the story based on current events","My headline about sums up my review. my stomach is still digesting the horrors and stupidity of leftist propaganda when reeses character felt so proud for speaking out about her abortion at 15. everyone was only concern about ratings and then she suddenly became a beloved star of the nation? seriously? how much more bull is to come so i keep on watching just for the entertainment of seeing the bias and hypocrisy of hollywood in action. but then again, the democracy does not mean one sided impeachment or one sided delivery of liberal views that are mainly coming from the hypocritical nouveau riches whose views are only triggered from their own sense of guilt and having no spine. meetoo movement was somewhat explained in the show with some effort to show the hypocrisy of it all. there is always two sides of the story and the news and especially mainstream media will never show it because they have their advertisers to please and their own rich lifestyles to secure. do not even expect any fairness ever from the wealthy collecting high salary, unlike the president that is not collecting any salary for his work only hate from the left. wakeup hypocritical guilt driven socialists, free enterprise is displayed here in the show nothing more or less. if that was the aim of the show it is very true portrayal of the media business and its representatives, and thanks to the acting it is watchable. congrats on the choice of actors.",4
"Over use of the F word in season 3, looks childish","Again we see this irritating trend of over using the F word.I won't bother with a season 4.I'm just at the end of the first episode of season 3 and feeling so disappointed. Not keen to watch this anymore.Did they give the script writing to the local high school kids?Hollywood is trying its best to dumb down society. They want everyone to speak with a potty mouth. And I mean everyone.America is leading the world into the sewer with this childish potty mouth script writing. Way to go Hollywood. Way to go! Well done you bunch of dim wits. What next the C word? Then what? Every new show will compete to see who can write the most foul mouthed script.",4
"Still Beating that Dead Horse.","First of all I have to say Jennifer Aniston is Brilliant in this show. The depth of her character is amazing and she is the only reason I stuck with it as long as I did This is not the show I thought it would be. I'm not sure why but I expected it to be a comedy which it very much isn't. I think they would have done themselves a favor if they had included some light moments because the constant drama and overbearing darkness is incredibly depressing.I kept hoping they'd just move on from the sexual misconduct issue and tackle other issues but oh my god they just kept beating that dead horse until it was ground into the dirt then they continued to beat it and beat it and beat it. Good Grief at some point you'd think they change the story line? Come to some resolution and move on to another subject. If this is the only issue they wanted to tackle they should have just made a 2 hour movie of the week.I like Reese Witherspoon, I like her a lot, big fan of her movies and I'm sorry to say this but she is way too old for this character. This isn't a new character for her, it's a character she's played many times in many movies. Again, she's boring. What's with the racoon eyes? Is all that heavy makeup used to cover up wrinkles or bags because it sure isn't flattering. I'd rather see the wrinkles. What's up with her hair, what's up with everyone's hair? Did Jennifer have it in her contract that no one could have nicer hair than her? Honestly I've never seen Reese looking so terrible. I don't get it, at the beginning of the series she had long full hair then she shortens it and suddenly it's all thin and ratty? Reese if that's not a cheap wig you're wearing for the show then ask Jennifer about hair conditioner.Billy Cruddup? His character is a total ass, somehow I don't think that's a stretch for Billy.Mark Duplass? Who is this guy? He looks like a total schlub, he's not a very good actor and his character is a a spoiled brat. It's hard to believe that he's in charge of a major network news show.Steve Carrel looks fabulous. I've never seen him look more handsome. His character's long winded whining is painful to hear. So painful in fact that sadly whenever he comes on screen I skip ahead. I don't understand why he is in this show at all? He's just filler, he doesn't contribute anything. They could have cut all of his scenes and ti wouldn't make a difference.Nestor Carbonell, I love this guy, he is so underrated. He's a good actor and my god he still looks incredible. He should have had the Billy Cruddup role because he would have nailed it.The most disturbing thing about this show is no one wants to accept responsibility for their actions. Something that has become way too common in the world today. Something happens that you don't like, blame someone else. Flirt with a guy, get his attention, spread your legs for him or open your mouth then when he doesn't fall in love with you blame him, crucify him. I firmly believe that people should never get involved with anyone at work. I do think it's wrong. If you allow yourself to get in that situation take some responsibility for it.I think it's tragic that these women willing got involved with a man at work then blamed him for it not going the way they wanted. It takes away from the real victims who were sexually abused at work, women who were threatened with their job if they didn't perform. The first rule of sexual harassment is, tell the person to sop. These women didn't tell him to stop. It seems like this character would have stopped if he'd been asked to stop or told his flirting was inappropriate. If you don't follow the rules then you shouldn't be crying about the outcome. Accept responsibility for your own actions.It's the same thing with Deason Terry's character, if you allow people to treat you badly it's your fault. Don't allow people to treat you badly. Accept Responsibility for your own life. If you can't get what you want at 1 job get another job where people treat you the way you deserve to be treated.This show can be summed up with 1 cliche, ""If you always do what you always did. You'll always get what you always got"" wake up and brake the chain. Love yourself, be proud of yourself and don't allow anyone to treat you like you aren't just as important as they are.This show is not entertaining or informative, it's just plain sad.",4
"Not a feminist series","If this was intended to be a feminist series supporting the #MeToo movement, it leaves a lot to be desired. First of all, how on earth can you portray this topic from a ""neutral"" perspective as stated by Aniston and Witherspoon in several interviews? How on earth can this be feminist if the conclusion is that the harasser can learn from his mistakes, gifting him so much time on screen and such a melodramatic end for the viewers to eventually feel pity for the character? Because it feels like romanticization of the harasser, and sorry, but that doesn't help women that have been harassed/abused or contribute to the #MeToo movement at all.Witherspoon's performance feels off for me, maybe it's not her fault, honestly the character is not well built. The constant ""I believe in and seek truth, and I'm not Republican nor Democrat"" feels way too naive for a journalist of her age.Alex Levy's character is toxic, very toxic. I admit that the series is very addictive, but I felt distress after watching every episode. I want to think that the intentions were good but definitely they need to read more about women's equality and issues.",1
"There's Hype On This?","I tried to get into this show, but...Okay, so Reese Witherspoon is great and, for the most part, one can rely on the fact that the things she opts to be in are generally better-than-decent shows and flicks. That being said, yes, she's better-than-decent in this. The storyline, although nothing unique or anything that would actually wow you, didn't suck.So what's the problem, you ask? Well, to sum it up: Jennifer Aniston. I wasn't much into Friends when it was on, but I have seen a number of episodes and she pulled off the role she was playing just fine. In this show, however, her acting was so bad, I just couldn't get past it--for me, it just overshadowed everything else.Not sure how she got cast for the role, but wow, what a mistake.",3
"Finally sucked","Apple original?There is nothing new to be said, facts to be stated, opinions expressed ,or commentary about COVID, that we all haven't heard or experienced. Watching someone go through this on the show is far from entertainment.The final episode was terrible. There is not a human on the planet that has not been inundated with every angle, opinion, fact, theory, analysis, or statistic related to this nightmare plague. COVID is not entertaining.This show started off great, I loved all of season 1, and most of season 2, until the last episode.Granted, to was filmed 6 months to a year ago, so a little slack for that.If season 3 revisits the plague, I would rather watch a root canal.Get back to Original!",3
"Hysterical life in the US culture","A show about bipolar and egocentric actors with characters that are the center of the universe. All episodes about calling each other on cellphones and showing extremely crazy ideas and personalities, specially Mrs. Aniston. Unbearable. Do yourself a favor and check only the last minute and a half of each episode. You will save a lot of time. Whitterspoon is fun sometimes tho...the me too handled in different perspectives, but the excessive show off of the main characters exec producers doesn't make it too much favor to the ideas presented. Anyways, a US show for US audiences that will feel reflected on all the crazy personalities and mostly useless personal troubles.",4
"Amateur acting,bad played scenario-disappointing","Totally disappointed by this series.
Looks like cheap tv show maybe soap opera of the 80s,good actors like Aniston and Witherspoon acting and behaving like amateurs.The scenario too very naive and grotesque and bad played.",3
"Started out with good but slides way downhill","I'm glad you can pretentious presumptuous
what happened to the writers of the pilot?The music is junk and used to fill the void for good writingAll of a sudden they've made it into a 1980s dramaAnd if Reese Witherspoon can't keep the hair out of her left eye someone please show her what to do cuz it's really stupid lookingNo way does this deserve the rating it gets definitely manipulated by someone",3
"Aniston can't act","First season was OK. Second season was meh. Third season is not much better. But in all three, Jennifer's acting is just ugh! Dragging the rating down to a two (could've probably been a 4 maybe, if she just ACTs and not be busy making faces).Apart from the terrible acting of JA (and a couple others), I think the storyline has got from ""hm, alright, it's pretty bold"" to ""ugh, this is booorriing.."". I don't know how the show is gonna fix this, if they ever go into 4th season (maybe dropping JA for a start), but with resources that much, it really feels like a waste. Anyway, I should've known: a fast-paced series usually has subpar quality.",2
"Its ok.... but Jennifer Aniston is a bad actress!","I started and wasnt really attached to it....
Maybe because I cant take Jennifer Aniston as a serious actress.....",4
"Season one is great. Season two is terrible","I was riveted through the first 9 episodes of season one. Although I was disappointed in the finale (episode 10, season 1). I thought the finale was extremely unrealistic and illogical. Maybe it was an exercise in existentialism - ""That's not the way it really happened. It's just the way it seemed.'""Season two has digressed into nothing more than a melodramatic soap opera.I've never been a fan of Jennifer Anniston. I never found her good looking (she's not ugly). And I've never found her extremely talented (she's not terrible). I just never thought she was a big deal.But her character in this show is so miserable, she takes away from the show. Obviously she is a narcissistic irresponsible baby who's destroyed her family, and is destroying herself. And she's too stupid to realize it. But why make her a main character? Who can stomach her for any length of time? Season one doesn't spend too much time on her.Most normal people are happy to get a job that doesn't make them miserable, and will take care of them and their families. And they retire as soon as they can afford it.The Jennifer Anniston character is never happy starting with the first episode. She hates her job and industry. Why doesn't she just quit? She's made enough money to retire and live multiple lifetimes in filthy opulence. She's made more than enough to take care of her family. Why is she still working a job she hates? Because she's an idiot. An extremely annoying idiot.Season two is more time with the Jennifer Anniston character. I could never stand it when she is on screen. I just want to punch her in the face and tell her, ""Everything is not about you. Grow up and think of somebody else for a change. Instead of your self-anointed ""most precious"" feelings that nobody else cares about.""Season one had many different characters, plotlines and issues it dealt with. Season two has just slowed down to spend too much time with the stupid Steve Carell character still not being able to figure out what he did wrong. And the Jennifer Anniston character self emoting over what an idiot she is. Nobody cares anymore.And the Reese Witherspoon character was one of the few characters in season one who was not blinded by power, money and fame. She just wanted to do the right thing. But now in season two she's just as bad, shallow and putrid as the Jennifer Anniston character.The most interesting characters in season one are all gone in season two --- the girl who killed herself taking drugs, the British girl who quit because she couldn't deal with complications and ramifications of her naive mistake of having an affair with a co worker, and the season one principled Reese Witherspoon character, who is now selfish, petty and childish in season two.I give a 9 to season one.A 1 to season two.Half way between is my rating of 5.I'm on the season two episode where maybe the Steve Carell character crashes and dies in Italy. I wish the Jennifer Anniston character was with him. Because I'm sick of both. Not sure I'm gonna continue. The show has gotten so petty, following insufferable morons and their ignorance and narcissism. Nobody cares !!! Get back to the interesting issues !!!I would recommend season one to anybody. But season two just seems to be for soap opera lovers who like melodramatic pettiness.",5
"Stunning tension but disappointing at the end","Jennifer Aniston was great throughout the season, she acted as a rich and ambitious woman who was comfortable in man's club and had to had her way or else. The character was strong, dark and powerful if it could last till the end.Reese Witherspoon was great throughout the season, she acted as a reporter that was driven to seek the truth even this means telling on her own father. She was determent and capable, was not afraid of anything.Yet in the end, when Hanna died, after all the hard work and drama, and inspiring pep talk with her brother, everything coming down to the last single decision Reese must make to blow everything up, come on, I am waiting for a firework!But she caved, yeah she did. Out of respect of died girl, she just gonna throw every effort away let network win. After pep talk after pep talk after pep talk she finally got back and guess what, she followed the lead of Jennifer.And yeah, surprise, surprise, the dark Jennifer just flipped again....in the newsroom she magically returned to bright side, losing all the momentum she had built for a whole season, and back to the old drama queen Rachel.So here we are in newsroom, two heroes sit side by side. Reese, who has to be spoon fed so she could know how to be a hero, and Jennifer, everything must be about her hero.Two heroes with gigantic diapers.I gonna miss the time I spent with my son on PJ masks. At least they wear PJs.",5
"It's just too loud.","I stopped watching right after the moment Reese Witherspoon started yelling at a guy at the protest. Is this about depicting strong female figure? She just looked like an irrational unlikable person to me. There must be 1000 other clever ways to describe how female are strong and talented, not that it is neccessary because I don't need to be reminded.
It felt like that moment set the tone of the whole show, and I suddenly lost interest.",2
"Poor acting & weak storyline","Totally rubbish acting from the side characters and extras.Two favourite comedy actors was the reason i started watching this and totally disappointed.",3
"Time to tell the right story","In its inception, I found this show to be quite captivating. Although it exhibited a noticeable left-leaning perspective, the overall quality remained commendable, and the storytelling was engaging.However, with the arrival of its third season, the portrayal of the characters' responses to the capital invasion proved to be disappointing. The depiction of this event seemed exaggerated, manipulated by the media to appear more severe and dire than it truly was. It's essential not to overlook the context surrounding other significant events, such as the BLM protest, where numerous instances of police officers being assaulted, harassed, and subjected to death threats occurred.The stark contrast between the two seasons highlights a concerning shift in narrative focus and impartiality. While the show initially held promise, its handling of unfortunate events raises questions about its ability to provide balanced and nuanced storytelling moving forward.It's definitely important to strive for balanced perspectives in media and reporting. Diverse viewpoints can enrich understanding and promote empathy.",4
"Aniston too much Botox !!","Jeniffer Aniston supposed to have to many emotion in the show, and she only looks like a maniquí filled with hialuronic acid and have no face movement.This is a comedy/drama? For me was all victim, me too, tears, and drama + drama + drama.All characters are flat, unrealistic, and do not invoke any empathy",4
"Meh","I just finished watching the tenth episode. The finale was disappointing and totally unrealistic. The main reason I gave the ""2"" is because all of the main characters were not likable or relatable. I wanted to like it - I wanted the characters to become likable by being sorrowful for their short comings....instead they doubled down on their personality flaws, and I was left disappointed. Trashy characters with trucker mouths.....with trashy problems, self-centered and pompous problems....did not relate to me.",2
"The Morning Show could have been great if...","It were written as a comedy and from Steve Carrell's POV. Him and Aniston would get to showcase their comedic strengths then throw in Reese and the rest of the cast to build around them.It would have been cool to see them be funny and build their characters from there, then go through the drama of the bombshell.The overcussing and the over placement of iPhones and Macs was as if a 19 year old intern was the writer, following a college assignment to write a script for an Apple TV show.I'm a huge Aniston and Carrell fan, so perhaps I'm greedy when I was hoping to see their comedic chemistry from the start, but oh well.",3
"Please stop singing in this TV show","The episode where they were doing show tunes I couldn't fast forward quick enoughDear Lord whomever put the music together for this show should be removed of their position like they're hearing has been removed and they're good taste",3
"Reality TV","A show about the artificial atmosphere of the entertainment industry........are the actors really acting! Storyline is a rehash of current events in headlines that has been already been ""explored "" by several other productions. The characters portrayed are unlikeable without exception.
Aside from the above, show is loaded with an excellent cast, high production values and is very watchable.
One last comment: Weatherspoon is far more interesting as a blond.",3
"Promising storyline but sadly disappointing","Love the actors but getting straight to the point ..... the F bombs are exhausting. We couldn't get through the first episode due to the language. I'm super disappointed because I love these actors. The story looked very interesting but again.......finding better and more tasteful ways to express frustration and anger would be everything.",2
"Original but eh","Too modern with progressive bs added in the storyline, too self indulgent of rich people and their problems. Lots of big names in this show which for some may or may not be a good thing. Reese Witherspoon is the best thing about the show. She makes it tbh. Even if you hate the show, you wouldn't hate her or her character.",2
"Politically correct","Very predictable series. With ""correct"" actors and actresses. Reese is not the one from Big Little Líes ...
Comedy-drama for a confessional audience and devoted to political correctness.",5
"Season 2 is WEAK!","I enjoyed the first season but the second season was a real drag, easily predictable and just weak.Jennifer Aniston character in season 2 is an neurotic and highly unlikable. So Jennifer must be a really good actress, because I did not like her character. And for me to say I don't like Jennifer Aniston is something I thought I would never say. Reese was no better - in fact the only bright spot was Billy Crudup's character who did a believable job handling these out of control egos (speaking of the characters and not the real people).I hope season 3 is better because I do like the concept. I just want more dynamic dialogue and situations.",5
"great everything...futile concept","I remember first seeing this and thinking...Aaron Sorkin take notes!!...this is how to make a show about news!!...because this show is ten times what the newsroom was...and i have to say it because the newsroom happens to be rated higher than the morning show...which is blasphemy...but as i Kept watching...the talking too much just like with the newsroom...starts to get to me and i realised it's impossible to make a show about news without all the frantic talking...because that's literally what happens there...with this new information...i realized that...this genre just cannot exist...it's impossible to make an interesting show about news...it's impossible...i watched five episodes and i realized that i did not care...at all!...and they even had reese witherspoon!I think it all comes down to the premise or the whole concept...or again maybe it's just me...i just don't care about how news is made...in real life i don't even watch the news...this show though has many things going for it...the personal lives of the characters are very believable not too dramatic to be unrealistic...very well written...it knows how to balance between the news and the outside drama...the big flaw is with the Mitch subplot...it's completely ridiculous...it's not well placed and just hangs over everything...maybe he shouldn't have been fired...maybe that would have worked...it's a good idea it just feels like we should forget about him as a character and just feel the aftershocks...but then it's Steve Carell...so he has to have screen time and he affects the plot in zero way...he's just baggage to the story i feel...but it's a decent show...",3
"Too early for me to review this","I've only watched the pilot and the very beginning of the second episode...I find it cliche",3
"Noble themes but overrated.","I feel like this show has an extremely inflated rating due to the topics it covers and how it portrays bravery and standing up for what you believe is right. These themes shouldn't excuse its lackluster writing and at times silly plot.Additionally, so much of the story is told through Alex's perspective, who is one of the most unlikable characters of the whole cast. Maybe that is her point and I'm missing it but at the end when she does a 180 for 30 seconds and the viewer is supposed to view her as a nice person the whole time is cheap and stupid.",4
"Disappointing and way too much cussing","I was really looking forward to this show, but it took 3 different sittings to finish the first episode alone. Occasional cussing in a show may help convey a strong feeling in a scene, but when every few words is some form of f$& it just becomes cussing to cuss. I was so fed up with it that I counted during the last 17 minutes and it was used 10 times. The show itself says that Bradley Jackson was fired for using the word twice on live TV - so give us a break from it.",5
"90% of the time, slow burn is an excuse","I can't understand the raving reviews for this. It's not the worst, but it's not good. The ""slow burn"" is just boring, drawn-out, overdramatic set-up. I don't mind political messages, and I align with these views, but you really can't excuse what's plain bad pacing. I don't care how good it gets.",4
"Peddling a leftist agenda, but still a decent watch","The Morning Show (AKA Morning Wars in Australia) is dramatic, high quality and engaging. Nevertheless, I would have scored this TV series higher if it didn't push such a clichéd left-wing agenda. I don't believe in Hannah's struggle and I almost rolled my eyes when she committed suicide. In this TV show, it seems the women make a choice, and then because they regret that choice, it's somehow the man's fault. In no way am I condoning sexual abuse committed either by a man or a woman, but the whole ""we need to dismantle the patriarchy because men are pigs"" attitude is just a bore. The show would have turned out to be much more interesting if Mitch was accused of sexual misconduct, his name is dragged through the mud, his life is ruined - but by the end of the season, he gets his retribution against those who falsely accused him. However, that would fly in the face of the left-wing's idea that women are angelic and can't do any wrong. Lastly, in Australia, workplace relationships are very commonplace so seeing it made into such a big deal is a bit strange - obviously a cultural difference between here and the US.",5
"Unconvincing","Truly the age of great television has passed. I got 25 minutes into this and was completely unconvinced by every character and every line.Maybe there is some post-modern crap going on here, where everyone is suppose to be fake, because, you know, it is TV about TV, and how drama is more real that the news....zzzzzzThere was a kids' show when I was young that had the opening line, 'Why not turn off the TV set and do something less boring'.Indeed.",4
"Great Story Line but off Key and Long","Love the message close to home but too long for a series. It woud have been a great movie. High rating becos of star power.",3
"Would be one star if not for billy crudup.","It sucks. Little actually happens. It's a drama, but in such a way that it doesn't affect you or make you relate to the show at all. Boring. Do not watch this show, it's a waste of time.",2
"Dark Lightning","The lighting is horrible. Very dark.
Plot is predictable. Not a fan. 1 episode and I'm out.",3
"Simply Terrible..","I have never rated a TV series this low in my entire life. I started watching The Morning Show for its commendable cast and seemingly interesting story. And the show did actually start out interesting; however, the way it progressed later on left me wondering how in the world such an annoying, insufferable piece of junk would garner an average rating of 8.3. Both Jennifer Anniston and Reese Witherspoon, actresses I truly like and respect, were extremely vexing, and this has 100% something to do with the horrendous, clichéd writing, which, by the way, I do not understand why portrayed Mitch Kessler to be this huge sexual predatory monster. First you got this girl Mia who, from what I understand, reported Mitch because she started feeling ""low"" and ""degraded"", (and selfish, may I add), after her CONSENSUAL relationship with him. And then you got a real beauty with this girl Hannah who made herself to be the most emotionally-damaged, innocent assailant with no fault of her own. It is really truly sad to see how a guy like Mitch Kessler, who may not be the quintessential example of a moral being, is being portrayed like that when you got real sexual predators out there who veritably sexually abuse women.
Huge disappointment from Apple Tv+.",4
"I couldn't get through the first episode","Websters says the f word is a meaningless intensive. Let's get real here. The writer of the script has a limited vocabulary and thinks if he/she repeats offensive words they somehow ga8n meaning. Sadly this is not the case. Creativity to express feelings and situations has left us with a vocabulary fit for a ten-year old street bum without intelligence or education. One or the other would have been enough.",3
"Bad dirty language","Bad language, disappointed
Dont like any of the cast members, all of them are negativ characters.",3
"Not what I was hoping for!","When I saw all the great cast on this show I was looking forward to watching. Not so much now!! The ""F"" word and G**D*** are used too much for me. It's almost comical. I've been told that using those words just proves your ignorance. When you can't find an appropriate word to use.....just add an F or a GD. It's said in just about every line. It's sad there aren't shows that you can watch now days that you don't have to worry about hearing those words. I think a show can be just as good without all of that!!",5
"You should've postponed season 2 premiere that so you could've","You must feel so bad, such a shame isn't it? Knowing that you could not cover Russia incursions. You must be smashing your desks, or something, right now. If only you knew and could've postponed season 2 premiere date. What a shame. I mean, Season 1 was very good but then in season 2, they try to cover everything. I mean come on, I don't want to be reminded of certain reality stuff when I'm just sitting back and trying to enjoy my free time dude! I didn't wait for season 2 for different plots! The main plot is almost buried here! It becomes a side plot. I'm not exaggerating. It really does. And what they did with that one character, Bravo. To create a drama, to keep viewers, they literally change this character into someone else; someone totally different. Jesus christ. Why watch it, man? Each episode betrays previous episode! OH? OH!!? SEASON 3!!! You're gonna cover Russia incursions in Season 3!!! I can't wait to watch it. Wow. Greatest show. Hey, by the way, dare to cover Biden son's laptop?",1
"Seriously?","You seriously couldn't think of your own original story for a show? I watched this for maybe 30 minutes. If i want to hear cussing like this I'll just go to my local Walmart. It was painful to watch Steve Carrell in his first scene. Not that he should always play lovable characters...but yuk, just yuk...sad...",2
"Yep","Fantastic performances, excellent writing, and awesome start for Apple streaming. I highly recommend this show.",5
"Social comment overshadowed by awful performances, casting & characters","Season 1 storyline covers some delicate topics exceptionally well, especially the various shades of grey associated with sexual misconduct in the workplace.The whole plot is to depict various social comment, however the main frustration throughout is the casting, performances and characters of the two leads. Aniston and Witherspoon are full of agro, highly dysfunctional and dislikeable from moment one. And this overshadows the social comment and general storyline.Add to this their acting is awful. Neither can do drama and really shouldnt have been cast. If it wasnt for the remaining cast especially Billy Crudup the entire show would have been a flop.8 for season 1.0 for season 2.",4
"Letterboxed","This show will never be seen anywhere except on 16:9 televisions. Yet, it was recorded in some other ratio, and has black bars at the top and bottom. Why?",3

"Season 3 review only (my review for 1-2 would be much higher)","The third season is overflowing with triggers for anyone who is sober or struggling with addiction, as they unrealistically drink at all times of day and openly with constant single shots of whiskey bottles and vodka (why do they need their own close-up if that is not part of the storyline I do not know). No one actually lives and works like Mad Men 1960s, this is not realistic that people would be drinking this amount without trying to hide it. There is also so much aggression and exhausting storylines in the third season; just watching one episode leaves you feeling depressed and dark so what is the point? I know that this is a ""drama"" after all but why would anyone living in such a dark world with all we have going on in real life want to sit through this very heavy show with characters who are all so terrible you don't really care what happens to them? The only highlights are Mark Duplas, Reese Witherspoon, Karen Pitman and Billy Crudup because they can act their butts off. But they must leave this set exhausted from having to act out intense scene after intense scene. The writers need to calm down the booze for one, and give us just a splash of light PLEASE if returning for a season 4...",4
"Surprisingly Good, but trying too hard.","The best role in the show is Mark Duplass as the Morning Show EP.Reese plays her character way too hard and ends up not being very likable cause she tries too hard.I like Steve Carell's acting a lot but he's not in the show enough to garner any major awards nods (Aniston, Reese and him all got GG nods and I dont think they deserved).The HFP tries too hard to be edgy and has their favorites and I think they gave Apple+ way too much credit.Is this show good? Yes. For the money they spent on it should it be better? Yes.Billy Crudup is a pig in real like but I liked like in Gypsy (cancelled for no reason) but he should have been considered for an award.They focus way too much on the Today Show Scandal Metoo movement for my liking. They could have done more episodes on real world news and been better for it.I have no clue where they are going with season two for this show. Seems like Big Little Lies (HBO) concept; 1 season and done.I would prolly tune in for a season 2 but I'm not on the edge of my seat for it too return.",1
"Steve Carrell lured me, memories from Bruce Almighty","One of my favorite scenes is when Steve Carell was an anchor, and Jim Carrey was controlling his speech, giving him a Tourette's syndrome like tick. Classic comedy gold. Oh wait, that's from Bruce Almighty, not this self-proclaimed ""drama"" where nearly EVERY single scene contains a hissy fit tantrum by one or more of the main characters at once, similar to a tantrum my 3-year-old could throw if I say it's time to go home from the playground, only in this painful to watch show, it's usually over trivial and minuscule, first world problems.During each long-winded monologue of whining, moaning, sadly sighing out of distress to further exaggerate their oh so attractive display of misery, I found my myself asking over and over the same question that Carell's character asked in the opening scene of the show, ""who died?""",4
"An embarrassment to TV News","This show is such a joke. It is so far from accurate TV News. Aniston is whiney. The writing is ridiculous. The morning show set is too dark for a show in the morning. The way they sit on the set and talk to the camera is so unrealistic. They are always angry about something. Crudup is the only actor on this stupid show that makes sense..The producers either need to watch real TV news or hire someone as a consultant who actually worked the TV business for years.. I will give it one positive, that is some of the issues they cover are on target, but the delivery isnt. The show really makes me gagg.",1

"Love This Show, as a conservative.","The liberalism, in the first few episodes, is so over the top and drowning that the gaps in the story/narrative are as unnoticed as a bullet in the foot. Great actors. Great performances. However, it's a horse with blinders.The hypocrisy and inconsistencies in ideology are the antithesis of good writing. It's a polished turd. Aniston, Witherspoon, and Carrell give it a draw and shine (although, everyone without those names are the best parts). But it's overly-contrived, really derivative, and reaching to be considered for acclaim.I hope some of the supporting cast do far better than the agents for the main stars following this. This is going to be forgotten real quick, if anyone actually signs up for Apple's service to watch it.",5

"The Final Five Minutes Cost this Series three ***","I watched all ten episodes of 'The Morning Show'. I never felt the need to watch, but it was enjoyable enough. I like Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell a lot. And Jennifer Aniston is actually pretty good in the role of a hard-bitten anchor-woman. And the show's subject, Sexual Abuse in the workplace, is timely. So, ten episodes.Or actually 9.9 episodes. For those 9.9 episodes I was going to award it a solid '8'.But the final five minutes? Who wrote this? Who or possibly What? What mechanized device with the purpose of making all dialogue sound robotically created, wrote this?You will laugh. I guarantee. Which would not be bad if that was the finale's objective. But it wasn't. This is serious stuff, the culmination of a serious 'Will he or they get away with it?' story. It's a '#ME TOO' of a story, no less. Serious enough that what you want to remember about the series is the answer to that question. But instead of ending the show on that note, Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Aniston go ..... politically-correct crazy, politically-correct nuts. Not that politically correct is a bad thing. But the way they state their correctness. The dialogue. The rant. The suggestion that their rants are spur-of-the-most spontaneous remarks.It's ... it's .... it's as though a juvenile (an untalented juvenile) wrote and directed that finale.And that, I'm sorry to say, Is what I remember most.",5
"Turns out to be a big FRAUD at the end","A very entertaining show that gets you seriously hooked up since episode 1. An intriguing plot with a wise notion that social issues have different points of view that have to be considered and that the world is not just black or white. And then... In the last episode a complately unrealistic turn of events is procured to prove that there is actually only one point of view, the righteous one. Deus ex mahina saving metoo hashtag at all costs. Logic can be discarded when ideology is to prevail. Disappointing.",5
"Second season seems better","I've originally rated this 4/10 after having watched first season.I've also watched second season, and this one seems better. Although I think the storyline could have adhered a bit more to reality: Mitch in Italy while the first western country gets to deal with COVID19 large outbreaks, in reality he'd took the advantage of that situation for a come back in the news industry (perhaps by not being an anchor but an executive). Same goes for Alex when she gets there.But I also get the idea of depicting all these people as self centered and narcissists not able to see what is in front of them, except in reality they'll lose opportunities to do their job which will be taken by others.Loved Valeria Golino's performance, I couldn't think of a better Italian actress nowadays to play that character.Still too many cliches when it comes to Italy: eating ice cream on Como's lake sidewalk during February? Too cold to do that (it's not Minnesota, but also nor Casablanca!).Paola driving a FIAT 128 from the '70s?!? You won't see that car on the streets aside for in a parade of historical cars: better if she drove a FIAT Panda model from the late '90s if the intention was to portray her character as a poor documentarist.Anyway there are plenty of hilarious scenes worth watching in this second season, thus I give it a solid 7... averaging with a 4 I gave to first season, the overall vote so far is a 5.",5
"On line series ...","However the story really awful but the main target is really good ...
I believe watching whole the series is wasting the time !And session 3 ?!!! Not need to wait ...",5
"ways for expensive shows to be bad.","From ny timesThe season finale of ""The Morning Show"" is available now, on Apple TV+. Watching this show is like having that dream where there's suddenly another room in your house you've never been to, but instead of discovering new rooms you discover new ways for expensive shows to be bad.",4
"Infidelity","The overwhelming acceptance of infidelity on this show is nauseating. Steve Carell as the sleaze ball cheater, no one even remotely bothered by his infidelity to his wife. Is this the new socially acceptable norm? ""Everybody does it."" No, no they do not.",3
"Conventionally told, dialogue heavy. Interesting theme.","Good theme, interesting to take a peek to this part of media biz. After having been with a journalist for years myself, I was intrigued how this would play out. It is an ambitious show as well as the (mainly) lead female characters are portrayed. Maybe too ambitious, meaning it is hard to get attached or to even care for lead characters. It is hard to follow a show if you can't build empathy for characters.Main storyline is conventionally told and dialogue heavy TV, you would fully get the show as a radioplay as well. Not bad dialogue, but it could be less. It's missing the flow, tension and permanent time pressure in this world. The show 24 (with Kiefer Sutherland) over a decade ago presented a vital urgency that would have been helpful here as well.A lot of swearing and yelling instead of giving the perfomers a chance to play certain situations more subtle. The is room for development.Male characters are rather passive background players, sometimes crying, asking to be understood, talking about their emotions, relationships or yelling or being stubborn corporate powerheads (... after first 2 shows). So men are stereotypical, using mostly vulgar language, are not allowed to be sympathetic or likeable people? Plus they are subordinating to the character plots about ego and carreer of the female leads who are either power hungry themselvels or inventive with explosive idealism? Is this so? Acting is fine and there are some nice and well played scenes in it.Summarized, what somehow appears to be off is the general angle on human beings. Cynisism is a big part of this particular biz, but it also appears as if the makers are not too fond of their own species. Maybe that was an intention. As always, all is about personal taste.",5
"starts well but get worse soon","I watched first season in 2024. It starts well and builds characters for first 5 episodes, but over time it feels hard to like any of characters in the show and to keep watching it. The pacing gets really slow, with pointless long slow motion scenes and poor direction.I thought for some time that we will get good look at two faced characters and manipulations, but in the end it sticks to politically correct one side of the problem which is a let down.I think this show got the awards mostly because it fitted the news agenda back in the days, but over time I cannot justify those, as I kept falling asleep in last 5eps of 1st season and honestly juz waited for it to finish.",5
"Compelling, but triggering","Excellently done with such an incredibly talented cast! Each character evokes such emotion. A warning though, for those who have experienced sexual trauma, the last three episodes were much more triggering than I expected.",1
"The Morning Show Season 2, On Apple TV+, Takes The Scenic Route To Arrive At Hard Truths","The Morning Show is what happens when The Newsroom goes to therapy. I enjoyed The Newsroom in the only manner Aaron Sorkin shows can be enjoyed - for its loud condescension towards the ordinary viewer. It was attractive in a haughty way, like that self-taught activist who thinks he/she is too smart to entertain you. The one jarring aspect, however, was the moral fortitude of every single reporter at the network. They were essentially good humans struggling to do a good job. Even the shady ones (like Don) turned good. The show was based on this job - the intellectual anatomy of American news, the politics, the coverage, the chemistry and the sociocultural misgivings. The characters were ideological surrogates.Read the full review on Film Companion.",3
"Dame Diane Lane Syndrome","I suppose I'll have to explain that title. When my ex and I first moved in together, it was our first apartment with cable TV. One night, a movie came on, ""Ladies And Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains"". It was, of course, awful, and featured a 15 year old Diane Lane who would still be in a paper bag if she had been required to act her way out of one. We started referring to her as Dame Diane Lane, which of course amused us considerably.Fast Forward a few years. Ms. Lane has put in the work, attended the classes, worked in theater...she's a damn fine actresses , and good on her, sez I.The same can be said for Ms. Aniston. Long dismissed as ""that sit-com babe with the hairdo"", her work on this show is nothing short of amazing.And good on her, sez I...",5
