        "This project aims to predict the winner of the 2024 presidential election in the state of Virginia. The approach to developing this predictive model using voting data from presidential elections for Virginia from 2000 to 2020 and NHGIS county data, which contains county stats from every state in the country.\n",
        "This data was cleaned and preprocessed -- accompanied with some EDA -- to help determine which variables will be the most useful to creating a model. The main variables that were included in the data to train and test our model were year, county FIPS code, population, and the total votes. We additionally chose to focus on the variables pertaining to income, age, education, and race statistics in hopes of building a more accurate model. The model we chose to explore was a random forest, both with the additional variables and without. Additionally, county adjacencies data was used to create chloropleth plots that helped visualize these results over a map of Virginia, as well as compare them to the actual results of the 2020 election to compare and contrast the outcomes. The random forest model predicted the number of democrat votes and the number of republican votes for each county in Virginia. The data from 2000-2019 was used to train the main model, and the data from 2020 was used to test the main model, since the candidates are the same as the upcoming 2024 presidential election. Overall, the main model predicted that there will be about 2140696 votes for the democratic candidate and about 1995143 votes for the republican candidate. The r-squared value of about 0.9458 indicated a great fit. We ran a second model with our variables of interest, but used 2000 data to train it and 2004 data to test, due to missing values. Here, the model predicted more republican votes than democratic votes, and had a slightly lower r-squared value of about 0.8127. The chloropleths plots generated based on our main model data visually appeared to be similar to the results plotted from the that of the actual election outcome, although slightly more colored towards the democrat party ruling."

        "From the NHGIS county data, we also retrieved the population values for each county in Virginia. This was a bit of a challenge, as the data had values in ranges of years, rather than specific population values for each individual year. Thus, we created a for loop that iterates through each year in the voting data file, and imports the population values from the closest year available in the NHGIS county data. By doing so, we were able to keep all of the voting data, while still having semi-accurate population values for each county.\n",

        "For the county adjacencies data, cleaning mainly consisted of dropping NA's. We looked at outliers with a boxplot, but did not find any that required any log transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the voting data, we started with dropping NA's. Then, we looked at outliers with a boxplot and did log transformations on the candidatevotes and totalvotes variables. Then, we looked out the election data to determine which was the most informative. Based on the candidates and how informational the voting data was, we decided to use the 2020 data as our test data, and the rest of the data as our train data. Our next step was to combine the party votes. Each candidate was listed in the original data with their party affiliation and votes, which resulted in each county having multiple rows. We wanted each county to only have 1 row of data, so we aggregated counts for the votes by party, and only included Democrat and Republican since this is what we wanted to use for the model. Then, we calculated the total votes for each county by finding the sum of the democrat and republican votes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cleaning the NHGIS county data came with a few more challenges.To start, the second row of the dataframe had to be made as the header since that was the row that contained the actual descriptive column names. If left as was, this would have interfered with data types of the variables of interest, such as them not being all numerical. After removing that first row, there was still an issue with the data types, so certain variables had to be changed from objects to integer data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, some of the county data files, like ./0002_ds176_20105_county_E.csv contained extra rows at the end with information in an incorrect format, which were dropped. However, after looking further into these files, some did not contain data from the state of Virginia, which was what we desired, so not all of these county files ended up even being used. Instead, we ended up using all the files that ended with 'M' instead of 'E' and combined all the data, since each file contained data for a different set of years.\n",
        "Once we combined all of the files, we isolated only the Virginia data. Then, we wanted to isolate and focus on the variables of interest. Each variable -- income, age, race, and education -- had numerous columns designated for values in very small, specific ranges. To make our analysis easier, we wanted to combine the columns into broader, but still informative ranges. To do so, we had to create our desired ranges for each variable and aggregate the counts from the combined dataset, for our new columns. Then, we replaced the existing columns with our columns that contained aggregated counts for our desired ranges, for each variable of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "After getting this new dataset with our variables of interest, we looked at outliers with boxplots. All of the variables displayed outliers, so we made sure to do log transformations on all of them.\n"

        "## **Conclusion**\n",
        "In this project, we attempted to predict the winner of the 2024 presidential election in the state of Virginia. The data used for this project included historical Virginia voting data from the years 2000-2020, NHGIS county data, and population data from each county to generate a predictive model. Additionally, county adjacencies data was used to visually present and compare our predicted results against actual election outcomes for the year 2020, since we have access to that data and the candidates running are the same. Our methodology consisted of data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model development to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data cleaning and preprocessing took up the majority of our efforts. We addressed challenges such as missing values, outlier detection, and data type inconsistencies, ensuring that our model was built upon a clean, yet informative dataset. Our greatest challenge at this step came from combining a variety of separate data frames that each consisted of data we wanted to analyze, with difficulties like renaming columns and iterating through one dataset to concatenate it to the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "We had set out to focus on including relevant demographic and economic variables such as income, education, age, and race, in hopes that it would allow us to capture some important socio-political dynamics influencing electoral outcomes in Virginia. However, we experienced several issues with the data. Mainly, much of the data had missing values, so we had to drop the most recent -- and what probably would have been the most accurate -- data. However, we decided to still go ahead and use this data to see how it would impact our model.\n",
        "\n",
        "A random forest model proved to be apt for our task, offering a balance between interpretability and predictive performance. The main model was trained on data from the year 2000 to 2019, and then tested on the 2020 data, which featured some of the same candidates as the anticipated 2024 election. The high R-squared value of 0.9458 indicates a strong fit of the model to the training data, bolstering confidence in its predictive capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model with the additional variables of interest was trained on data from the year 2000, and tested on data from the year 2004. Although this data did not feature the same candidates as the anticipated 2024 election, it still allowed to see the impact of variables like age, income, education, and race on the number of republican and democrat votes. Our R-squared value here was slightly lower, at 0.8217, but still indicated a strong fit of the model to the training data. However, it is interesting to note that this model predicted that there would be more republican votes than democratic votes. This may have been true of previous years, and it is definitely a possibility for the upcoming election.\n",
        "\n",
        "Without a doubt, there are limitations to our approach, including the idea of relying on past election data to predict future outcomes. This limitation stems from the fact that electoral dynamics may evolve over time due to shifting demographics, changing political landscapes, and unforeseen events. We also had many missing values in the data used for our approach, so finding a more accurate, up-to-date dataset would have strengthened our model. Our model's ability to adapt to changes can be enhanced through continuous updates and refinement on the included demographic variables. Combining our main model with our second model -- assuming that we can find up-to-date data for the years in which we had missing values -- would be the next approach to future work.\n",
        "\n",
        "While it is true that electoral dynamics may evolve over time due to shifting demographics, changing political landscapes, and unforeseen events, our model has the ability to adapt to these changes. Not only does it introduce randomness into the analysis, taking into account the possibility of these changes, but we can also add any additional variables to our model that may arise in the future. Additionally, the inclusion of county adjacencies data enriched our analysis by capturing spatial dependencies. In this way, the chloropleth maps we made helped to visualize the predictive changes of political viewpoints in a geographical context of Virginia. In comparison to the 2020 election results, the chloropleths maps from the predictive model were similar, but slightly more democratic leaning, as a couple more counties were blue in the midsts of majortively red surrounding areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "In regards to this project's opportunity for future expansion and research, one potential avenue is to incorporate additional datasets. Data from the entire country, not just the state of Virginia, could help further strengthen this model. On a deeper level, a wider set of data including socio-economic indicators, political sentiment analysis from social media, or local political events, could further uncover predictive trends on a more county focused level. Additionally, different predictive model methods could be tested and compared against this random forest approach.\n",
